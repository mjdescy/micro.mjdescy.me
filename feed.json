The drive, unlike one mapped with `SUBST`, will persist across reboots, and it will have full Recycle Bin support.\n\nI love it, and think I should try to write a PowerShell or Python script that will create such mappings without having to edit a .reg file manually.\n\n[^1]:\tBelieve it or not, but I still remembered the SUBST command from my MS-DOS days in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n[^2]:\tI take it for granted that it is preferable to have the safety net of the Recycle Bin, in case I delete something accidentally.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Over the past week, I played through <em>Children of Morta</em> on my Nintendo Switch. It is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike\">Roguelike</a> game built around combat and dungeon crawling, with several gimmicks to keep it interesting. There is a strong story element and a very enthusiastic narrator; unfortunately, I didn’t think the story amounted to much in the end.</p>\n<p>Overall, I enjoyed it. It reminded me a little bit of the <em>Diablo</em> games, though my memory of those games is quite hazy.</p>\n<p>At first I found it nearly impossible to beat the first dungeon’s boss. I could reach the boss from my very first run, but I could not defeat it. I discovered that you have to grind and level up your characters’ stats. Once I did that many, many times, my characters were strong enough to kill that boss, and basically everything else that came afterward.</p>\n<p>I very much appreciated that you did not have to mash the attack button endlessly during combat.

				"content_text": "Over the past week, I played through *Children of Morta* on my Nintendo Switch. It is a [Roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game built around combat and dungeon crawling, with several gimmicks to keep it interesting. There is a strong story element and a very enthusiastic narrator; unfortunately, I didn’t think the story amounted to much in the end. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed it. It reminded me a little bit of the *Diablo* games, though my memory of those games is quite hazy. \n\nAt first I found it nearly impossible to beat the first dungeon’s boss. I could reach the boss from my very first run, but I could not defeat it. I discovered that you have to grind and level up your characters’ stats. Once I did that many, many times, my characters were strong enough to kill that boss, and basically everything else that came afterward.\n\nI very much appreciated that you did not have to mash the attack button endlessly during combat. Instead you rock the right analog stick in the direction you want to loose your arrows or swing your sword.

These thoughts scared her so much that she was afraid to fall asleep; my wife or I had to stay with her night after night in her bed to comfort her.

Those answers only made him more scared. Upon hearing them, he suddenly realized that he might not die in the same place as us or his sister, and became loudly distraught that he might end up somewhere where he couldn’t get to us anymore.</p>\n<p>He then asked when my wife and I, are going to die. That did not bother me. When he asked when his sister was going to die, I teared up because it seemed unimaginable.

				"title": "🎙 Tim’s Back! On Substack!",
				"content_html": "<p>The best podcast episode I listened to today was <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+LsGPupHY4\">the unexpected return of an old favorite: <em>Tim Goodman’s TV Talk Machine</em></a>. The show ended in 2020. I never unsubscribed, and was surprised this week to find new episodes waiting for me. I would not have noticed them if there hadn’t been a redesign of Overcast, my podcast player, for me to look at this week.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s been 612 pandemic-fueled days. But we’ve taken the tarp off the TV Talk Machine, replaced a few parts, and are ready to kick it into gear.</p>\n<p>Tim spent the last two years writing TV scripts! He’s going to keep doing that, and write a book, and also has launched a newsletter on Substack so he can write about television again. And… did we mention the TV Talk Machine is back, too? It’s true!</p>\n<p>In this episode Tim explains where he’s been, where he’s going, and the origin of his new project, which launches today! Also Jason raves about “Station Eleven” and believe it or not, there’s a letter from a listener!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tim Goodman was a TV critic who had clearly burned out by early 2020. He and co-host Jason Snell ended the podcast shortly after Goodman quit his TV critic job and started a secret (at the time) TV development deal.

				"content_text": "The best podcast episode I listened to today was [the unexpected return of an old favorite: *Tim Goodman’s TV Talk Machine*](https://overcast.fm/+LsGPupHY4). The show ended in 2020. I never unsubscribed, and was surprised this week to find new episodes waiting for me. I would not have noticed them if there hadn’t been a redesign of Overcast, my podcast player, for me to look at this week. \n\n> It’s been 612 pandemic-fueled days. But we’ve taken the tarp off the TV Talk Machine, replaced a few parts, and are ready to kick it into gear.\n> \n> Tim spent the last two years writing TV scripts! He’s going to keep doing that, and write a book, and also has launched a newsletter on Substack so he can write about television again. And… did we mention the TV Talk Machine is back, too? It’s true!\n> \n> In this episode Tim explains where he’s been, where he’s going, and the origin of his new project, which launches today! Also Jason raves about “Station Eleven” and believe it or not, there’s a letter from a listener!\n\nTim Goodman was a TV critic who had clearly burned out by early 2020. He and co-host Jason Snell ended the podcast shortly after Goodman quit his TV critic job and started a secret (at the time) TV development deal.

				"title": "🇺🇦 I stand with Ukraine and my heart breaks for them",
				"content_html": "<p>My little corner of Micro.blog has not had much to say about the invasion of Ukraine. This is probably a good thing, because it provides me a respite from grim news and unsubstantiated reports from the front lines. If I still had a Twitter timeline to scroll through, I’m certain that it would be full of performative, meaningless platitudes<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>, and strident back-and-forth arguments from people who (like me) have no bearing on the outcome of the conflict about what should be done about it.</p>\n<p>All I can say right now is that the war is very upsetting to me and the news and commentary about it over the past two weeks (starting before the invasion) have been driving me crazy. Reading news reports and scrolling through social media has been especially disquieting to me. I know not everything I see is true. A lot of it is likely to be propaganda from one side of the conflict or the other. The internet is the best disinformation vehicle the world has ever created, and it is not only being used by Russia, it’s being used by Ukraine and everyone else, too. Ukraine may not be doing as well in this war as some of the video clips I have seen would lead me to believe.</p>\n<p>Ukrainians are fighting a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_war_theory\">just war</a> against an invading force, which makes taking sides in the conflict morally simple. Ukraine clearly does not deserve Putin’s incursion, and has put up a brave and savvy fight so far against it. It is easy to get caught up in how exciting and seemingly effective their defiance is, and to cheer them on in their defense of their democracy. But war is not an action movie.

				"content_text": "My little corner of Micro.blog has not had much to say about the invasion of Ukraine. This is probably a good thing, because it provides me a respite from grim news and unsubstantiated reports from the front lines. If I still had a Twitter timeline to scroll through, I’m certain that it would be full of performative, meaningless platitudes[^1], and strident back-and-forth arguments from people who (like me) have no bearing on the outcome of the conflict about what should be done about it.\n\nAll I can say right now is that the war is very upsetting to me and the news and commentary about it over the past two weeks (starting before the invasion) have been driving me crazy. Reading news reports and scrolling through social media has been especially disquieting to me. I know not everything I see is true. A lot of it is likely to be propaganda from one side of the conflict or the other. The internet is the best disinformation vehicle the world has ever created, and it is not only being used by Russia, it’s being used by Ukraine and everyone else, too. Ukraine may not be doing as well in this war as some of the video clips I have seen would lead me to believe. \n\nUkrainians are fighting a [just war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_war_theory) against an invading force, which makes taking sides in the conflict morally simple. Ukraine clearly does not deserve Putin’s incursion, and has put up a brave and savvy fight so far against it. It is easy to get caught up in how exciting and seemingly effective their defiance is, and to cheer them on in their defense of their democracy. But war is not an action movie. That it started already makes it a tragedy, and no matter the outcome it will end as an even greater one. The scrappy, virtuous underdogs may lose the fight. Their allies’ aide may be insufficient. Their charismatic leader may be killed. The two sides may broker a peace after heavy losses, and leave nothing meaningful resolved. Whatever the outcome is, I think we are all the worse for it.\n\n[^1]:\tYou may think this post is one. It is my personal reflection on the news, not a statement that I think is meaningful to anyone else or will advance a specific cause.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Recently, I converted all of my (very old) academic writing from outdated document formats (WordStar and Microsoft Word 6) to more future-proof formats: either <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">Markdown</a> or <a href=\"https://opendocumentformat.org\">OpenDocument</a> format (.odt). While I did not re-read every essay I ever wrote for school during this process, I did notice something in my files that surprised me: From my junior year of high school to my final semester of grad school, I created outlines—full <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)\">sentence outlines</a><sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>—for all of my papers that were over a few pages in length. I had forgotten that I used that type of outline for more than two important projects in my academic career: my first English thesis project and my last.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-first-english-thesis-project-wherein-i-learned-about-the-sentence-outline\">My first English thesis project, wherein I learned about the sentence outline</h2>\n<p>I was first taught (i.e., forced to use) a sentence outline in high school. It was a requirement of my grade 10 English thesis project, which was a 10-page research and literary criticism paper. At the time, I understood how to create high-level outlines pretty well, but could not understand why I would create an outline that contained full sentences of the essay I was trying to write. I figured that if I could write a sentence outline for an essay, I could just as easily (or more easily) write the essay itself. In grade 10, that is precisely what I did: I wrote the essay and then split apart every paragraph and every sentence into a hierarchical outline. In doing so, I learned almost nothing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-last-english-thesis-project-wherein-i-mastered-the-sentence-outline\">My last English thesis project, wherein I mastered the sentence outline</h2>\n<p>For my final English thesis project, my senior honors thesis in English at Brandeis University, I resorted to a sentence outline to solve my writer’s block. It was a year-long, independent study project, and my thesis advisor—who mostly told me that despite my anxiety I was doing fine—was not terribly helpful or available. Understandably, I lacked direction. I had no idea how to write a big, scary, and academically significant 80-100 page essay. When I sat down to write, I would either produce a jumbled mess of thoughts and quotations that did not fit together, or I would compose a coherent paragraph that I could not connect to anything else I wrote. As my senior year went by, I felt as if I was falling further and further behind my brilliant, thesis-writing peers. Counterintuitively (or understandably, depending on how you look at it), this feeling of dread led me to procrastinate instead of write.</p>\n<p>In the early spring, I realized that if I created an outline, I could work on my big, scary thesis essay without actually writing it. To that end, I split the work that had been going nowhere into two Word documents: (1) a simple, high-level outline that consisted of just a few headings at the start; and (2) an unorganized junk drawer of ideas and quotations from my source material. Outlining quickly became a productive form of procrastination for me. Instead of writing my essay, I would pluck out ideas from my junk-drawer document and drop them into the outline. From there, I would change these ideas, move them around, flesh them out, add to them, or delete them, all without committing to their precise wording or location. Because these ideas were all sentences or block quotes, my outline necessarily became a sentence outline.</p>\n<p>Using keyboard shortcuts I no longer remember, I collapsed sections and paragraphs of my thesis outline and moved them up and down to organize my ideas, and I shifted individual sentences up and down to make my arguments clearer and easier to understand. Because I was avoiding the writing phase of my project, I avoided gluing my sentences together with logical-, narrative-, or stylistic flow until I felt sure they were in the right place in the document and in the right order in their paragraph. Doing so took some time to get used to, but granted me a feeling of tremendous freedom as I worked out the essay’s high-level structure and the fleshed out the arguments I was advancing within it.</p>\n<p>I didn’t realize until I was finalizing my thesis—when my outline was a 100-page outline full of section headings, topic sentences, and body sentences organized into paragraph-level nodes—that I was doing <em>exactly</em> what I was supposed to do.

Unfortunately, my explanation of the rower’s story stretched to two whole paragraphs, making my essay far longer than the one-page limit. At that time in my life, I had no idea how to pare down my writing even if it meant cutting parts of it I liked. I agonized over how to cut it down, but decided, uneasily, to turn it in as it was, despite it exceeding the one-page limit.</p>\n<p>Happily, my overlong essay was a big success. I may have I understood the story of the rower better than even the teacher did, because the day after I turned it in he began the class but projecting my essay—all two pages of it—onto the classroom’s pull-down screen, and asking the whole class to read it. He seemed genuinely touched by it, too.</p>\n<p>This evening I pulled the essay out of my archives to reproduce below. The last two paragraphs are about the rower.

The life of a writer can be dark and lonely, demanding much introspection and many late nights alone with an unruly manuscript. The writing process itself is difficult beyond most people&rsquo;s conceptions. It is so harrowing, so haphazard, and so time consuming that most people that have one burning idea for a particular novel or story are never able to actually follow through its capitalization. Most never really even start, and the few who do often form such an attachment to their work, because it was so hard for them to accomplish, they will not allow themselves to alter it in any way, even to tie up loose ends or discard the beginnings of dropped themes and plot turns. Thus, their piece is never perfected; their dream is left to waste. Despite all these trials, however, writing is a very rewarding activity. Writing is like a passion eating at you, an aching, a hunger that can kill if not satiated. Only persistence, slogging through the murk and endless toil of the process, will enable one to fulfill his dream.</p>\n<p>A dominant tone of the work can be described as enthusiastic. Dillard is intense as she explains the writing process. She describes writing in exhilarating terms, comparing it to playing tennis, lion taming, and stunt flying. Her metaphors are powerful, zesty. She shows your work as a line of words pulsing through your bloodstream and shooting across the universe. She tells us committing a vision to paper is a futile fight with the jealous, tyrannical page, the forces of time and matter working against you. Her chapters are choppy, broken down into many vignettes and tiny observations. There is a break on almost every page. They are so frequent each seems to be a gasp of breath between her quickly blurted images.</p>\n<p>A strong scene that feels as though it will provide a good doorway for thoughtful attention to an important aspect of the work is the story of Ferrar Burn, which her painter friend, Paul Glenn, told her. One evening, years ago, Ferrar Burn caught sight of an eight-foot log of Alaska cedar floating out in the channel by his house. It was high tide, the water slack, so he rowed out, tied the log to his little eight-foot pram, and proceeded to tow it in. The tide turned, however, catching him, pulling him farther and farther out to sea. But Burn kept rowing against the tide, stubbornly, obstinately towards his house. He strained against it all night to little avail. When the tide finally changed the next morning, it finally pushed the still-rowing Ferrar Burn back home.</p>\n<p>This scene connects very well to the aforementioned theme. Through persistence against terrible odds, the rower Burn was finally able to succeed. Had he given up, stopped rowing, he would have drifted so far out to sea that the tide change which eventually pulled him back in would not have helped him. A writer too must pull against opposing forces to accomplish his or her goal. There is much about the process that pushes people away. Most would just assume go along with the tide, take the easy route, and be led far away from their dream. But the few with the dogged insistence to stick with their craft, pull through their troubles, and never lose sight of their objectives are able to ride out the tough times and sail swiftly and smoothly through the good times.

The rest of web3 is just another name for smart contracts, which—as far as I can tell—are an interesting idea that has not caught on very well in real-world applications.\n\nPerhaps the scope of both my research and my imagination is too narrow, but I don’t think web3 is going anywhere outside the venture capital community, at least not for a very long time.\n\n",

I cooked a big dinner tonight, using an Omaha Steaks package my mom bought us, invited my in-laws over the share it with us, and we had a very nice time.

				"content_text": "My feelings about Christmas are *complicated*. There are numerous legitimate reasons why, which I won’t go into. But they are there, and they have left me feeling and seeming like a villain in a Christmas movie. I don’t love Christmas (any more). I have heard enough carols. I have seen too many Santa Clauses. I don’t care much for Christmas trees, or elves, or angels. The lights and decorations overwhelm, rather than delight me. I am not proud of this disdain. I disappoints me that I ended up this way.\n\nStill, I have made an effort for today and tomorrow—the second “COVID-ruined” Christmas without travel to the actual Christmas-celebrating side of our family—to be nice for my family. I cooked a big dinner tonight, using an Omaha Steaks package my mom bought us, invited my in-laws over the share it with us, and we had a very nice time.

I said I thought she had a flat tire (it turns out she did), and I told her to park in the nearest parking lot and wait for me to get her.

Of course, stopping abruptly caused every loose thing in my car, including my daughter’s favorite doll, to fly forward and crash into the my arm, the center console, and even the dashboard.</p>\n<p>When we finally got to my wife and son, I saw a completely deflated rear passenger-side tire on her car.

I was locked out of my house. Out of sheer coincidence, at that exact moment, my in-laws drove up my driveway.

I started looking for my AirPods in crazy places throughout my house where they never could be: inside the refrigerator, inside various drawers and cabinets, and on the floor between my desk and the wall.\n\nI almost ordered new ones from Amazon, just to make the problem go away. The generation 2 AirPods were at an all-time low price today, but they wouldn’t be delivered until sometime in January, so it didn’t seem worth it. But, I saw that the new generation 3 AirPods could be delivered tomorrow. They just cost about $100 more. I almost bought them, but stopped short because I had to go back to work.\n\nAt long last, in the middle of the afternoon, when I decided to prepare a load of towels for the wash, I found them hiding at the bottom of the towel hamper. I have no idea how they fell in there, but I was enormously relieved to get them back.\n\nIt’s so silly, isn’t it?\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>A real “rebuilding year” is when a sports team is broken down and reassembled, basically from scratch, after—and as a response to—a dreadful season. 2020 was a dreadful season for, well, everyone on earth due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It certainly was for me. I experienced some deep trauma back in 2018 when my father died, which I thought went away after a few months, but never really did. Watching my father die (of Alzheimers and old age) completely messed me up. The emerging pandemic in early 2020 let the lingering feelings I had from that time metastasize into full-blown depression and anxiety. Work and home life were both stressful to me all the time. My relationships with everybody suffered. I was a wreck. So was everyone else at the time, which blinded me to how much of a mess I was. At some point, my eyes slowly opened to what was really going on with me, mental-health wise. My problem was that once I realized that my brain wasn’t working right (as in, rationally), I could not trust any of my thoughts, even the ones that could lead me to getting better. It took me months to figure out how to get help, even though, in hindsight, it wasn’t really that hard. By the end of 2020, I was well on the way to recovering from my mental health problems, but I hadn’t rebuilt my life yet.</p>\n<p>2021 has been a rebuilding year for me, pretty much from its first day. I made it a point to reach out to people. At work, I set up one-on-one meetings with everybody in my department, and asked for coaching sessions from people higher than me in the organization. At home, I made efforts to listen and to be more present in my relationships with my family members. Internally, I tried to be less hard on myself. I gave up some activities that were productive but stressful. I decided to write a blog entry every day. I allowed myself to waste time on mindless fun, like just listening to music or playing video games, after the kids were in bed (or supposed to be in bed, at least). I had thought that I would get the COVID vaccine and society would get back to normal. Of course, that hasn’t quite happened yet, but I am optimistic that next year will be the time when masking and social distancing pretty much go away. (I’m aware that a lot of people don’t wear masks when they go out, but my wife and kids wear masks at school for hours and hours each day, so masking and social distancing are very much going strong for my family.)</p>\n<p>Over the course of this rebuilding year, I have re-learned what I love to do, which I had forgotten over the past few years: Break complex things down to make them understandable; ask big, deep (or maybe dumb) questions; and to communicate ideas, especially in writing.</p>\n<p>I am both doing less than I used to and doing more. I am programming less and writing more. I made it a point to improve my presentation skills, and I did that. I taught myself how to make better slides, even though it was very challenging at first, and how to rehearse and revise a talk until it is brisk and concise. I have given …five or more presentations at work this year, on department-level and company-level Webex calls. I created a slide deck for our managing partner to present to the board of directors. I am getting more well known for my technical skills and presentation skills at work, too, which makes me feel great about my job for the first time in years. I also made it a point to write an article for my company’s newsletter, and I am about 85% done with that now, and plan to wrap it up next week.

I find it hard, especially during conference calls or WebEx meetings, to know who should talk when a question is thrown out to all attendees at once. Sometimes I start talking at the same time someone else does, and I think we both feel embarrassed about it.\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>One thing I certainly do not believe in is the divine right of kings. When considering why this is, I originally thought it was because I am American, and come from a country whose founders rejected the monarchy. But that can’t be it. Americans <em>love</em> monarchies, especially the British one. I realized that my feelings about it go deeper, and distract from my enjoyment of the fairy tale movies and stories my kids consume, which very frequently include princes and princesses whose right to wealth and power is never questioned.</p>\n<p>People can accrue power in various ways: being strong, wise, skillful, or charismatic are just a few. However, I think that there is limit to how much power these positive traits would give a person. They could lead a clan, but not a kingdom. To exert power over a kingdom requires ruthlessness, egoism, and violence.</p>\n<p>I believe that, at the dawn of history and before, ancient kings and pharaohs accrued their power over others through conquest. They didn’t earn their land. They took it. They didn’t earn their wealth. They stole it. They didn’t earn the subservience of their followers. They forced it.</p>\n<p>This line of thought leads me to believe that all modern nations could trace themselves back to powerful people who stole their wealth from others.

				"content_text": "One thing I certainly do not believe in is the divine right of kings. When considering why this is, I originally thought it was because I am American, and come from a country whose founders rejected the monarchy. But that can’t be it. Americans *love* monarchies, especially the British one. I realized that my feelings about it go deeper, and distract from my enjoyment of the fairy tale movies and stories my kids consume, which very frequently include princes and princesses whose right to wealth and power is never questioned.\n\nPeople can accrue power in various ways: being strong, wise, skillful, or charismatic are just a few. However, I think that there is limit to how much power these positive traits would give a person. They could lead a clan, but not a kingdom. To exert power over a kingdom requires ruthlessness, egoism, and violence.\n\nI believe that, at the dawn of history and before, ancient kings and pharaohs accrued their power over others through conquest. They didn’t earn their land. They took it. They didn’t earn their wealth. They stole it. They didn’t earn the subservience of their followers. They forced it.\n\nThis line of thought leads me to believe that all modern nations could trace themselves back to powerful people who stole their wealth from others. Furthermore, they used their power to invent religions and rules of thumb—such as hereditary monarchy and the divine right of kings—to justify and perpetuate their position at the top of society.\n\nTo this day, these ideas still have appeal and currency. We don’t question them, even those of us who live in democratic republics. To believe someone is a prince, you have to believe in princes.\n\nI don’t believe in princes anymore.

I presented on InsurTech several times before, dating all the way back to 2017. This time is different, however, because I have leveled up my presentation skills. I am excited to get the chance to present again, and am embracing the opportunity to find something new to say about technology, insurance, and investments.\n\nThis year I have been presenting so much more than I ever have before.

These things didn’t teach me anything, or give me any insights I didn’t already had. Instead they leached me of energy.\n\nNow, when I read an article or listen to a podcast that I know, going in will make me upset, or sad, or depressed, and inevitably *does* make me upset, or sad, or depressed, I find myself asking myself, automatically, “Why did I let that *in*?” The emphasis in my internal self-admonishment has recently moved from *that* to *in*, and I don’t really know why. I suppose that I have conceded to myself that I cannot avoid the daily torrent of news, gossip, hot takes, and both-sides-isms that pervades the internet. Even if I did avoid them myself, my family members bring them to me eventually, because we are all tapped into it. The trick I want to learn is to be able to observe all the frightful noise of each day’s media storm, but not dwell on it and let it bother me. Whether it bounces off me or passes through me, I don’t want to let it in anymore.\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>My daughter learned about slavery and the Civil War today in school. We talked about both—mostly slavery—over dinner. Needless to say, it was a heavy conversation—the first of many about race, racism, and the cracks in the foundation of our country. My daughter was, rightly, very shaken up about what we told her.</p>\n<p>It made me think of when I first learned about slavery in detail, when I was in high school. I had two American history teachers who covered slavery. One taught us that slavery was wrong, but also taught us that slaves were <em>not</em> beaten and tortured like popular culture had taught us, because—and this is <em>gross</em>—slaves were expensive and slaveowners wouldn’t want to destroy their investment in them. He would have us believe that most slaves were treated fairly well for economic reasons. I don’t think my teacher was a racist, but he drank the racist Kool-Aid: The Lost Cause apologists’ dismissal, “Sure, slavery was bad, but that was in the past. We fixed it. It wasn’t even that bad if you really think about it. Anyway, it’s over now. We don’t have to feel bad about it anymore.”</p>\n<p>I remember discussing slavery in his class in the context of moral relativism. (Moral realism was a huge school of thought in the nineties.) We debated how to judge people, like the Founding Fathers, who expressed high ideals about the dignity of humanity while, at the same time, they owned slaves. Is it fair to judge historical figures by today’s standards? These are important discussions to have in a history class. Back then I wanted to believe that these historical figures should be judged only by the standards of their time, both because I wanted them to remain my heroes, and because it seemed unfair to hold them to a standard that they might not have been even aware of.</p>\n<p>My other American history teacher stated to the class that slavery is morally wrong, across all time and across all cultures. He minced no words about it: there is no moral relativism when it came to slavery. It’s always wrong to subjugate others. Some things are simply <em>verboten</em>; it doesn’t matter what the society accepts or believes, or what the reasons are behind it. Even if we believe that most slaves were not subjected to frequent physical violence, as the other history teacher claimed, and even if we somehow believe slaver were treated very well, it does not forgive their subjugation, for that is psychological torture and is simply wrong. It doesn’t matter even if society deems such a thing acceptable; people should know innately that certain things are wrong.</p>\n<p>His simple lesson was the one that stuck with me. It has colored my thoughts about justice ever since. Moral relativism has certain clear limits. From him I learned that we could judge historical figures by their standards <em>and</em> our own.

To understand them, you have to scrutinize them fully as humans, warts and all.</p>\n<p>My parents never talked cogently to me about race when I was growing up. I picked up what they, and everyone else, thought about race slowly and organically. It didn’t help that I grew up in a preponderously white and Catholic area of Connecticut.

Half of my day was spent on actual work, even though I spent almost the entire day with my team, doing the same things they were doing. When I worked from home on that job, I got a lot more done, even though I would take break to make my coffee or put a load of laundry in the washing machine.</p>\n<p>My job today is different than any of the office-based ones. It is more fluid and unpredictable in nature; every day is different than the last, and some of my projects are vastly different from others. The sands are always shifting beneath my feet. I would prefer my job to be more predictable, for my mental health, more than anything.

I always imagine that my coworkers are more focused on their tasks than I am, or more driven to earn a promotion, or more highly structured in their approach to managing their work than I am.\n\nI’m pretty sure, though, that that *can’t* be, because no one I have ever worked with in person was much more focused that I was, with the exception of one or two workaholic bosses I’ve had. *Those* guys loved their job in ways I couldn’t replicate—at least that’s what I thought—and that drove them to work well into the evenings every day, after I was ready to go home.\n\nMy last office-job experience was mostly great, but there was a lot of gossip, walking around, waiting for elevators, waiting for meetings to begin, going out to grab a coffee, and so on. Half of my day was spent on actual work, even though I spent almost the entire day with my team, doing the same things they were doing. When I worked from home on that job, I got a lot more done, even though I would take break to make my coffee or put a load of laundry in the washing machine.\n\nMy job today is different than any of the office-based ones. It is more fluid and unpredictable in nature; every day is different than the last, and some of my projects are vastly different from others. The sands are always shifting beneath my feet. I would prefer my job to be more predictable, for my mental health, more than anything. I think that it is probably anxiety more than anything else that makes me think, pretty frequently, that I’m not working hard enough, or as hard as my peers, or that it took me too much time to do a certain task I was asked to do. \n\n\n",

I haven’t played a game in that genre since I was a kid, and as an adult I am terrible at a lot of the games I used to excel at (I’m looking at you, Mario!) so I was not sure if I could button-mash fast enough to play such games. $25 or more is too much to spend on a game that is too hard for me to play. While I dithered about a purchase, I spent some time playing NES versions of the <em>Double Dragon</em> games and <em>River City Ransom</em>, but found those games are too primitive to be much fun for me anymore.</p>\n<p>The Scott Pilgrim game was on sale for a stupidly low price ($7.49 or something), so I picked it up. To my surprise and delight, it is awesome. It has a colorful pixel art style that mimics the Scott Pilgrim comics. Its level design, character design, and animations show a lot of humor and attention to the source material. The chiptune soundtrack is really catchy. Play controls are easy to pick up. It starts out really hard, but you can replay levels to level up your character (i.e., lean new moves), and earn money to upgrade your character’s stats (strength, defense, etc.), which makes the game easier. It is kind of grind-y, at least for a conservative, low-skilled player like me, but the grind is fun.</p>\n<p>Basically, everything about the video game does justice to the source material. Playing it caused me to want to reread the graphic novels, which I started to do yesterday. <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>, in comics form, is weird, surreal, and a real mess—you know, a perfect reflection of the early twenties and late teens lives of its characters. The characters, plot, and themes of the book, are complex, messy, flawed, and not fully formed. Nobody is a role model. Nobody is mature. Reality itself is warped for them. It makes no sense that Scott goes into video game mode and <em>kills</em> his girlfriend’s exes. Is that a metaphor? Only kind of. You’re just not expected to take it seriously. It’s <em>all</em> problematic—like life, I guess. I don’t really think it is deep (maybe you would if you were much younger than me), but it is really good at stirring up complicated thoughts and emotions in me about how messy life is. During this re-read, I have thought about how I might judge people who haven’t figured their lives out yet, or overlook the good qualities in someone like that.

I basically know where all the keys are, but my typing is laborious and slow. I have to think very hard to type every word. At my best right now, I make a plan for the word I will type next, then try to execute that plan without making too many errors. At worst, I look down at the keyboard and hunt and peck.\n\nI remember when learning QWERTY that, after learning where all the letters were, I started to memorize certain patterns to type particular words or parts of words. In other words, I [chunked](https://www.betterhelp.com/advice/psychologists/what-is-chunking-psychology-definition-and-applications/) it. Typing fast was a matter of stringing along series of predefined multi-key movements which acted like mental macros.\n\nI see myself at the very beginning of the chunking process right now. It will take a lot more practice to get fast, but I plan to stick with it; hopefully it will be worth it in the long run. If I can type more efficiently I believe I will incur less RSI going forward. That is my main goal in switching keyboards and layouts.\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>To err is human. To forgive, divine. But to have a good chance to detect and correct mistakes, you need controls. That’s what I have learned in my audit career.</p>\n<p>A control helps you understand if a transaction or business process completed completely, correctly, and timely. It is designed to answer the auditor’s most probing question: “How do you know?”</p>\n<p>The term itself is jargon, and isn’t widely understood outside of accounting, finance, audit, and compliance circles—unless you are pulled into an audit of some kind as a subject matter expert. One of my bosses used to say all the time, as a joking impersonation of management, “What is a control?” (It would be silly to say that joke <em>killed</em>, but we all got it.)</p>\n<p>Of course “control” has a slightly different meaning in everyday language. I think most people want control over their lives: freedom, autonomy, and independence; and also, somewhat paradoxically, stability and predictability. As societal norms and expectations shift, and political, environmental and economic pressures escalate, the present feels more and more uncertain over time—it is literally out of control. As a counterweight to that, a lot of people long for strong leaders who promise to exert control by force of will, or just by force—in other words, authoritarian control.</p>\n<p>The problem is that all leaders, both good and bad, know that it is easier to assert that things are correct rather than to actually correct them. In the business world, the same kind of situation applies. An executive can say that a company is doing everything it can in certain areas, but without controls and transparency, there is no way to know if such a statement is true.</p>\n<p>On an individual basis, we can’t control everything that happens in our lives. What we can do, however, on an everyday personal level, is to implement the controls (in the audit sense) over what we do and the decisions we make.

That’s what I have learned in my audit career. \n\nA control helps you understand if a transaction or business process completed completely, correctly, and timely. It is designed to answer the auditor’s most probing question: “How do you know?”\n\nThe term itself is jargon, and isn’t widely understood outside of accounting, finance, audit, and compliance circles—unless you are pulled into an audit of some kind as a subject matter expert. One of my bosses used to say all the time, as a joking impersonation of management, “What is a control?” (It would be silly to say that joke *killed*, but we all got it.)\n\nOf course “control” has a slightly different meaning in everyday language. I think most people want control over their lives: freedom, autonomy, and independence; and also, somewhat paradoxically, stability and predictability. As societal norms and expectations shift, and political, environmental and economic pressures escalate, the present feels more and more uncertain over time—it is literally out of control. As a counterweight to that, a lot of people long for strong leaders who promise to exert control by force of will, or just by force—in other words, authoritarian control. \n\nThe problem is that all leaders, both good and bad, know that it is easier to assert that things are correct rather than to actually correct them. In the business world, the same kind of situation applies. An executive can say that a company is doing everything it can in certain areas, but without controls and transparency, there is no way to know if such a statement is true. \n\nOn an individual basis, we can’t control everything that happens in our lives. What we can do, however, on an everyday personal level, is to implement the controls (in the audit sense) over what we do and the decisions we make. These can be gaurdrails and double-checks as simple as The Golden Rule and Measure Twice, Cut Once. Just ask yourself sometimes: How do you know if what you’re doing is right?\n\n",

We had to move out of our old house three months before our new house was finished being built. We ended up as the only tenants in an apartment complex across town from where we used to live. For the fall, I went to my old elementary school and saw my old neighborhood friends and familiar classmates during the day, but I saw no one my age outside of school during the week or on weekends. Besides my parents, I saw <em>no one</em> on nights and weekends.</p>\n<p>As an only child, I could keep my own company. I watched a lot of TV that fall. I played a lot of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.\">Super Mario Brothers</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Hunt\">Duck Hunt</a>. By Christmas, I was so bored that I actually mastered playing Gyromite with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.O.B.\">R.O.B. the Robot</a>, which is a game that is both preposterously difficult (I mean, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ocrTkuPMmvI\">look at this</a>) and equally unrewarding.</p>\n<p>On New Year’s Day we moved into our new house, which was newly built in in a new, single-road housing development that was not yet completed. The house was both awesome—so big! so new!—and lonely. It inhabited the unfinished end of the street; half our neighbors were empty lots. We didn’t have streetlights or mailboxes. Our front yard had no trees, no grass, and no bushes; it was a sea of straw, strewn over frozen mud. My best friend for the first week was the little TV in my room that I watched while my parents unpacked their things.</p>\n<p>Starting over at school, and making what friends I could in my new, very small neighborhood—especially after months of social isolation—was tough. I would ask my parents how to make new friends in my new town, where the kids all dressed differently, talked differently, and cared about different things than the kids I was friends with in my prior life. How do you start talking to someone you don’t know without coming across like an idiot?</p>\n<p>They would say, wisely, “just be yourself.” That was pretty much the only advice I ever got growing up about how to act, how to fit in, and how to be comfortable in new social situations. It is <em>terrible</em> advice.</p>\n<p>When I moved to a new town, I didn’t need to “be myself.” I needed to <em>change</em> myself: to become someone flexible enough to adapt to my new situation, to meet new people halfway, to be more open to taking chances, and to care less about every moment that didn’t go so well. It took me a long time to figure that out, but I did. I adjusted. I made friends. I found my people. It took a long time, and over that time I changed myself into a person far more comfortable with who I was and who I wasn’t.</p>\n<p>“Just be yourself” doesn’t mean “just be yourself.” It means <em>don’t hate yourself</em>. Truly. For every inch of “don’t change yourself to fit in” in those words, there is a mile of “put yourself out there, and don’t let yourself feel destroyed if it doesn’t work out.” Try, and try again, but don’t hate yourself when you fail to make a connection or have to put your foot in your mouth. Don’t hate yourself when you don’t measure up, don’t fit in, and don’t succeed.</p>\n<p>So, when you face a new challenge in life, don’t be yourself. Be better.</p>\n",

By Christmas, I was so bored that I actually mastered playing Gyromite with [R.O.B. the Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.O.B.), which is a game that is both preposterously difficult (I mean, [look at this](https://youtu.be/ocrTkuPMmvI)) and equally unrewarding. \n\nOn New Year’s Day we moved into our new house, which was newly built in in a new, single-road housing development that was not yet completed. The house was both awesome—so big! so new!—and lonely. It inhabited the unfinished end of the street; half our neighbors were empty lots. We didn’t have streetlights or mailboxes. Our front yard had no trees, no grass, and no bushes; it was a sea of straw, strewn over frozen mud. My best friend for the first week was the little TV in my room that I watched while my parents unpacked their things.\n\nStarting over at school, and making what friends I could in my new, very small neighborhood—especially after months of social isolation—was tough. I would ask my parents how to make new friends in my new town, where the kids all dressed differently, talked differently, and cared about different things than the kids I was friends with in my prior life. How do you start talking to someone you don’t know without coming across like an idiot? \n\nThey would say, wisely, “just be yourself.” That was pretty much the only advice I ever got growing up about how to act, how to fit in, and how to be comfortable in new social situations. It is *terrible* advice.\n\nWhen I moved to a new town, I didn’t need to “be myself.” I needed to *change* myself: to become someone flexible enough to adapt to my new situation, to meet new people halfway, to be more open to taking chances, and to care less about every moment that didn’t go so well. It took me a long time to figure that out, but I did. I adjusted. I made friends. I found my people. It took a long time, and over that time I changed myself into a person far more comfortable with who I was and who I wasn’t.\n\n“Just be yourself” doesn’t mean “just be yourself.” It means *don’t hate yourself*. Truly. For every inch of “don’t change yourself to fit in” in those words, there is a mile of “put yourself out there, and don’t let yourself feel destroyed if it doesn’t work out.” Try, and try again, but don’t hate yourself when you fail to make a connection or have to put your foot in your mouth. Don’t hate yourself when you don’t measure up, don’t fit in, and don’t succeed. \n\nSo, when you face a new challenge in life, don’t be yourself. Be better.\n\n",

I <em>am</em> a nice person, just not <em>as</em> nice as my wife is.</p>\n<p>I’m not <em>as</em> nice because I was bullied for most of my childhood. I never got beaten up (though I did get into fights), and I was never afraid to go to school (though it was a gauntlet and a crucible), but I was picked on mercilessly, incessantly, and for <em>everything</em>—my name, my weight, my glasses, and most of all for being smart.</p>\n<p>When I was a young adult, I would say that the bullying led me to develop <em>character</em>—and, man, I wish I didn’t have character! As a middle-aged adult, I find myself wondering what that bullying really taught me. I think, in a huge way, it taught me to distrust people—especially people my own age. It taught me not to take what people said to me at face value, because venomous words are often preceded by honeyed ones. It taught me that others may switch from allies to enemies when the social situation changes, like when the bullies enter the scene.</p>\n<p>One of my triumphs in life was when I finally made the bullying stop. After years of trying different things—there is a lot of well-meaning advice for the bullied out there to follow—what finally made the bullying stop was a 30-second conversation I had with one of my bullies, in the back of a classroom on the first day of seventh grade.

				"content_text": "I often joke with people that I am not as nice as my wife is. It’s a self-deprecating remark, but I do mean it. I *am* a nice person, just not *as* nice as my wife is.\n\nI’m not *as* nice because I was bullied for most of my childhood. I never got beaten up (though I did get into fights), and I was never afraid to go to school (though it was a gauntlet and a crucible), but I was picked on mercilessly, incessantly, and for *everything*—my name, my weight, my glasses, and most of all for being smart.\n\nWhen I was a young adult, I would say that the bullying led me to develop *character*—and, man, I wish I didn’t have character! As a middle-aged adult, I find myself wondering what that bullying really taught me. I think, in a huge way, it taught me to distrust people—especially people my own age. It taught me not to take what people said to me at face value, because venomous words are often preceded by honeyed ones. It taught me that others may switch from allies to enemies when the social situation changes, like when the bullies enter the scene.\n\nOne of my triumphs in life was when I finally made the bullying stop. After years of trying different things—there is a lot of well-meaning advice for the bullied out there to follow—what finally made the bullying stop was a 30-second conversation I had with one of my bullies, in the back of a classroom on the first day of seventh grade. After being on the receiving end of some stupid taunt, I had had enough. I turned to the kid, looked him in the eye, and said to him: “You can say whatever you want to me.

It’s not perfect, and I really would like to create a more robust `Fn` (function key) layer, but I will live with it for now.\n\n",

The result, I think, will be more plain (and maybe more ugly) than the existing site, but it will be less janky on mobile devices.\n\nI sank a lot of time over the past week looking for a Hugo theme that is perfect for my needs, but I couldn’t find one. For the sake of achieving my simple goal of refreshing my tiny websites, I gave up the goal of visual perfection, and am driving forward with a theme that I think is OK that works well enough for me.\n\nFrom my perspective, I want my site to be easier to maintain and add content. That is more important to me than having a site that looks really slick. My old websites don’t look slick anymore, anyway: No one is fooled by outdated HTML templates into thinking that my very niche apps are developed by a huge, sophisticated software corporation.\n\n",

I figured that the Snyder cut must be better, but I was surprised at how much better it is. Granted, it still isn’t <em>good</em>. It doesn’t fix its pacing problems. It still is not as brisk and pleasurable as the best of the Marvel movies. It doesn’t tell a cohesive story, but it also crams in too many story lines for a non-DC fan to keep track of. It still has some dumb script problems, such every single part of the nonsensical museum height/terrorist bombing blot in the opening Wonder Woman scene, that could have been solved by editing a few sentences of dialog. While not exactly <em>good</em>, it is a good bad movie now. Its reach often exceeds its grasp, but it offers a lot of interesting material to people who are already fans. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to be the kind of movie that would bring a lot new fans in.</p>\n<p>It is now very clear to me that Zach Snyder’s vision was dark and wild and weird—definitely too much of all of those things to launch a successful franchise—but Joss Whedon’s contributions were just awful: tasteless, asinine, nonsensical, and insulting to the audience. Whedon’s dialog (notably Superman’s and The Flash’s) and the character moments he created, like the race between The Flash and Superman, are embarrassing to watch and make the characters seem stupid. Snyder’s cut simply had better dialog for them. Simply getting rid of the random <em>people</em> that Whedon put into that nuclear wasteland Russian city—the one that existed in the movie only to be destroyed in a bout of cinematic excess—made the climax bearable. Who needs to worry about a family who shouldn’t be living in a nuclear wasteland anyway when the entire world is already at stake? Whedon really did screw up that movie.</p>\n<p>I think that the Snyder Cut works very well for fans of the comics, especially fans of the “what-if” versions of all the famous characters. Some fans, like me, believe that comic book characters are archetypes, and really can be <em>anything</em>, and no representation of them is truly canonical. The grim, dark version of the Justice League is an interesting thought experiment, one of many worth exploring.

In America, for a couple weeks at least, it still seemed likely that the disease would never leave China, much like H1N1 and SARS never made a big impact here. For almost three months my mental state caromed between what I think of now as irrational fear and rational fear. I could see the whole year of 2020 play out in my imagination, way before my friends and family could see what was coming, but I could do nothing to stop it, and I could do almost nothing to protect my family from it. All those feelings felt very real and very debilitating, even when almost no one else around me was feeling them.</p>\n<p>I had about two months of angst about COVID before it actually hit around here. The last time I went out with friends and family was, I think, on March 14, 2020. We went to see a musical and when out to eat at a crowded restaurant afterward. It was really hard for me to feel comfortable the entire time, but I didn’t want to let everybody down because I was concerned about a pandemic that hadn’t hit our area yet. Less than a week later, my entire family was on lockdown.</p>\n<p>Back in January, February, and early March 2020, it didn’t help me at all to have known about the scope and length and shape of prior pandemics, like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu\">Spanish Flu</a>, which I know, from reading family letters, killed a bunch of people in my extended family about a hundred years ago. It didn’t help me at all to know what I should do and buy to prepare for it. It didn’t help me at all that I am smart enough to think for myself and to scrutinize, with a pretty good understanding of the relevant science and statistics, the information and advice experts were providing to us. All of these things just made me feel more uncertain and more cynical about what was going on.</p>\n<p>A year later, I am feeling more hopeful. I have the vaccine after all, and am probably (but not definitely) immune to COVID 18. But my <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/monmouth-new-jersey-covid-cases.html\">county is still at extremely high risk level</a>. The numbers are still higher than they were last year when all of us were in a panic. Despite that, all the states, even blue states like mine, are reopening rapidly and throwing caution to the wind, when it would be more prudent to do so more gradually. It makes me nervous that we are giving the virus a chance to circulate long enough to adapt resistance to our vaccines.</p>\n<p>I was early in being scared of COVID, and I may be late in getting over that fear. I just hope that, when I look forward from today, whatever fear I feel is merely anxiety over things that will not play out, rather than the accurate foresight into the future that I had late last winter.</p>\n",

Less than a week later, my entire family was on lockdown.\n\nBack in January, February, and early March 2020, it didn’t help me at all to have known about the scope and length and shape of prior pandemics, like the [Spanish Flu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu), which I know, from reading family letters, killed a bunch of people in my extended family about a hundred years ago. It didn’t help me at all to know what I should do and buy to prepare for it. It didn’t help me at all that I am smart enough to think for myself and to scrutinize, with a pretty good understanding of the relevant science and statistics, the information and advice experts were providing to us. All of these things just made me feel more uncertain and more cynical about what was going on.\n\nA year later, I am feeling more hopeful. I have the vaccine after all, and am probably (but not definitely) immune to COVID 18. But my [county is still at extremely high risk level](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/monmouth-new-jersey-covid-cases.html). The numbers are still higher than they were last year when all of us were in a panic. Despite that, all the states, even blue states like mine, are reopening rapidly and throwing caution to the wind, when it would be more prudent to do so more gradually. It makes me nervous that we are giving the virus a chance to circulate long enough to adapt resistance to our vaccines.\n\nI was early in being scared of COVID, and I may be late in getting over that fear. I just hope that, when I look forward from today, whatever fear I feel is merely anxiety over things that will not play out, rather than the accurate foresight into the future that I had late last winter.\n\n",

Being <em>able</em> to know this, like being able to discern the “tone at the top” as a new auditor, is a rare gift.

But some experts think that is only worsening the problem. “We see some evidence that there is specific targeting of organizations that have insurance,” said Kimberly Goody, a manager of financial crimes analysis for FireEye, a major cybersecurity firm, which says it has responded to twice as many ransomware attacks this year compared with 2018.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have two main observations about this section:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First, it is galling that the typical fix for ransomware attacks is to pay the ransom, and rely on the good faith of the bad actor who locked away all the data to actually restore the encrypted data. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Second, that attackers are targeting companies that have done the fiscally responsible thing and obtained cyberinsurance to mitigate their ransomware risks is a perverse form of <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_selection\">adverse selection</a>. I am sure the cyberinsurance industry is working out ways to incentivize their customers to reduce their ransomware risks, because that is what insurance companies do, but organizational inertia and lack of funding will make it difficult and time-consuming to succeed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ideally, companies and municipalities would keep their systems up to date through regular software packaging and hardware upgrades, and would inventory and back up their data, so that ransomware attacks would be less likely to succeed, and so that data could be restored without paying the ransom. Organizations could also reduce their attack surface in other ways, such as replacing Microsoft Windows with ChromeOS for classes of workers, such as call center workers, whose job functions do not require Microsoft Windows.

But now an even stricter version of low-carb eating called the ketogenic diet is gaining popular attention, igniting a fierce scientific debate about its potential risks and benefits.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I am grateful that ketogenic diets are being treated seriously enough to be written about in a national newspaper. Unfortunately, the New York Times is trying to <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teach_the_Controversy\">teach the controversy</a>, when no such controversy actually exists.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here are some clarifying points about some of the topics discussed or touched upon in the article, from someone who actually follows a sensible, low calorie, vegetable-rich ketogenic diet:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>There is no \"Keto diet\". There are a variety of <em>ketogenic</em> diets, all with the common element that they tend to put the body in a state of <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis\">nutritional ketosis</a> at some point (not all day long unless you fast; primarily while you are sleeping). All these diets involve restricting carbohydrate intake to very low levels, ranging from 0 g to about 50 g per day. They differ in meal composition, meal timing, and what foods are allowed or disallowed. Also, in real life, even people on ketogenic diets will eat a high-carbohydrate treat now and then.</li><li>Nutritional ketosis is not the same as <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoacidosis\">ketoacidosis</a>.</li><li>Ideally, ketogenic diets involve eating a great deal of high fiber (but low starch) vegetables. Imagine telling your doctor that you eat two huge salads per day, with four ounces of meat on them, one ounce of cheese, and a tablespoon or two of olive-oil-and-vinegar dressing. Doctors have told me that it is hard to eat healthier than that.</li><li>Ketogenic diets are\"high fat\", on a <em>percentage basis</em>, not necessarily on an absolute basis (as in, grams of fat per day). </li><li>Similarly, ketogenic diets are not necessarily higher in meat or dairy consumption that the standard American diet.</li><li>I have read many, many abstracts and articles about diet and nutrition studies. Almost every study I have come across demonstrates bias or lack of understanding of what ketogenic diets actually look like (they tend not to restrict carbohydrates in test subjects sufficiently), relies on bad data (epidemiological data, or prior studies' data, self-reported food logs), or have durations that are too short (you need more than a couple weeks to assess a diet change). </li><li>Sometimes the scientists' own conclusions do not seem to be drawn from from the data they collected. This often evidences itself when the study concludes that, despite outcomes being equal or better for ketogenic diets, there is concern about their heart health due to the amount of fat in their diet.</li><li>While you may believe there is insufficient evidence that ketogenic diets are healthy (whatever that means), there is ample evidence that the standard American diet (which I understand has spread to most of the world at this point) is obviously not. It it were, there wouldn't be an obesity epidemic.</li><li>I don't believe it makes sense to adopt an all-meat, or all-meat-and-cheese, diet. My reasoning: Fermentation of high-fiber vegetable matter in the gut is something humans evolved to do, and, for that reason, it is probably a good idea to continue doing so. I would understand if this argument were made more clearly in the article; instead some scientist’s statement that mistakes \"high fiber\" foods with high carbohydrate foods (i.e. <em>starchy</em> foods) is there, casting doubt about about the diet in a way that doesn’t make logical sense.</li><li>Ketogenic diets are not appropriate for some people, due to underlying medical conditions such as Type I Diabetes. This does not mean that that are not appropriate for anybody.</li><li>In the end, we are all <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_of_1_trial\">n = 1 studies</a>. It doesn't matter what the science says about a diet's effect on study participants or on populations, it matters how the diet affects <em>you</em>. Many, many people have success with ketogenic diets that they did not have with low-fat diets or with calorie counting. If low-fat dieting or calories-in-calories-out tracking works for someone, it makes no sense to disparage that person’s diet choices, and almost no one would. Ketogenic diets should be treated the same way.<br></li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All in all, the article is 80% of good content with 20% of nonsense thrown in for the sake of balance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

It takes great pictures, is incredibly versatile, and fits in a relatively tiny belt-loop holster case, so I can take it anywhere.

I bought my Mark I used for $300, right after the RX-100 Mark II was released.

It may be slower than a smartphone camera, and have fewer features than a more recent model, but it still takes great pictures, and is pretty easy to use as well.\n\n> The RX100 VII will be available later in August 2019 for $1,200 for the camera alone. Later in 2019, the aforementioned Shooting Grip Kit bundle will be available for $1,300. It will be available for preorder at B&H Photo and Adorama later today.\n\nIt's an over-$1,000 pocket camera, though, which is a market segment that sounds like it shouldn't even exist. I bought my Mark I used for $300, right after the RX-100 Mark II was released. Since then, owners have been more keen on selling their old ones for much higher prices, which has kept me from upgrading. Maybe someday I will pick up one from a few generations back.\n",

I have reached this conclusion based on the countless times I have found myself moving files from one place to another.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>My FreeNAS media server</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have run <a href=\"https://www.freenas.org\">FreeNAS</a> on a <a href=\"https://n40l.fandom.com/wiki/HP_MicroServer_N40L_Wiki\">HP N54L Microserver</a> for over five years. It has been a fantastic server. I bought it, a slightly used review unit, loaded with four 500 GB drives that it would not have normally come with, for a song—less than a new one with no storage drives included. Over the years, I updated the storage (now I have 16 TB total, with 8 TB usable space, set up in a single RAIDZ2 volume), and the RAM (from 8 GB to 16 GB). Over that same time period, 8 TB went from an impressive amount of storage to something a relatively inexpensive single drive could handle.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What those single drives don’t have, however, is redundancy and data integrity features. My little FreeNAS server has that, thanks to the ZFS file system. At several times in my home media streaming career, the external hard drive I used to store my media files died, and I lost all my data. Thankfully, no important personal data, like my photos, was ever lost, but the experience was upsetting enough not to want to repeat any more. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hard drive failures can happen to anyone, at any time, even if you have a nice server rather than a Raspberry Pi with an external hard drive attached via USB. Less than a year after I upgraded my FreeNAS server’s drives, one of them failed. The  FreeNAS server emailed me about the error, and its UI showed that my drive array was operating in a degraded state. I quickly ordered a new drive, swapped it out the next day, and never lost a bit of data. (I returned the failed drive for a free replacement, so now I have a replacement available, in case I ever need it.)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>File servers fill up, if you let them</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>FreeNAS has been stable, reliable, and a joy to use. One thing I have learned from running it, however, is that its file system, ZFS, degrades in performance when a volume (a pool of drives) is more than 80% full. FreeNAS will warn you about this threshold, but I never took it too seriously, because poor performance is mostly an academic concern when all you are doing with a server is transferring a few gigabytes a day. I do like to silence warnings, however, so I normally have to prune my media collection, or move some videos I want to keep, but am unlikely to watch again soon, to external, mostly cold, storage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course, where is that old, external drive with my files on it? I have no idea. So, this week, when my FreeNAS server filled up way over the 80% warning threshold, I decided, rather than continuing to free space by deleting movies and TV series that I didn’t want to delete, to add some more redundant storage to my network, and move the old files there. This decision was mostly based on having some extra hardware lying around, unused. I have a <a href=\"https://www.seagate.com/support/network-attached-storage/business-storage/seagate-nas/\">2 TB, two-bay Seagate NAS</a>, which is a little, Linux-based server with a consumer friendly web UI for administration. Unlike FreeNAS, it is very locked down, and unlike my HP microserver, it has only two drive bays rather than four.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At any rate, I set that up again and started moving some files to it, which sounds simpler than it really is. I am cherry picking files that are less likely to be accessed to the new server, so I have to go through everything I have, to some extent. Because the files either number in the thousands (like music files) or are multiple gigabytes in size (like video files), moving them has been very slow. Because the Seagate NAS’s filesystem (EXT4) is different than the FreeNAS filesystem (ZFS), there are other interesting problems, like file naming rules, that trip up file transfers. Because these are two different UNIX-like systems with different users configured on them, sometimes there are permissions issues that prevent files from being moved, renamed, or deleted. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As cool as it is to stream movies and music throughout my house, making it all work requires, from time to time, a lot of low-level file transfers. It has been taking a lot more time and attention than I would like.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was poking around my iTunes library, found an old album I loved from senior year of high school, by a local Connecticut band called Mr. Right. After some Google searches, I found a copy of a song that was one of my all-time, lost, never-had-it-on-a-proper-CD, never-could-get-it-anywhere songs: “<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/temporary/5980546?i=5980528\">Temporary</a>”. It wasn’t what I expected, however. It was a different arrangement, which was entirely unexpected.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I first heard “Temporary”, it was a power pop song, recorded by Mr. Right (or maybe just <a href=\"http://www.hartford.edu/hartt/about-us/faculty/music/music-industry/jim-chapdelaine.aspx\">Jim Chapdelaine</a>). Apparently, he dusted the song off almost ten years later to record with his new band, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/feathermerchants/featured\">Feathermerchants</a>, and reimagined it as a folk-rock (dare I say, Americana?) ballad, sung by a feather-light soprano. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I was seventeen, I recorded, with my high school band, an EP weeks before we all left for college. Due to dumb luck (one of our friends grew up next door to a bonafide music producer—and the knew each other), two of our four-song EP was recorded, mixed, and mastered by <a href=\"http://westhartfordmagazine.com/musician-husband-father-cancer-survivor/\">Jim Chapdelaine</a>, who went on to become a 13-time Emmy winner, among other amazing things. We first met up with him because his band at the time (in 1995), Mr. Right, played a gig at my hometown's annual fall festival on the green. My friends and I pretty much idolized him for a little while after high school graduation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jim played a recording of the original song through his board as we were waiting for something to happen—probably while we were waiting for our gold master CD to be written, at 1/2X speed, in Jim’s basement music studio. The chorus is an ear worm, and I really enjoy the lyric. I remembered it to this day, and hearing it made me feel nostalgic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

She loved everything about it, and got to touch a bunch of animals (sheet, goats, birds, snakes, lizards, an armadillo, a rabbit, and a chinchilla) that we never through she would touch.

I fixed a bug that made its call blocking extension not load for a lot of people.

I had thought the bug was related to the app’s Core Data stack, which I had no way to fix, but it turned out to be something different. It feels good to fix that bug, and hopefully put a stop to all the customer emails I get about it.</p>\n",

The current version is super old now, and I re-wrote it from scratch, basing the model code on the iOS version I have been working on for a couple years now. At this point, the new Mac version is even better than the iOS version, but it is still not ready for release. Based on the brief time I can work on it, late at night, I imagine I have several weeks to go before I can release it.\n\nAlso, today, I released a bug fix update to one of my other apps, <a href=\"https://simplecallblockerapp.com\">Simple Call Blocker</a>. I fixed a bug that made its call blocking extension not load for a lot of people. It turns out the problem had to do with calling an Apple API incorrectly—and I think the rules changed since I initially released the app, because it used to work without a problem. I had thought the bug was related to the app’s Core Data stack, which I had no way to fix, but it turned out to be something different. It feels good to fix that bug, and hopefully put a stop to all the customer emails I get about it.\n",

I used it as my primary email host for a short time, as it was a pretty inexpensive IMAP email host back in the days when getting IMAP support outside of college or corporate email systems was quite rare. I stopped using it because it would go down from time to time, which is frustrating. I now use it only to get status emails sent by my home server (FreeNAS), which are relatively unimportant and anonymous. I keep thinking about using it more, because I love pure IMAP email, but now I am glad I did not.</p>\n<p>I saw today that mail could not be fetched, and I found out that VFEmail was hacked, and everything for its US customers (including me, of course) has been destroyed. This is the message on the home page right now:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>!!!ALERT!!!! Update Feb 11 2019\n<a href=\"http://www.vfemail.net\">www.vfemail.net</a> and mail.vfemail.net are currently unavailable.\nWe have suffered catastrophic destruction at the hands of a hacker, last seen as <a href=\"mailto:aktv@94.155.49.9\">aktv@94.155.49.9</a>\nThis person has destroyed all data in the US, both primary and backup systems.

				"content_text": "\nIn 2001 I paid $14.99 for a lifetime account at [VFEmail](https://vfemail.net). I used it as my primary email host for a short time, as it was a pretty inexpensive IMAP email host back in the days when getting IMAP support outside of college or corporate email systems was quite rare. I stopped using it because it would go down from time to time, which is frustrating. I now use it only to get status emails sent by my home server (FreeNAS), which are relatively unimportant and anonymous. I keep thinking about using it more, because I love pure IMAP email, but now I am glad I did not.\n\nI saw today that mail could not be fetched, and I found out that VFEmail was hacked, and everything for its US customers (including me, of course) has been destroyed. This is the message on the home page right now:\n\n> !!!ALERT!!!! Update Feb 11 2019\n> www.vfemail.net and mail.vfemail.net are currently unavailable.\n> We have suffered catastrophic destruction at the hands of a hacker, last seen as aktv@94.155.49.9\n> This person has destroyed all data in the US, both primary and backup systems. We are working to recover what data we can.\n\nThat is just devastating.

I really hope not. I share his dream of solving traffic problems with underground mass-transit and personal-transit systems. We need more tunnels to route traffic away from (or at least beneath) city centers, and to open additional arteries into cities like New York City that are largely surrounded by, or bordered by, water.</p>\n<p>I lived through all the cost overruns in <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig\">The Big Dig</a> in Boston. There were major deficiencies in planning, lots of cutting corners in terms of materials, design, and engineering that came back to bite them, and simple graft and stupidity at play. I am not sure that The Boring Company can really put a huge dent into all those things. A lot of them are <em>not</em>  technical problems that engineers can solve.</p>\n<p>The Big Dig was a huge mess that was on our minds in Boston for years. The end result of that mess of a project, though, was a much nicer and more cohesive downtown Boston. This came about mostly by reclaiming land that had been used for highway overpasses, not because traffic and commute times were substantially reduced.</p>\n<p>I think that if Elon Musk and his Boring Company could somehow decrease the costs of building tunnels, it would be far more important than building <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop\">a new, sci-fi method of transportation</a>.

We need more tunnels to route traffic away from (or at least beneath) city centers, and to open additional arteries into cities like New York City that are largely surrounded by, or bordered by, water.\n\nI lived through all the cost overruns in [The Big Dig](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig) in Boston. There were major deficiencies in planning, lots of cutting corners in terms of materials, design, and engineering that came back to bite them, and simple graft and stupidity at play. I am not sure that The Boring Company can really put a huge dent into all those things. A lot of them are _not_  technical problems that engineers can solve.\n\nThe Big Dig was a huge mess that was on our minds in Boston for years. The end result of that mess of a project, though, was a much nicer and more cohesive downtown Boston. This came about mostly by reclaiming land that had been used for highway overpasses, not because traffic and commute times were substantially reduced. \n\nI think that if Elon Musk and his Boring Company could somehow decrease the costs of building tunnels, it would be far more important than building [a new, sci-fi method of transportation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop). I just don't think that he is actually doing it, even though he is telling everyone he is.\n",

				"content_text": "<h2>Files integration</h2>In late August I released a version of SwiftoDo that added sync support for any cloud data provider, via integration with the Files app. I think that this integration can be improved in the future. For example, right now, you cannot <em>create</em> a todo.txt file in the Files app using SwiftoDo, and you cannot open an existing todo.txt <em>from</em> the Files app.\n\nIf I add those features, I may as well rewrite the app’s UI, so that you have to create or open a file upon SwiftoDo’s launch. I would also have to rewrite how preferences are stored, so users could define different preferences for different files they open.\n\nThose changes would, I think, necessitate dropping the offline support features that currently exist—namely manual sync mode, and the failsafes in place for when automatic sync fails (typically due to network unavailability). I am actually not sure how other document-based apps on iOS handle things when network connectivity is lost or unavailable. I would assume they simply cannot work without a constant network connection, because they cannot access their file, but I am not sure.\n\nI do know that a task list is not a typical document-based app, like a text editor. Users typically want it to be always available, rather than dependent on a constantly-available network connection. Because I would rather not remove offline features from my app, and because I currently have very little time for app development, I do not plan any big changes to the app related to Files integration in the near future. When they do happen, I would expect that the UI of the app would be changed pretty significantly.\n<h2>iOS 12 Support for SwiftoDo</h2>The current version of SwiftoDo runs on iOS 12 without incident. I have, however, compiled a new version of SwiftoDo on the iOS 12 SDK. It has no new features, but the SDK is newer, so it inherits upstream bug fixes from Apple, and I updated my codebase to Swift 4.2. I am dropping support for iOS 10.x, too, because iOS 12 will be released imminently, and it honestly makes no sense for anyone with an iOS device from the past four years or so not to upgrade to it (iOS 12 performance is that good). Because of the under-the-hood changes, and the dropped compatibility with iOS 10, I am bumping the version number to 3.0.0. (Don’t get too excited!)\n<h2>macOS Mojave Support for SwiftoDo Desktop</h2>I am running the MacOS Mojave beta, and have been testing out its new dark mode. I love dark mode, and it took me about two seconds to realize that dark mode support is not a nice-to-have—it is an absolute necessity. Therefore, have coded support for it in a new build of SwiftoDo Desktop. I will submit it to the App Store soon.\n\nThe next version of SwiftoDo Desktop will be compiled on the macOS 10.4 SDK, and will no longer support macOS versions lower than that. (If you are not going to upgrade to Mojave, you can continue to use the version of SwiftDo Desktop you are currently using, of course.)\n\nOther than dark mode support, there are no new features. (Sorry!) Because of the under-the-hood changes, and the change in minimum system requirements, I am bumping the version number to 3.0.0, though. (Again, don’t get too excited, but be happy your app is being supported.)\n<h2>The future of SwiftoDo Desktop</h2>It is a weird coincidence that SwiftoDo and SwiftoDo Desktop will be on the same version number for a while, but it is only a coincidence. At present, they do not share any underlying code.\n\nMy long term plan is for SwiftoDo to resemble, and share tons of code with, the iPad version of SwiftoDo. The approach I would prefer to take would be to use the joint iOS/macOS framework that Apple said is coming next year. I will probably continue work on improving the iOS version’s codebase in preparation for eventual macOS support as well.\n\nI am not sure if every user will want the iOS version on the desktop, but I know that <em>I</em> would. I have considered releasing the next-generation version, whenever it is ready, under a new name (SwiftoDo Desktop 2, maybe) and SKU, so owners of the current SwiftoDo Desktop could continue to use it until it no longer functions on macOS. I have not decided exactly what I will do just yet.\n\nI do not expect that anyone outside Apple will learn anything about Apple’s new framework until WWDC 2019, which will be held in June. What I learn at that time will have significant impact on the direction in which I take SwiftoDo Desktop.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>In my mid 20s, I decided to move from boring (but nice) suburban Connecticut back to the Boston area where I went to college. It was a chance to reinvent myself, which is something I really needed to do at the time.</p>\n<p>In the process, I replaced a lot of my belongings—cheap things or hand-me-downs that I had since my college days—with newer, better versions. I replaced nearly everything I cooked with and ate with: dishes, pots and pans, and small appliances. I bought a new wardrobe and got rid of my ratty old T-shirts and jeans. I traded up from a slow and struggling Dell tower PC to a sleek, fast, white MacBook (my first Mac!).

				"content_text": "Recently I released a new iOS app: <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-call-blocker/id1409872025?ls=1&amp;mt=8\" title=\"Available on the App Store\">Simple Call Blocker</a>. \n\nIt is a <em>free</em> utility that lets you block unwanted calls to your iPhone. Unlike most of the call blockers on iOS, it allows you to block whole ranges of numbers, such as your phone number’s extension, <em>for free</em>. You may also <em>whitelist</em> numbers, ranges of numbers, or all your contacts’ phone numbers, so that they will not be blocked by this app, even if they are in the blacklist.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://simplecallblockerapp.com\">Simple Call Blocker website</a> explains it in more detail.\n\n<h2>Why did I write it?</h2>\n\nI wanted to write a small, relatively simple app that would allow me to explore the following things:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>iOS application architecture: I have been reading books and articles on iOS application architecture, and decided to create a new app to practice new techniques, such as the use of coordinators for navigation rather than storyboard segues, that I have been learning.</li>\n\t<li>algorithms and operation queues: I started the app by writing some simple algorithms for creating sequential phone number ranges to load into an <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit\">iOS CallKit directory extension</a>. The last thing I wrote was a multi-threaded operation queue for processing blacklist and whitelist rules and refreshing the iOS call directory extension that actually blocks the phone numbers.</li>\n\t<li>Core Data: I avoided learning Core Data for years; that changed with this app.</li>\n</ol>\n\nOverall, the app was a lot of fun to write. It took me about a month in my after-hours “free time” to create. The overall process has made me a better iOS app developer. I’m excited to bring forward the skills and concepts I developed on this project to future work.\n\n<h2>Why a call blocker app?</h2>\n\nI started getting <a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/en/us/article/news-releases/16670-a-new-kind-of-phone-scam-neighbor-spoofing\">neighbor spam calls</a>, so I downloaded nearly all the iOS call blocking apps I could find. There were fewer such apps than I thought there would be, all of them seemed amateurish in some way or another, and all of them (as of a month ago) required an in-app purchase or a subscription to block my neighborhood exchange. I wasn’t willing to pay for that feature in any of the apps that I tried, because all of those apps weren’t that good. Plus, blocking an exchange, or a continuous range of numbers, is pretty trivial, so I thought I could create an app that did that, and offer it for free to people. \n\n<h2>So is this just a “practice” app?</h2>\n\nNo. It is well-written and works as well as iOS’s Call Directory extensions allow it to. It has a rough edge or two, though, in that it reloads its directory extension and reports success or errors back to the users, rather than trying to prevent the user from ever encountering an error from being reported by the directory extension loading process.\n\nWhat that means is that you <em>can</em> ask Simple Call Blocker to block more numbers that iOS will allow—there is an undocumented limit—and the app has to wait for the CallKit Directory Extension’s load process to report success or failure before it can tell the user what is going on. I decided not to try to impose limits on how many numbers could be blacklisted, but instead allow the app to report the Directory Extension’s errors, if any, back to the user. I figure that the undocumented maximum number of blocked phone numbers probably is dependent on whatever hardware is in your phone, and probably is increasing in every new iPhone model.\n\nThe Simple Call Blocker directory extension is coded extremely conservatively, and it optimized for very low RAM and system usage. If iOS cannot load it, it is because the user put too many numbers in the blacklist, or because it is still loading numbers from a prior attempt.\n\nReleasing the app for free, I think, makes it OK that it may not work exactly as users expect it to.\n\n<h2>What is the future of this app?</h2>\n\nI plan to support it through various iOS releases, but otherwise not improve it too much. After all, it is a free app.\n\n<h2>I want to know more!</h2>\n\nGo ahead and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-call-blocker/id1409872025?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">download the app in the iOS App Store</a> (it’s free!), and check out the <a href=\"https://simplecallblockerapp.com\">FAQ</a> online.\n",

				"content_text": "\"<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17561768/dont-feed-the-trolls-online-harassment-abuse\">DON’T FEED THE TROLLS, AND OTHER HIDEOUS LIES</a>\" is a great article by \"Film Crit Hulk\" on our collective failure to respond properly to internet trolling culture. \n\n<blockquote>\nA Twitter follower reminded me of a line in the famous parable from Bion of Borysthenes: “Boys throw stones at frogs in fun, but the frogs do not die in fun, but in earnest.” Defenders of trolling insist it’s all just a joke, but if trolling is inherently designed to get a rise out of someone, then that’s what it really is. In many cases, it is designed to look and feel indistinguishable from a genuine attack. Whether you believe what you are saying or not is often immaterial because the impact is the same — and you are responsible for it, regardless of how funny you think it is.\n</blockquote>\n\nI think that there is a fundamental misunderstanding of trolling. It isn't a joke. It isn't done <em>for the lulz</em>. \"It's just a joke\" is an <em>obvious cover</em> for bad behavior. \n\nIt reminds me of an episode from my youth. In high school I had a friend who had a stash of <em>Playboy</em> magazines that he got (I think) from an older brother. Somehow we found out about them, demanded to see them, and teased him about them as we thumbed through them together. \"Why do you have these\" we would ask, teasingly, knowing full well why he had them. My friend's face would grow bright red and we would stammer: \"because they're so funny\". When pressed, he would double down on it: he would swear, up and down, that he had them because they were <em>hilarious</em>. Sure they were.\n\nIt puzzles me, why we act as if it's even possible that verbal abuse on the internet is \"just a joke\". A decent response to \"it was just a joke\" is \"it doesn't matter\".\n\n<blockquote>\nThe biggest mistake we ever made with trolls was making the question of abuse about how to placate and fix them instead of how to empower the people they hurt or manage your own well-being in the face of them. Like so many abused people, we thought the solutions involved walking on eggshells and not provoking them back. But instead, we must acknowledge “that we are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about who we pretend to be.” And that means acknowledging the awful, terrifying power of jokes and the immunity we seek in “not being serious.” This is exactly why people troll in the first place. Because deep down, they know it’s serious, and that’s exactly why it makes them feel powerful.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the online world, people who violate community standards should be banned from those communities. Gathering spaces online are not public spaces: almost all of them are owned by private companies or individuals. Freedom of speech is up to the owner of the space; the level of discourse there directly reflect's the owner as well. By law, they might not be legally responsible for the content of their site, but they are ethically and morally responsible for it, regardless. Owning and running a site where terrible things happen should be a black mark on a company’s or a person’s reputation—and that should matter.\n\nIt would be nice if people started to care about reputation again, and if bad reputations led to lower profits and lower stature in the global community.

I’m happy with what I am doing now, and thought I would document it in case anyone else wanted help understanding how to use the Pinboard effectively, especially if their usage lapsed, as mine did.\n\n<h2>What is Pinboard?</h2>\n\nPinboard is an “antisocial” cloud bookmarking service. You can keep all your bookmarks there and use its barebones website or third party apps and browser extensions, all using an open API, to access them. It’s a paid service, run by a single person, with a clear and straightforward business model. When I signed up, I pre-paid for ten years of service.

The other, more important part of that impetus is that I really like the simplicity and speed of Pinboard, and I like the Pinboard iOS client I use, <a href=\"http://pinnerapp.net\">Pinner</a>.\n\n<h2>What do I use it for?</h2>\n\nI use it for three things:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>To host my bookmarks in a cross-platform, always accessible way. I can get to the same bookmarks in Safari on my Mac and iOS, and in Chrome on Windows.</li>\n\t<li>For research and archival purposes, especially for programming projects I am working on. I can search these bookmarks on keywords, title, or description to review <em>the best</em> of the web pages I previously read on a topic of interest.</li>\n\t<li>As part of a homegrown “read it later” service. I can send article URLs to Pinboard from various apps, and read them later using Pinboard’s website, an app or browser extension on my Mac, and an app on iOS or Andriod.</li>\n</ol>\n\nNumber 3 used to be the <em>primary</em> purpose of Pinboard to me. I had signed up as part of an effort to get replace Pocket with something more privacy focused. After many years of using <a href=\"https://getpocket.com\">Pocket</a> (formerly “Read It Later”) to collect articles I was interested in from the huge stream of RSS feeds I parsed every day, I wanted a change. Primarily, this was because I became uncomfortable with Pocket’s business model: Why was it free? How did they really make money? What were they doing will all the data they collected on me? \n\nI also wasn’t crazy about some of the UI changes made to Pocket over the years. I wanted more control over the reading experience, too, which is something that using a web service with an open API would give me. It helps that, at the time, <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-use-reader-view-safari-iphone-and-ipad\">Safari’s Reader View</a> debuted, and I thought it was fantastic.\n\nI was pretty obsessive about channeling all the articles I read through Pinboard, so I had a one-way workflow from discovery to reading to marking read. I never deleted anything from Pinboard, either. I thought I wanted a history of all the articles I ever read, in case I wanted to search through that history later. (Of course, I never did that.)\n\n<h2>Why did I stop using it?</h2>\n\nI stopped using Pinboard for three main reasons:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>I started reading Twitter <em>more</em> than actual articles linked to from it. The constantly updating timeline was incredibly addictive, and less mentally taxing to follow than reading complex articles from actual publications. (I have since given up Twitter because it was <em>too</em> addictive for me to handle responsibly.)</li>\n\t<li>My wife and I had kids, meaning that I no longer had a bunch of downtime after dinner to catch up on all the articles I had bookmarked to read later. I would still send stuff to Pinboard to read later, but I would never actually read the articles.</li>\n\t<li>My wife and I subscribed to <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>The New York Times</em>, and <em>The Washington Post</em>. I started reading from those publications, from their apps, a lot more than scouring RSS feeds for articles from a dozen sources. Reading from their apps did not fit very well with my Pinboard workflow.</li>\n</ol>\n\nOverall, Pinboard became a graveyard for links I didn’t actually want to read. Instead of a useful resource, it was a junk pile full of stale content.\n\n<h2>Digging out of a mess</h2>\n\nI took the following steps to return Pinboard to a useful utility for me:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>I deleted <em>everything</em> I had in Pinboard—over 3,000 bookmarks that were doing me no good. Most of these were articles I imported from my RSS reader (Reeder) or Twitter (via Tweetbot), read once, and then just left in Pinboard.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>I installed <a href=\"https://aki-null.net/shiori/\">Shiori</a> on my MacBook Pro. Shiori is a Pinboard bookmark launcher and editor. It's like <a href=\"https://qsapp.com\">QuickSilver</a> for Pinboard—hidden until you need it, only a keypress away, and accessible from anywhere. I set it up so that Control+Option+Command+P brings up the bookmark search window (from anywhere), and Control+Option+Command+B brings up the bookmark editor.</li>\n\t<li>I set up <a href=\"http://pinnerapp.net\">Pinner</a> on iOS. Pinner is a full-featured Pinboard client. It will open Pinboard bookmarks in Safari or within Pinner, via Safari View Controller. It has two app extensions for creating bookmarks. The first extension, “Quick Pin”, has no UI, and is for quickly adding bookmarks to read later. The second extension lets you edit, interactively, all the metadata associated with the bookmark prior to saving it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>My workflow</h2>\n\nI developed a new workflow to work with Pinboard, so I don’t end up with a mess of useless bookmarks again. Honestly, though, calling it a <em>workflow</em> is an exaggeration. I basically decided to manage Pinboard with a simple set of rules.\n\nI will continue to use Pinboard both for permanent bookmarks, which mostly involve specific technical documentation about Swift and iOS development, and for a read-it-later service, which are bookmarks I want to keep around temporarily, some of which I plan to keep long term.\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Bookmarks I would keep in Safari, for sites I would log into (banking websites, personal websites, blogs, GitHub, BitBucket, etc.), are stored as private bookmarks with tags. All of these bookmarks are also tagged “Safari” so I can pull them all, as a group, with a Pinboard search.</li>\n\t<li>Bookmarks for articles to read later, and everything else, are saved with the “read later” flag set to “true”, primarily by using Pinner’s “Quick Pin” extension or the “send to Pinboard” command within <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/ios/\">Reeder</a> (my RSS reader app of choice).</li>\n\t<li>I regularly use Pinner or Shiori to browse my “read later” list. Basically, I had to kick the Twitter habit.</li>\n\t<li>After I read articles marked “read later”, I delete the bookmark, or choose to save it. I am pretty ruthless about deleting bookmarks now, which is the opposite of how I used to be. If I don’t read something after a few days, I will just delete it.</li>\n\t<li>Rarely, I will choose to save the bookmark. If I do so, I edit the bookmark’s metadata to remove the “read later” flag and to add keywords and a description. I open copy the first paragraph of the article to the bookmark’s description field, so it’s clear to me later on why I saved it.</li>\n</ol>\n\nSo far this workflow has been working well for me. I collect “read later” bookmarks throughout the day, read through them in the evening, and delete almost all of them at the end of the day. My Pinboard bookmarks list is much smaller than before, but contains only good stuff that I want to act on, either now or later.\n",

				"content_text": "<a href=\"http://getdrafts.com\">Drafts 5</a> is a great app for capturing thoughts, drafting notes, and capturing tasks, and quickly sending them, via <em>Actions</em>, to other apps or services for further processing. The typical workflow is:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Launch Drafts</li>\n \t<li>Type a draft</li>\n \t<li>Launch an Action to process the draft</li>\n</ol>On iPhone, swiping left from anywhere to pick an Action is right at your fingertips, since you are typing on screen. On iPad, if you type with an external keyboard (which I highly recommend), launching an Action is a little more cumbersome. By default, you have to move your fingers off the keyboard and reach up to the screen to get to your Actions list. There is another way to launch Actions, however, that doesn't require you to move your fingers off the keyboard.\n<h2>Custom hardware keyboard shortcuts</h2>Drafts 5 lets you assign custom hardware keyboard shortcuts to any Action. This is an extremely rare, and extremely powerful, feature. You can configure hardware keyboard shortcuts for text formatting commands and to insert text snippets (such as today's date) into your draft. You can also define a set of hardware keyboard shortcuts to use to complete your drafts.\n\nI use Drafts 5 throughout the day to write microblog posts, notes, and tasks and send them to where they need to go: Dropbox, Ulysses, my to-do app <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com\">SwiftoDo</a>, and so on. For all my most-used Actions that process drafts, I use an easy-to-mash but hard to accidentally type accelerator, <code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>, plus one letter, when I complete my draft and want to send it on its way.\n\nI use the <code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code> accelerator <em>only</em> for Actions that complete drafts, so it's always clear to me when I type it that I am ending my draft and sending it somewhere else.\n\nHere is my list of hardware keyboard shortcuts, each of which I find incredibly useful:\n<ul>\n \t<li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>D</code>: save draft to a Dropbox folder</li>\n \t<li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>U</code>: save draft to a Ulysses Inbox folder</li>\n \t<li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>T</code>: send tasks in draft to my todo.txt file via SwiftoDo</li>\n \t<li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>M</code>: post draft directly to Micro.blog</li>\n \t<li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>G</code>: search for draft text in Google</li>\n \t<li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>A</code>: search for draft text in App Store</li>\n</ul>Each shortcut is easily mapped to its Action via the \"Edit Action\" dialog. (See the photo that accompanies this blog post.) If you forget what custom shortcuts you created, hold down <code>Command</code> while editing your draft, and all the custom shortcuts you defined will appear in the standard iOS hardware keyboard shortcut pop-up display.\n\nThese hardware keyboard shortcuts don't necessarily save me a <em>lot</em> of time and trouble, but they make my Drafts workflow on iOS feel fast and comfortable. I highly recommend setting some up for your own iPad Drafts workflow.\n",

				"title": "SwiftoDo Development Notes, March 2018",
				"content_html": "<p>Today I released the ninth update to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SwiftoDo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in about ten weeks. What is driving all these small (but good!) releases? Two main things:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>SwiftoDo is a good app, but it is by no means perfect. There are a lot of things that can be improved. My development task list for the app is a mile long. For a long time, the most important items on that list were also the most difficult for me to implement. To be honest, some of those “most important” improvements <!-- raw HTML omitted -->feel like<!-- raw HTML omitted --> they are beyond my current capabilities as a developer—but that doesn’t mean that I can’t make improvements somewhere. The app can still get better.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, small things can make the app a lot better. Based on many emails with customers, I have learned that, a lot of times, a simple-to-implement feature, rather than a broad reimagining of a portion of the app, will make a big difference to their enjoyment of the app and the productivity they gain from it. That’s why I have been working on “small” features, such as the full file editor, that merely build on what was already there, but end up making the app more powerful and flexible for users. That is also my rationale behind improving application performance, which has become a much higher priority for me this year. Better performance benefits <!-- raw HTML omitted -->everybody<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>I also decided to release features and fixes regularly and frequently. Every week I ask myself, “How can you make the app better for your customers?” And, on another day each week, I ask myself, “Is my latest commit better than what my customers have?” Once I’m sure the new version is better than the last version, I release it.</p>\n<p>I figure that adding small features and fixing small bugs eventually accumulates, and my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->good<!-- raw HTML omitted --> app can eventually become a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->great<!-- raw HTML omitted --> app.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I’m working on SwiftoDo because it the app is useful to me and because it is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fun<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>Coding is fun for me, but certainly not every minute of it. Sometimes I have to fight with UIKit’s quirks or work around its bugs, which can take hours of frustrating work. Sometimes I fail to get a feature working without introducing a crash or breaking something else in the app. Sometimes things just don’t work, and it’s really hard to figure out why. Sometimes I’m stuck, and that’s no fun.</p>\n<p>I have decided not to remain stuck for more than a day or two anymore. If something isn’t working, I table the work and move onto smaller, solvable problems for a while. This philosophy has led me to work on features that seem simple, useful, and fun to code, but maybe not as important as the larger, more difficult things that have been blocking my progress. That explains why I’ve been pushing forward on improvements to the task text editor, for example, rather than adding new data providers. As a side benefit, working on those smaller things sometimes clears a way, either in the codebase or in my mind, to tackle those larger, more important items.</p>\n<p>So, what’s fun?

				"content_text": "Today I released the ninth update to <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com\">SwiftoDo</a> in about ten weeks. What is driving all these small (but good!) releases? Two main things:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>I want the app to get better</li>\n\t<li>I want to have fun</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>I want it to get better</h3>\n\nSwiftoDo is a good app, but it is by no means perfect. There are a lot of things that can be improved. My development task list for the app is a mile long. For a long time, the most important items on that list were also the most difficult for me to implement. To be honest, some of those “most important” improvements <em>feel like</em> they are beyond my current capabilities as a developer—but that doesn’t mean that I can’t make improvements somewhere. The app can still get better.\n\nSometimes, small things can make the app a lot better. Based on many emails with customers, I have learned that, a lot of times, a simple-to-implement feature, rather than a broad reimagining of a portion of the app, will make a big difference to their enjoyment of the app and the productivity they gain from it. That’s why I have been working on “small” features, such as the full file editor, that merely build on what was already there, but end up making the app more powerful and flexible for users. That is also my rationale behind improving application performance, which has become a much higher priority for me this year. Better performance benefits <em>everybody</em>.\n\nI also decided to release features and fixes regularly and frequently. Every week I ask myself, “How can you make the app better for your customers?” And, on another day each week, I ask myself, “Is my latest commit better than what my customers have?” Once I’m sure the new version is better than the last version, I release it.\n\nI figure that adding small features and fixing small bugs eventually accumulates, and my <em>good</em> app can eventually become a <em>great</em> app.\n\n<h3>I want to have fun</h3>\n\nI’m working on SwiftoDo because it the app is useful to me and because it is <em>fun</em>. \n\nCoding is fun for me, but certainly not every minute of it. Sometimes I have to fight with UIKit’s quirks or work around its bugs, which can take hours of frustrating work. Sometimes I fail to get a feature working without introducing a crash or breaking something else in the app. Sometimes things just don’t work, and it’s really hard to figure out why. Sometimes I’m stuck, and that’s no fun.\n\nI have decided not to remain stuck for more than a day or two anymore. If something isn’t working, I table the work and move onto smaller, solvable problems for a while. This philosophy has led me to work on features that seem simple, useful, and fun to code, but maybe not as important as the larger, more difficult things that have been blocking my progress. That explains why I’ve been pushing forward on improvements to the task text editor, for example, rather than adding new data providers. As a side benefit, working on those smaller things sometimes clears a way, either in the codebase or in my mind, to tackle those larger, more important items.\n\nSo, what’s fun? Racking up win after win, week after week, by pushing a better version of my app out to my users. And knowing, every day, that no matter what is <em>not</em> in the app yet, what <em>is</em> in the app keeps getting better.\n\n<h2>Version numbers</h2>\n\nSwiftoDo’s version number, currently at 2.9.2, is heading into the weird-looking, double-digit-minor-version-number terrority. The next version I release will be 2.10.0. \n\nAs Apple suggests, I’m using a 3-number <a href=\"https://semver.org\">semantic version numbering</a> system, with my own rules for what increments each component. Architectural changes to the app (such as a total rewrite) will bump the first number. Adding new user facing features will bump the second number. Fixing bugs or enhancing existing features, in minor ways, will bump the third number. \n\nBecause I am releasing so often now, and batching fewer new user-facing features together, the minor version number has been increasing rapidly. No one should care what the version number is, as long as it goes up. I don’t really care if it is, eventually, version 2.50.0. I does look a little funny to me, though.\n\n<h2>What about the Mac version?</h2>\n\nI have not been releasing updates to <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com/desktop\">SwiftoDo Desktop</a> recently. The main reason for that is that SwiftoDo Desktop is, basically, feature complete. Unfortunately, because it is coded in Objective C and relies on cell-based table views (mainly for the inline editing to work), it sits at a technological dead end. A total rewrite is in order. \n\nI have prepared for this scenario. My todo.txt-related code is in a framework that can be ported over to the Mac easily. In fact, I have started and stopped a total rewrite of the Mac version a couple times now, but have never gotten that far into it. The things holding me back are:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>I have to update my knowledge of AppKit, which is the Mac’s UI framework.</li>\n\t<li>The desktop app uses a different filtering system, which is a little harder to use than the iOS version’s filtering system, but it is much more powerful. I don’t really want to kill it off.</li>\n\t<li>SwiftoDo on iOS could always use more work, and it represents 70% of my user base.</li>\n</ol>\n\nIn June, Apple <em>may</em> announce <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/01/31/apple-still-plans-combined-ios-mac-apps-in-2018/\">a new framework</a> that would allow me to port my iOS code to the Mac much more easily. If that happens, my ability to provide an updated Mac version would be greatly improved.\n",

We are <em>far</em> from the world of mushy, sizzly 128kbps MP3 files now. That said, the lossless versions <em>do</em> sound a tiny bit better. They reveal more detail than the lossy version, notably in the snap of the bass guitar and in the attack of the snare drum. The difference is slight: you have to listen very carefully to hear it, and you need equipment sensitive enough to reproduce the sounds accurately.\n\nThe main improvement the hi-res version brings over the CD-quality rip, to my ears, is a lower noise floor.

				"content_text": "<a href=\"https://micro.blog/macgenie\">Jean McDonald</a>, Community Manager of <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a>, posted an essay today entitled \"<a href=\"http://micro.welltempered.net/2018/02/09/diversity-and-inclusion.html\">Diversity and Inclusion at Micro.blog: Where We Are, Where We Want to Go</a>\". \n\n<blockquote>\nThe question comes up regularly: to what extent is there diversity in the Micro.blog community? We only ask for a name and an email address to register, so we don’t have any demographics on the users in our community. But I do know, based on skimming the names of those who register, that the percentage of users with typically female names is very small. When I look at users whose avatars are photos of themselves, I suspect the percentage of people of color is also very small.\n</blockquote>\n\nI have been thinking about diversity on the platform since I started using it, the day it opened to the public in December 2017. Jean's essay inspired me to publish some of my thoughts.\n\n<h2>What do we expect?</h2>\n\nThe Micro.blog service has not been a publicly available for long. At this point, it is understandable that the first wave of users would be primarily composed of fans of its founder, Manton Reece. Manton is an iOS and macOS developer who blogs and podcasts about his development work and the indie web. If you have come across his work online, you are probably very much like him: an iOS or macOS developer, or at least a passionate user; a tech podcast listener; or a passionate blogger or IndieWeb aficionado. This core group is, for reasons related to historical and cultural biases, <em>not</em> a particularly diverse one.\n\nThis core group describes <em>me</em>, and certainly does not describe <em>everyone</em> on Micro.blog, but it does describe a lot of the users I found on the service's <a href=\"https://micro.blog/discover\">Discover</a> page. Manton and Jean have expressed, from the very beginning, an earnest desire to create a safe community of independent micro blogs—\"safe\" from the abuse that silences disempowered people, women, and minorities on dominant social media platforms. They, along with the users of the platform, have openly discussed how to increase diversity, and the challenges inherent in doing so. I have learned a lot from reading these blog posts and discussions. Like them, I wish for Micro.blog to attract and retain a more diverse user base. The question we all face now is: how?\n\nHere are a few ideas.\n\n<h2>Recognize and publicize that community guidelines are intrinsic to the product</h2>\n\n<a href=\"https://micro.blog/macgenie/325883\">Jean McDonald</a>:\n\n<blockquote>\nNo one should feel unwelcome here.\n</blockquote>\n\nThis should be one of the public-facing mantras that applies to the entire project, much like \"Don't be evil\" was to Google for many years. Jean's quote should be atop the \"Community Guidelines\" page, and a link to that page should be near the top of the \"help.micro.blog\" page.\n\nI think Micro.blog should put a lot more focus on the community guidelines and whatever technology or processes are used to enforce them. It's a key feature of the platform. People behaving <em>well</em> together is the core of the product for me, and a key differentiator between it and Twitter.\n\n<h2>Refine the marketing message</h2>\n\nWhat is Micro.blog, anyway? To <a href=\"https://indieweb.org\">IndieWeb</a> people, it's kind of obvious. To everybody else, maybe not.\n\nIf asked, today, to sell it to someone, I might say: \"It's the good parts of Twitter, with none of the bad parts.\" I might explain that microblogging is simply sharing something about yourself in public, and that Micro.blog is a <em>safe</em>, <em>respectful</em> place to do so, because it has protections against abuse, and strict community guidelines. If they are unsure why they should share thing in public, I would explain that it is <em>empowering</em> to do so. It is putting your best foot forward online.\n\n<h2>Promote on podcasts</h2>\n\nHaving a simple, concise marketing message is essential, but that message needs to be spread somehow. One of the best ways to market these days is on podcasts.\n\nManton has a <a href=\"https://coreint.org\">podcast</a> and a <a href=\"http://timetable.manton.org\">microcast</a>, which have brought a lot of people to Micro.blog thus far. I think podcasts are a great opportunity to promote the open, inclusive, but safe nature of Micro.blog. While podcast audiences may, as a whole, skew white, male, and wealthy, there <em>are</em> tons of podcasts out there that are hosted by, feature as panelists, and cater to women and minorities. I'm sure that Manton is adjacent enough to other tech podcasters to get some guest spots on tech podcasts that feature or cater to these groups. \n\n<h2>Ask users for help</h2>\n\nMicro.blog users are all, at this point, early adopters, and most of us are especially committed to the platform and want it to succeed. Ask us to publicize the service. Give us some ideas how to do that effectively, and in ways that will increase diversity. Provide incentives for us to sign up new people, such as additional badges (which are free to provide) or free months of Micro.blog hosting (which of course incurs a cost). I'm sure something will come of it.\n\n<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>\n\nMy list of suggestions is by no means exhaustive, and Manton and Jean are likely in a better position than I am to understand what they need to do, and what they can do.

There is a lot of crapware in the Windows Store, several world class apps from Adobe that everyone knows about, and not that much in between.

				"content_text": "I am still using the <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net\">Plaintext Productivity</a> system that I wrote about in 2013. It is a productivity system, based primarily on plaintext files, for Microsoft Windows users. Since I published a few people have asked me to write an update to <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net\">Plaintext Productivity</a>. The fact is, the system has held up so well for me that I really don’t have any updates to report.\n\nOne reason my system remains pretty much the same as it was in 2013 is that the operating system it is based on, <em><a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/index.html#why-is-windows-important-\">Windows</a></em>, despite some cosmetic changes, remains pretty much the same as it was in 2013. Sure, it got a better UI when Windows 10 supplanted Windows 7 and 8, but Windows still <em>works</em> just as well and just as poorly. Another pillar of the system, <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com\">Sublime Text</a>, also had a design change recently, to display more crisply on high-DPI screens, but it, too, works pretty much the same as it did in 2013.\n<h2>A little bit of history</h2>\nI developed my <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net\">Plaintext Productivity</a> system slowly over the years, as a result of the limitations I faced on my relatively locked down work computers, and my frustration with third party productivity apps going out of business and disappearing over the years. Gradually, I stripped down my productivity system to <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com\">a great text editor</a> and a <a href=\"https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt\">todo.txt-format</a> task list (with <a href=\"http://benrhughes.github.io/todotxt.net/\">a good client</a>), with some clever ideas about using a <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/2-09-work-journal.html\">journal</a> for planning, and for <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/3-00-files-introduction.html\">managing files</a>.\n\nBecause I was stuck on Windows, an operating system I did not particular like, I had to make do with built-in functionality, portable apps that I could sneak onto my system, and a universal file format: plaintext. Even this was challenging. Windows, for all it’s ubiquity, has a dearth of good <em>third party</em> (non-Microsoft) software for it. There is a lot of crapware in the Windows Store, several world class apps from Adobe that everyone knows about, and not that much in between. Macintosh, iOS, and to a far lesser extent, Android, have attracted the attention on small, boutique publishers and indie developers who have contributed great plaintext-based apps. <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com\">Like me</a>.\n<h2>Notes and drafts</h2>\nI still firmly believe in <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/2-00-notes-and-drafts-introduction.html\">writing lots of notes and drafts</a> to help document thoughts as well as meetings. I draft emails, write planning documents, write out procedures for work I have to repeat, and so on. I also keep a <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/2-09-work-journal.html\">work journal</a> every day (well, I’m not perfect about writing it <em>every</em> single day, but I try). At the start of each workday, I write a short journal post to plan my top activities for the day. At the end of each workday, I wrote an even shorter journal entry to help remind me where I left things, which sets me up for the next day. I set up calendar entries to remind me to do these journal entries. These activities help keep me, a person who works remotely and alone, organized, engaged with my work, and on task throughout the day.\n<h2>My text editor</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com\">Sublime Text</a> is still my favorite Windows text editor. It is even better than when I first bought it, over five years ago, and it was worth every penny. I love that it is lean, fast, flexible, and handles both my short notes and huge data files with aplomb. Its plugin system makes it a serviceable Markdown editor. I have syntax highlighting for Markdown, HTML, todo.txt, TaskPaper, and the various programming languages I use at work: ACL scripts (which I created myself), SQL, C#, VBScript, and Python (and there are far more available).\n\nBest of all, in my opinion, are its numerous, well-defined keyboard shortcuts for shifting lines around, selecting words, selecting whole lines, deleting whole lines, and so on. Its support for multiple text selection and multiple cursors makes certain quick edits, like making a bunch of lines a bullet list in Markdown, a snap; it’s actually kind of mind blowing when you get used to it. Lastly, I=its find and replace functionality is incredibly powerful as well, considering it supports regular expressions.\n\nI have found no compelling reason to switch it out for a newer, shiner app—which is the whole point of having a simple productivity system in the first place.\n\nI should say, though, that I do use Editorial or Ulysses on my iPad as a sidekick text editor quite frequently. I started to do so for a non-software related reason: my work machine’s mechanical keyboard is so loud that it bothers people on conference calls, while my iPad’s keyboard—the Apple Magic Keyboard—is so quiet that my phone does not pick it up. Those iOS apps are fantastic, but they are not vital to my Plaintext Productivity system.\n<h2>My task list</h2>\nI still <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/1-00-tasks-introduction.html\">use todo.txt for my work task list</a>. Since I wrote Plaintext Productivity, I contributed a ton of patches to my favorite Windows todo.txt app: todotxt.net. I contributed multiple task selection and editing, and a lot of other things. I went on to write Mac and iOS todo.txt apps, <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com/desktop\">SwiftoDo Desktop</a> and <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com\">SwiftoDo for iOS</a>. I tend to use SwiftoDo for iOS most of the time, and revert to todotxt.net only when I don’t want to context-switch away from my PC to my iPad or iPhone. My todo.txt file is synced via Dropbox between all these apps, so it doesn’t really matter which app I use at any given moment.\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt\">Todo.txt</a> is the best system for me because my work, and my GTD-inspired way of looking at my work, tends to present itself as a large number of tasks that get picked up, dropped, and re-prioritized frequently. I have started to dabble with <a href=\"https://www.taskpaper.com\">TaskPaper</a> for some of my planning needs, either in my daily work journaling, or when I have a self-directed project to plan, such as drafting a proposal or creating a software-based audit tool. TaskPaper is interesting, but I do too much sorting and filtering of tasks throughout the day for it to supplant todo.txt as my main task list system.\n\nI don’t keep track of every task in my life in todo.txt, however. I prefer to keep my personal tasks separate from my work ones, mainly because I find having them commingled with work tasks distracts me from my work. Therefore, I keep my personal tasks in <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205890\">Reminders</a>, which has had solid Siri support and cross-Apple-device syncing since 2011, and has only gotten better since then. I <em>have</em> changed a lot about how I managed non-work tasks since 2013, but those fall outside my Plaintext Productivity system.\n<h2>Filing and searching</h2>\nI still use the same <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/3-00-files-introduction.html\">filing system</a>, too, and have been consistently happy with it. While I believe that you should rely on search rather than elaborate folder structures for finding what you need to, Windows Search <em>still</em> is not great. Despite its weaknesses, and the frustrations those weaknesses sometimes cause, I still get by with it.\n<h2>Hardware and other things</h2>\nI also wrote about <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/4-05-hardware.html\">hardware</a> and <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/4-00-other-tips.html\">other things</a> in Plaintext Productivity. Since 2013, I have had the fortune to upgrade my keyboard to a 87-key mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Blue switches. I really like the clicky-clacky keyboard switches and the keyboard’s smaller size, which I credit with helping eliminate repetitive stress injuries in my wrists. I also made things easier on my eyes by upgrading my display from two 1080p monitors to one, much bigger, 4K display. Crisper text has reduced eyestrain and has made me much happier, though Windows has had, and <em>still has</em>, awful and inconsistent high-DPI support. I don’t miss having two screens at all, actually. I can tile two to four windows on screen, and use the virtual desktop feature that premiered in Windows 10, to get most of the benefits that multiple monitors afforded me in the past.\n<h2>The future of plaintext productivity</h2>\nI have never used the same productivity system for so long. It has been solid and reliable for me for years now, and required no real tweaks worth mentioning when upgrading from Windows XP to Windows 7 to Windows 10. I see no obvious need to replace or upgrade my system in the near future, either. Maybe someday, when everything is in virtual reality or something—but maybe not even then.\n\nIf you are interested in streamlining your Windows workflows, and discovering a productivity system that really lasts, I encourage you to check out my <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net\">Plaintext Productivity</a> guide.\n",

For example, I type most calendar entries and Google searches in Drafts (which is in my home screen toolbar) and, in two taps, open them for processing in Fantastical or Safari (which are not in my toolbar). Drafts 4, which has been out quite a while now, expands on that basic idea, and delivers a very useful utility and a top-notch text editor.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Drafts is already well known for its automation capabilities. It is great for drafting a tweet and posting it to Twitter (either natively or via another app), or for writing out a calendar entry and pushing it to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fantastical<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Calendars 5<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for parsing. What it is not well known for—but should be—is that it is the most customizable text editor on iOS. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Editorial<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has long held that crown, thanks to its its support of snippets and extensibility with Python scripts. Drafts, however, outdoes Editorial when it comes to customizing the editor itself, which has a profound effect on  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->writing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> experience.</p>\n<p>In Drafts, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->actions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> can change the text your are writing, send some or all of it to another app, turn on/off night mode within the app, and so on. You can download actions from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the developer’s extensive library<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, of, if you are a bit of a programmer, you can them yourself in JavaScript, from within the app. You can assign these actions to the main menu, which is accessible from the top-right icon, or from a swipe to the left. That’s the basic stuff. You can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->also<!-- raw HTML omitted --> assign these actions to a custom toolbar that is displayed over the keyboard. Even better, for hardware keyboard users, you can assign your own hardware keyboard shortcuts to these actions, too. No other iOS app that I use does this!</p>\n<p>I use Drafts on my iPad primarily for writing notes, such as when I get a phone call or am in a meeting. I use my custom toolbar buttons to input today’s date, paste text, format headings and lists in Markdown, send various lines (text selections) to my todo.txt file (via Dropbox), and so on. At the end of my writing session, I send the entire note to Dropbox for storage.</p>\n<p>Notes don’t have to be exported, however. They can stay in Drafts and sync to all your other iOS devices via iCloud. You can also organize them there. There are three basic folders—Inbox, Archive, and Trash—to put notes into. You can flag notes for future retrieval, and filter them them by folder, flag status, and keywords (search terms within the note text) into custom “folders” or saved searches as well. I have not switched over to using Drafts as a full-fledged notes app (most of my drafts get automatically deleted after 30 days in the Trash folder), but I am thinking about it.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Drafts 4 has been around for a while now. Drafts 5 is coming, someday, with even more features: TaskPaper editing is a feature that I am looking forward to. I expect the pricing model to change from paid upfront to a subscription; I will be happy to pay for it, as a valuable companion to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ulysses<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for writing, and a valuable sidekick to practically every other app in the iOS ecosystem.</p>\n",

Drafts 4, which has been out quite a while now, expands on that basic idea, and delivers a very useful utility and a top-notch text editor.\n\n<h2>Not just for automation—for writing!</h2>\n\nDrafts is already well known for its automation capabilities. It is great for drafting a tweet and posting it to Twitter (either natively or via another app), or for writing out a calendar entry and pushing it to <a href=\"https://flexibits.com/fantastical-ipad\">Fantastical</a> or <a href=\"https://readdle.com/products/calendars5\">Calendars 5</a> for parsing. What it is not well known for—but should be—is that it is the most customizable text editor on iOS. <a href=\"http://omz-software.com/editorial/\">Editorial</a> has long held that crown, thanks to its its support of snippets and extensibility with Python scripts. Drafts, however, outdoes Editorial when it comes to customizing the editor itself, which has a profound effect on  <em>writing</em> experience.\n\nIn Drafts, <em>actions</em> can change the text your are writing, send some or all of it to another app, turn on/off night mode within the app, and so on. You can download actions from <a href=\"https://drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com\">the developer’s extensive library</a>, of, if you are a bit of a programmer, you can them yourself in JavaScript, from within the app. You can assign these actions to the main menu, which is accessible from the top-right icon, or from a swipe to the left. That’s the basic stuff. You can <em>also</em> assign these actions to a custom toolbar that is displayed over the keyboard. Even better, for hardware keyboard users, you can assign your own hardware keyboard shortcuts to these actions, too. No other iOS app that I use does this!\n\nI use Drafts on my iPad primarily for writing notes, such as when I get a phone call or am in a meeting. I use my custom toolbar buttons to input today’s date, paste text, format headings and lists in Markdown, send various lines (text selections) to my todo.txt file (via Dropbox), and so on. At the end of my writing session, I send the entire note to Dropbox for storage. \n\nNotes don’t have to be exported, however. They can stay in Drafts and sync to all your other iOS devices via iCloud. You can also organize them there. There are three basic folders—Inbox, Archive, and Trash—to put notes into. You can flag notes for future retrieval, and filter them them by folder, flag status, and keywords (search terms within the note text) into custom “folders” or saved searches as well. I have not switched over to using Drafts as a full-fledged notes app (most of my drafts get automatically deleted after 30 days in the Trash folder), but I am thinking about it.\n\n<h2>Drafts in the future</h2>\n\nDrafts 4 has been around for a while now. Drafts 5 is coming, someday, with even more features: TaskPaper editing is a feature that I am looking forward to. I expect the pricing model to change from paid upfront to a subscription; I will be happy to pay for it, as a valuable companion to <a href=\"https://ulyssesapp.com\">Ulysses</a> for writing, and a valuable sidekick to practically every other app in the iOS ecosystem.\n",

At the same time, I hate Twitter, for all the bad behavior performed on the platform that Twitter, the company, tolerates. I’m not alone. A lot of people I follow feel the same way. I see tweets like this almost every day:\n<blockquote>Brad DeLong: “I wish there was a network like twitter, but not, you know, actually Twitter”</blockquote>\n&nbsp;\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">The folks at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@twitter</a> are spineless cowards.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">I wish there was a network like twitter, but not, you know, actually twitter\n\n— Dave DeLong (@davedelong) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davedelong/status/936365347615137793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 30, 2017</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>The thing is, practically since Twitter’s inception, alternatives <em>did</em> exist. I know. I used them: Identi.ca, StatusNet (the successor to Identi.ca), Pump.io (the successor to StatusNet), and App.net (a for-fee Twitter that got a lot of press but not so many users). And, I abandoned them and went back to Twitter, despite its flaws. So did everybody else.\n<h2>Why is Twitter so sticky, and nothing else is?</h2>\nWhat makes Twitter is valuable not what it does—microblogging is relatively easy to implement these days—but <em>who is on it</em>: Famous people! Intellectuals! Politicians! Journalists! These people and many more are not only publishing there, but reading there, too. Communication with, and between, influential people there can be two-way, and is usually in public, which is fascinating to read and unlike any other communications platform that had come before it. Twitter can amplify the voice of the non-famous and non-published people, too—the under-represented—which is often great.\n<h2>Why is Twitter described as a cesspool?</h2>\nSometimes, though, amplifying under-represented voices is <em>not</em> great. Some voices are under-represented because they are malicious: Racists! Nazis! Liars! Sexist doxxers! Spammers! Russian bots! Malicious people have unique incentives to exploit and abuse a communications platform like Twitter. First, simply <em>having</em> a medium and a platform to spread their message is unique to them, because these people have been barred or banned elsewhere from spreading their message. Second, access to this new platform may be fleeting, because they could be banned there, too, for the same reasons they have been banned elsewhere. Third, people who want to spread malice are not the type of people who are concerned with preserving the health of the platform’s community, or the platform’s reputation in the wider world. Therefore, they can destroy the platform in the process of spreading their message.\n<h2>Why can’t Twitter fix this?</h2>\nThe world is too complex to separate people, or Twitter users, into good and bad actors. What is unpopular or under-represented today may be celebrated tomorrow; it may be true and worth spreading today. Understandably, Twitter doesn’t want to choose who gets to speak on their platform. Therefore, they tolerate hate speech on their platform to a degree that makes some of their users angry. It puts the company in a difficult position when hate speech is broadcast (retweeted) by the President of the United States, as it was this week.\n\nI understand Twitter’s problems as a company. It needs eyeballs on it to sell ads. Controversy on the platform, and the sheer number of active users (whether they are real people or bots), lead to greater traffic, greater revenue, and greater return on investment for their investors—at least in the short run. In the long run, however, poisonous speech on the platform poisons the platform.\n<h2>What to do about it, as a Twitter user?</h2>\nBasically, it is hard to see how, as users, we can improve Twitter. Twitter, the company, owns the platform. Consequently, it has the sole power to fix its flaws. Improvements to blocking and reporting abuse that Twitter has implemented have not satisfied the users who need them the most.\n\nMoving away from Twitter entirely, onto another, similar platform, can work for small communities who primarily wish to communicate amongst themselves. It is unlikely, however, that a critical mass of influential users—the celebrities, journalists, etc., who make the platform valuable—will move to a different platform at this point. Without those users, another platform, however superior from a technical or community management standpoint, would not have as much value.\n\nAs a Twitter user, you really have two choices now: live with the abusive users, and report and block them as well as you can; or, if Twitter abuse is bothering you enough (or worse, threatening to your safety), stop using Twitter entirely. That is a sad conclusion to make, but I think it is realistic. Twitter’s ad-based model, need to generate both traffic and return on investment to satisfy its shareholders are, in the short run, at odds with its stated goal to improve safety, and therefore community, on its platform.\n\nFortunately, there are other ways to write content on the internet for free, such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.com\">WordPress</a>. The problem is, you may never achieve the same reach with these other platforms as you would with Twitter. That is why I am sticking with Twitter myself. From a moralistic point of view, I would love to ditch it for something else. Despite that feeling, I get enough value from Twitter to keep using it, despite the sick-to-my-stomach feeling the Twitterverse gives me some days.\n",

Like those writers and podcasters said, the basic need RSS fulfilled for me—keeping current, and entertained with fresh reading material—<em>was</em> being fulfilled by other services.

Worse, it fed me five or six different publications’ takes on the same subject every day, which was interesting a few days of the year (such as when reviews of new Apple devices hit the streets), but was otherwise completely redundant.\n<h2>What I missed without RSS</h2>After a year RSS-free, I started to think something was missing. I was literally missing articles that I would like to read, especially those from bloggers I liked, such as <a href=\"http://ericasadun.com\">Erica Sadun</a> and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net\">John Gruber</a>, because they would pass by in the timeline before I would see them. I was missing bloggers’ voices in general, because most of my Twitter list (like everybody’s, I’m sure) is heavily <em>news</em> related. I could keep up with what the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com\">New York Times</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com\">Washington Post</a> are publishing each day pretty well; but what about what <a href=\"http://www.manton.org\">Manton Reece</a> and <a href=\"http://marginalrevolution.com\">Tyler Cowlin</a> are publishing? Their voices were being buried in my Twitter feed by the daily (hourly?) news cycle.\n\nWithout RSS, I missed the spirit of the independent web: all those individuals and small publications who are sharing knowledge and expressing opinions that don’t fit into 140 characters, or even 280.\n<h2>Back to RSS (and Atom, and JSON Feed)</h2>After many months away from it, I realized that RSS wasn’t the problem—I was. I wasn’t using RSS in a way that made me happy. Worse, I supplanted it with Twitter, which both sucked up all my attention every day, and reduced my attention span for content to 140 characters (a length perfect for snipes and jabs and headlines, but insufficient for most cogent thoughts). Fortunately, RSS has not died since the rise of Twitter and Facebook. It has quietly remained a fundamental internet technology, undergirding nearly every online publishing platform. Many, many sites support it without advertising it the way they used to ten years ago. Luckily, any good client can find feeds using just the site URL.\n\nNot only RSS is still there: my longstanding RSS software is still there, too. Like in 2013, I am using <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/ios/\">Reeder</a> on iOS as a front end, and <a href=\"https://feedly.com/\">Feedly</a> as a back end. Reeder has been around almost as long as the App Store. It is rarely updated, but it just works. It’s simplicity, elegance, and stability make it one of the finest apps on the platform.

I don’t use their app. I don’t really know or care how they make money off of me. It, like Reeder, is solid, stable, and just works.\n<h2>Using RSS with a different perspective</h2>After returning to my RSS reader after such a long break, I had thousands of unread items and dozens of subscriptions. I decided to start over, so I unsubscribed to all my feeds, and started thinking about what I really wanted to get out of RSS, and, in general, out of the Internet.\n\nI decided to use RSS differently now. I no longer need it to drink the content firehose and keep current with the minute-by-minute news cycle; Twitter is available for that, for good or ill.

The iPhone 8, for example, is the fourth generation of iPhone with the same basic form factor. A few years back, this would have been unheard of. A few years from now, though, I wouldn’t be surprised if there still is a “legacy” iPhone out there with this form factor, discounted several hundred dollars below what the iPhone X form-factor phone of the day will cost.</p>\n<p>If all smartphones have the same basic shape, does it even matter which one you have?

Third, it was ungainly: not only was it a large phone that strained my hand and my pockets, but its edges were smooth and slippery.

(Yes, I know the leather case is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the phone, but as it was an Apple product released alongside the phone, I think it is fair to include it in my assessment here.)

First, it looks great: the black finish is gorgeous and even blends seamlessly with Apple’s black leather case. Second, it feels great: I like the feel of the back much better, and the Apple leather case that came out with it has better quality leather, and clicky buttons on the sides. Its Taptic Engine, which provides force feedback for 3D Touch, the home button, and various user interface interactions, is absolutely amazing. It makes certain interactions, like scrolling picker views, 3D touching app icons, or pressing the home button, feel like you are interacting with actual, three-dimensional objects. It doesn’t vibrate as much as tap you with a reassuring, nearly soundless thud. The force feedback feels so good that it is almost addicting.

				"title": "Deciding Whether to Upgrade to the iPhone X",
				"content_html": "<p>Last year, prior to Apple’s announcement of the iPhone 7, I had hoped for the “all-screen” design that was announced last week for the iPhone X. I was sure that would be my next phone. Now that it is here, one year later, I am not sure if I want it—at least not yet.</p>\n<p>As an iPhone Upgrade Plan customer, I have three options at my disposal:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The iPhone X starts at $999. The model with more storage that I would buy is $150 more, and AppleCare Plus costs about $200 on top of that. That represents a huge outlay for the phone. I don’t begrudge Apple for pricing the iPhone X so high, or other people for buying it without worrying about its cost. The high price is, however, a hint that the X may not be for me—at least not this year.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>While I love the idea of “renting” a smartphone with a fixed monthly cost (hardware as a service), it doesn’t really work that way. You actually have to buy the phone, and deal with the downsides that entails.</p>\n<p>When I upgraded to the iPhone 7, I was surprised that I would have to pay 100% of the taxes on the new phone (about $100), plus a fee to activate it on my Verizon account (about $20). I had been thinking only about the difference in the monthly phone payment I would make, which was minuscule, and the expected cost to buy a new, compatible case. I was out over $100 for the new phone, and realized that I had already paid those costs one year earlier for the 7, and was giving up that hardware completely. On top of that, the case cost a lot, too (about $50). It is easy to forget about these costs when (1) the cost of the phone dwarfs them, and (2) the main cost of the phone is a relatively small monthly payment.</p>\n<p>This year, wiser about the switching costs, I am just not sure if it is worth it to go from the 7 to the 8 Plus or X.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Coming from the Plus, the iPhone X actually represents a step down in screen size (though it has a higher native resolution), lacks Touch ID, and has a smaller battery. I am not sure how my apps will look on the iPhone X screen. I bet developers will have to figure out how best to handle the notch and curved corners. (I am a little worried about my iOS app, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SwiftoDo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, too.) Face ID might be slower or less convenient than Touch ID. Battery life might not be as good as on my one-year old, heavily used iPhone 7 Plus, or even the new iPhone 8 Plus.</p>\n<p>Considering these minor drawbacks and unknowns, it might be nice to sit out the period in which users and developers figure out the new hardware, and Apple fixes any iPhone X-related software bugs.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The iPhone 8 Plus is actually pretty attractive, despite having the same old (but good!) case design as the iPhone 6, 6S, and 7. I’m sure demand for it will be rather low, by iPhone standards. I would actually be able to get one soon. It is at least $300 cheaper than the iPhone X.

				"content_text": "Last year, prior to Apple’s announcement of the iPhone 7, I had hoped for the “all-screen” design that was announced last week for the iPhone X. I was sure that would be my next phone. Now that it is here, one year later, I am not sure if I want it—at least not yet. \n\nAs an iPhone Upgrade Plan customer, I have three options at my disposal:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Do nothing, upgrade to something new next year, keep my iPhone 7, and give it to one of my kids, put it in a drawer, or sell it for peanuts in 2018.</li>\n\t<li>Pre-order the iPhone 8 Plus, which would presumably be available soon, as the most rabid Apple fans will prefer to skip it and get the X. I would have to turn in the iPhone 7 around month 12 or 13 of my 24-month payment plan.</li>\n\t<li>Wait until next month and pre-order the iPhone X via the iPhone Upgrade Plan. I would likely have to wait a couple months for the phone to be available (probably January). I would have to turn in the iPhone 7 around month 15 of my 24-month payment plan.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Cost: the main reason to skip the iPhone X for me</h2>\n\nThe iPhone X starts at $999. The model with more storage that I would buy is $150 more, and AppleCare Plus costs about $200 on top of that. That represents a huge outlay for the phone. I don’t begrudge Apple for pricing the iPhone X so high, or other people for buying it without worrying about its cost. The high price is, however, a hint that the X may not be for me—at least not this year.\n\n<h2>Additional switching costs of an early upgrade</h2>\n\nWhile I love the idea of “renting” a smartphone with a fixed monthly cost (hardware as a service), it doesn’t really work that way. You actually have to buy the phone, and deal with the downsides that entails.\n\nWhen I upgraded to the iPhone 7, I was surprised that I would have to pay 100% of the taxes on the new phone (about $100), plus a fee to activate it on my Verizon account (about $20). I had been thinking only about the difference in the monthly phone payment I would make, which was minuscule, and the expected cost to buy a new, compatible case. I was out over $100 for the new phone, and realized that I had already paid those costs one year earlier for the 7, and was giving up that hardware completely. On top of that, the case cost a lot, too (about $50). It is easy to forget about these costs when (1) the cost of the phone dwarfs them, and (2) the main cost of the phone is a relatively small monthly payment.\n\nThis year, wiser about the switching costs, I am just not sure if it is worth it to go from the 7 to the 8 Plus or X.\n\n<h2>Other reasons why I am iffy on the X</h2>\n\nComing from the Plus, the iPhone X actually represents a step down in screen size (though it has a higher native resolution), lacks Touch ID, and has a smaller battery. I am not sure how my apps will look on the iPhone X screen. I bet developers will have to figure out how best to handle the notch and curved corners. (I am a little worried about my iOS app, <a href=\"http://swiftodoapp.com\">SwiftoDo</a>, too.) Face ID might be slower or less convenient than Touch ID. Battery life might not be as good as on my one-year old, heavily used iPhone 7 Plus, or even the new iPhone 8 Plus.\n\nConsidering these minor drawbacks and unknowns, it might be nice to sit out the period in which users and developers figure out the new hardware, and Apple fixes any iPhone X-related software bugs.\n\n<h2>What about the iPhone 8 Plus?</h2>\n\nThe iPhone 8 Plus is actually pretty attractive, despite having the same old (but good!) case design as the iPhone 6, 6S, and 7. I’m sure demand for it will be rather low, by iPhone standards. I would actually be able to get one soon. It is at least $300 cheaper than the iPhone X. The model I want costs $949, which is really expensive, but my monthly iPhone Upgrade Plan payment would not change.\n\n<h2>What to do?</h2>\n\nIf money were no object, I would buy the X outright sometime soon and never use the iPhone Upgrade Plan again. Because that is not the case, I am leaning most heavily towards skipping an upgrade this year. I will deal with decreasing battery life and knowing I don’t have the best camera or performance anymore, but I will not suffer much. Or, I may just order the iPhone 8 Plus and not worry about the X until next year. I will go to an Apple Store in the next few weeks to test my resolve.\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I just spent $30 on an annual subscription to Ulysses, my favorite writing app (it is not <em>quite</em> a &quot;text editor&quot;) on macOS and iOS. It was a relatively expensive macOS and iOS app for years, and I thought of it as the best buy I ever made on the platform, because I always bought it on steep discount the day it was released, and upgrades have been free ever since. As much as I love it, I have never used it enough, mostly because I spend time programming rather than writing. That may change now, however, because I am paying now a lot more for the privilege to use it. Overall, I decided it is worth my money to continually support the software I love. That said, the much higher cost of Ulysses and other apps I rely on probably means I will be trying and buying far fewer alternatives. </p><p>There is a limit on how much I want to pay each year, total, for software. I am not sure what that limit is, however. It is over $100, I guess, based on my spending history. But it&apos;s not that much higher than that&#x2014;and I am a person who <em>loves</em> software. I will have to choose my apps with way more discipline and effort now that many will be an ongoing cost to me. I will be choosing just one text editor for $30 per year, rather than buying the top six of them for $5 apiece and maybe upgrading one or two of them to new versions, for another $5 apiece, after a couple of years.</p><p>I hope this arrangement will lead to better software, and more well-supported software, overall. It looks like it will have the side effect of reducing the number of apps on my home screen to an essential, more costly, more sophisticated few. That&apos;s not necessarily a bad thing. But it further raises the bar for new indie developers&#x2014;those without venture backing&#x2014;who are working on the next new thing.</p>\n",

It promises rock solid communication between the iPad and the keyboard, meaning no dropped keypresses, which are my chief complaint about using Bluetooth keyboards.

The main one for me is dropped keystrokes, due either to flaky Bluetooth connections, low quality components, or the keyboard requiring a keypress to wake from sleep. A secondary one is that they require batteries or recharging of their internal battery periodically, but that period is a few months long. Lastly, Bluetooth pairing can be tricky, especially if you try to use the same keyboard with multiple devices.\n\nAfter trying out and being disappointed by the typing experience on the Apple and Logitech Smart Connector keyboards, I went back to my favorite keyboard of recent years, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016QO64FI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B016QO64FI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;linkId=fe064dbc2ef2450d6b735c756c6c8912\">Apple Magic Keyboard</a>.
