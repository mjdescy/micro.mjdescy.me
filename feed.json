Its web player is great, it has apps for many platforms if you want them, and it can be streamed from third-party Internet radio apps as well.\n\nI highly recommend giving it a try.\n",

Unfortunately, the world, I am afraid, still values the glib and quick over the thoughtful and slow.\n\n\n[^1]:\t[The calls are coming from inside the house.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCallsAreComingFromInsideTheHouse)\n",

				"title": "🎧 Sony WH-1000M4 headphones are just OK and that sucks",
				"content_html": "<p>Listening to the AirPods Max for five minutes in an Apple Store ruined me for other noise-canceling headphones. Not because they sounded good. In fact, I listened to them only long enough to learn that they are bass heavy and exciting. What wowed me about them was the active noise cancellation. It was far better than anything I had ever experienced. It made the din of the Apple Store—all those human voices, which are difficult for ANC to cancel out—go away completely.</p>\n<p>Sadly, they are $550 headphones (street price $479) that don’t even have an analog headphone jack, so they are both outside my price range and unsuitable–at least for me—for listening to lossless quality audio. Still, I wanted “industry leading” active noise cancellation, something better than I already have in my fancy <a href=\"https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/us/headphones/beoplay-h9\">Beoplay H9</a>, for the times that I need it.</p>\n<p>I read a lot of ANC headphone reviews and came to the conclusion that most reviewers recommend the Sony WH-1000M4 for its sound, excellent noise cancellation, and price. At $300 (street price $279) they are not cheap, but one could buy them <em>and</em> the AirPods Pro for cheaper than the AirPods Max (at its list price). Also, compared to the AirPods Max, the Sony WH-1000M4 is lighter, folds into a small, protective case, and has a headphone jack for wired listening.</p>\n<p>I received them and immediately discovered that I don’t love them. They are <em>fine</em>, but that is disappointing to me. Perhaps they are overhyped by reviewers. Perhaps I am asking too much from them. For whatever reason, I, unlike most people, I guess, think they fall short of greatness.</p>\n<p>This is my list of complaints that should serve as a counterpoint to all the glowing, uncritical reviews.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They sound good, but not great. The nearest analog to them that I own is another Bluetooth ANC headphone, the Beoplay H9, which sounds punchier, tighter, brighter, and more exciting than the Sony WH-1000M4. I have three non-Bluetooth headphones that sound better than both the Beoplay and the Sony, too<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>. I have tried to EQ the Sony via its iOS app, but I have found no preset that I constantly prefer.</li>\n<li>The active noise cancellation has an audible hiss and creates a bit of ear pressure. The hiss is disappointing. You don’t notice it during music, and probably won’t notice it in loud conditions where I would use these headphones, but it is annoying during podcasts or TV shows.</li>\n<li>Active noise cancellation does not live up to the hype. I actually use ANC headphones a lot in my home office because they remove the drone from the window air conditioner I use when it gets hot. Sadly, I found that the Sony WH-1000M4, with its industry-leading ANC, blocks that noise no better than the Beoplay H9, which is an also-ran in the ANC space and has essentially no passive noise cancellation in its earcup design.</li>\n<li>They aren’t that comfortable.

				"content_text": "Listening to the AirPods Max for five minutes in an Apple Store ruined me for other noise-canceling headphones. Not because they sounded good. In fact, I listened to them only long enough to learn that they are bass heavy and exciting. What wowed me about them was the active noise cancellation. It was far better than anything I had ever experienced. It made the din of the Apple Store—all those human voices, which are difficult for ANC to cancel out—go away completely. \n\nSadly, they are $550 headphones (street price $479) that don’t even have an analog headphone jack, so they are both outside my price range and unsuitable–at least for me—for listening to lossless quality audio. Still, I wanted “industry leading” active noise cancellation, something better than I already have in my fancy [Beoplay H9](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/us/headphones/beoplay-h9), for the times that I need it.\n\nI read a lot of ANC headphone reviews and came to the conclusion that most reviewers recommend the Sony WH-1000M4 for its sound, excellent noise cancellation, and price. At $300 (street price $279) they are not cheap, but one could buy them *and* the AirPods Pro for cheaper than the AirPods Max (at its list price). Also, compared to the AirPods Max, the Sony WH-1000M4 is lighter, folds into a small, protective case, and has a headphone jack for wired listening. \n\nI received them and immediately discovered that I don’t love them. They are *fine*, but that is disappointing to me. Perhaps they are overhyped by reviewers. Perhaps I am asking too much from them. For whatever reason, I, unlike most people, I guess, think they fall short of greatness. \n\nThis is my list of complaints that should serve as a counterpoint to all the glowing, uncritical reviews. \n\n1. They sound good, but not great. The nearest analog to them that I own is another Bluetooth ANC headphone, the Beoplay H9, which sounds punchier, tighter, brighter, and more exciting than the Sony WH-1000M4. I have three non-Bluetooth headphones that sound better than both the Beoplay and the Sony, too[^1]. I have tried to EQ the Sony via its iOS app, but I have found no preset that I constantly prefer.\n2. The active noise cancellation has an audible hiss and creates a bit of ear pressure. The hiss is disappointing. You don’t notice it during music, and probably won’t notice it in loud conditions where I would use these headphones, but it is annoying during podcasts or TV shows.\n3. Active noise cancellation does not live up to the hype. I actually use ANC headphones a lot in my home office because they remove the drone from the window air conditioner I use when it gets hot. Sadly, I found that the Sony WH-1000M4, with its industry-leading ANC, blocks that noise no better than the Beoplay H9, which is an also-ran in the ANC space and has essentially no passive noise cancellation in its earcup design. \n4. They aren’t that comfortable. My biggest problem with the BeoPlay H9 that I already had is its hard headband, which hurts my head after a while. The Sony headband does the same thing, despite the headphone being lighter and the headband being covered with softer material. The AirPods Max headband is very comfortable, but its clamping force borders on the extreme, so I probably would find it uncomfortable, too.\n5. While their moving parts are silent, the faux leather ear cups creak and squeak when I move my head. It is infuriating. I have no other headphones that do this.\n\nI probably should have returned the Sony WH-1000M4 while I still had the chance. While I do expect to use them during walks on the treadmill and for plane travel in the future, I find that I almost always choose the Beoplay H9 over them for my everyday home-office-with-the-air-conditioner-on listening.\n\n\n[^1]:\tI realize that part of my problem is that I have too many audiophile-quality headphones already. If I were comparing the Sony WH-1000M4 with my aging (non-Pro) AirPods, I would probably think they sound great. \n",

I liked the near lack of graphics and other nonsense on the screen.\n\nThe announcers were sporadically good, but sometimes they were so far off topic that they didn’t bother to call the game. At times they were so caught up in their own conversation that it reminded me of watching meaningless late-season games between teams with no chance of making the playoffs. I bet the announcers got a bunch of notes about this already and will try to stay more focused on the games going forward.\n\n",

He will probably have occasional nightmares about death—or at least have trouble falling asleep with worry about it. While it makes me sad to see my son start to go through this phase—and it has certainly led to some difficult dinner conversations—I know that he, like my daughter, is an emotionally healthy kid and will be fine. I expect him to think about death some more, talk about it with us, and become more emotionally mature through the process. He’s going to get through this; we all do.\n\nIt is quite a burden to understand that you, someday, are going to die. I wish I could ease that burden for my children, but I am wise enough to know that I cannot.\n\n",

I’m sure that *New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe* *is* a good game, but it is not a good game for me. I am not sure I will ever play the game again after I beat it.\n\n",

While I did not re-read every essay I ever wrote for school during this process, I did notice something in my files that surprised me: From my junior year of high school to my final semester of grad school, I created outlines—full <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)\">sentence outlines</a><sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>—for all of my papers that were over a few pages in length.

It was a requirement of my grade 10 English thesis project, which was a 10-page research and literary criticism paper. At the time, I understood how to create high-level outlines pretty well, but could not understand why I would create an outline that contained full sentences of the essay I was trying to write. I figured that if I could write a sentence outline for an essay, I could just as easily (or more easily) write the essay itself. In grade 10, that is precisely what I did: I wrote the essay and then split apart every paragraph and every sentence into a hierarchical outline. In doing so, I learned almost nothing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-last-english-thesis-project-wherein-i-mastered-the-sentence-outline\">My last English thesis project, wherein I mastered the sentence outline</h2>\n<p>For my final English thesis project, my senior honors thesis in English at Brandeis University, I resorted to a sentence outline to solve my writer’s block. It was a year-long, independent study project, and my thesis advisor—who mostly told me that despite my anxiety I was doing fine—was not terribly helpful or available. Understandably, I lacked direction. I had no idea how to write a big, scary, and academically significant 80-100 page essay. When I sat down to write, I would either produce a jumbled mess of thoughts and quotations that did not fit together, or I would compose a coherent paragraph that I could not connect to anything else I wrote. As my senior year went by, I felt as if I was falling further and further behind my brilliant, thesis-writing peers. Counterintuitively (or understandably, depending on how you look at it), this feeling of dread led me to procrastinate instead of write.</p>\n<p>In the early spring, I realized that if I created an outline, I could work on my big, scary thesis essay without actually writing it. To that end, I split the work that had been going nowhere into two Word documents: (1) a simple, high-level outline that consisted of just a few headings at the start; and (2) an unorganized junk drawer of ideas and quotations from my source material. Outlining quickly became a productive form of procrastination for me. Instead of writing my essay, I would pluck out ideas from my junk-drawer document and drop them into the outline. From there, I would change these ideas, move them around, flesh them out, add to them, or delete them, all without committing to their precise wording or location. Because these ideas were all sentences or block quotes, my outline necessarily became a sentence outline.</p>\n<p>Using keyboard shortcuts I no longer remember, I collapsed sections and paragraphs of my thesis outline and moved them up and down to organize my ideas, and I shifted individual sentences up and down to make my arguments clearer and easier to understand. Because I was avoiding the writing phase of my project, I avoided gluing my sentences together with logical-, narrative-, or stylistic flow until I felt sure they were in the right place in the document and in the right order in their paragraph. Doing so took some time to get used to, but granted me a feeling of tremendous freedom as I worked out the essay’s high-level structure and the fleshed out the arguments I was advancing within it.</p>\n<p>I didn’t realize until I was finalizing my thesis—when my outline was a 100-page outline full of section headings, topic sentences, and body sentences organized into paragraph-level nodes—that I was doing <em>exactly</em> what I was supposed to do. I had organized my research and my findings in a format that was incredibly flexible, and I was constantly revising it and shaping it into something coherent. By accident, I had finally learned why a sentence outline is useful: It explodes an essay into individual thoughts that are physically separate<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> and logically atomic<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup>. Doing so makes it easier to evaluate each one independently and—with a good word processor—to quickly group, ungroup, reorder, and move them into place.</p>\n<p>In the end, I never wrote my thesis paper. Instead, over the course of a few months, I wrote a sentence outline. I converted it to a manuscript only a day or two before I turned in the final draft. My only edits to it, in manuscript form, were related to applying Word styles to the various paragraphs and adding a title page. The <a href=\"https://mjdescy.me/pdf/new-directions-thesis.pdf\">final draft</a> must have been pretty good because it was awarded the Doris Brewer Cohen Award for best senior honors undergraduate thesis in the humanities at Brandeis University.</p>\n<h2 id=\"in-grad-school-and-beyond\">In grad school and beyond</h2>\n<p>I went to business school after college, and did not have to write nearly as many long papers to earn my M.B.A. as I did to earn my undergraduate English degree. Despite the small number of major papers I wrote, and despite not remembering the writing process I followed for them, I discovered that I wrote sentence outlines for each one.</p>\n<p>After grad school, almost all of my long-form writing has been technical writing for work. While I do not have any old drafts lying around, I recall using outlines extensively to plan and structure my work, but I never again used sentence outlines to draft and perfect it. One reason for that may be that I used different software to write with: mostly plaintext editors, rarely Word (not until I had a first draft nearly completed), and never a dedicated outliner like OmniOutliner. Another reason is that much of my technical writing had to fit into pre-existing document templates that already consisted of many short sections laid out in a specific, required order.</p>\n<p>After discovering my longer-than-remembered history of using sentence outlines, and reminiscing about the senior honors thesis project on which I mastered the use of them, I now wonder if I should go back to using them for my larger writing projects.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>A sentence outline is an outline in which every single sentence of an essay is included, not just topic headings.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>There is vertical space between them.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:2\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:3\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>They are the smallest unit of the essay, and can be composed into different forms, or paragraphs, as needed.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:3\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n",

The [final draft](https://mjdescy.me/pdf/new-directions-thesis.pdf) must have been pretty good because it was awarded the Doris Brewer Cohen Award for best senior honors undergraduate thesis in the humanities at Brandeis University.\n\n## In grad school and beyond\nI went to business school after college, and did not have to write nearly as many long papers to earn my M.B.A. as I did to earn my undergraduate English degree. Despite the small number of major papers I wrote, and despite not remembering the writing process I followed for them, I discovered that I wrote sentence outlines for each one.\n\nAfter grad school, almost all of my long-form writing has been technical writing for work. While I do not have any old drafts lying around, I recall using outlines extensively to plan and structure my work, but I never again used sentence outlines to draft and perfect it. One reason for that may be that I used different software to write with: mostly plaintext editors, rarely Word (not until I had a first draft nearly completed), and never a dedicated outliner like OmniOutliner. Another reason is that much of my technical writing had to fit into pre-existing document templates that already consisted of many short sections laid out in a specific, required order.\n\nAfter discovering my longer-than-remembered history of using sentence outlines, and reminiscing about the senior honors thesis project on which I mastered the use of them, I now wonder if I should go back to using them for my larger writing projects.\n\n[^1]:\tA sentence outline is an outline in which every single sentence of an essay is included, not just topic headings.\n\n[^2]:\tThere is vertical space between them.\n\n[^3]:\tThey are the smallest unit of the essay, and can be composed into different forms, or paragraphs, as needed.\n",

It was about a rower who was pulled out to sea one evening by the ocean tide. He rowed and rowed all night and kept being pulled farther and father from land by the ebbing tide. In the morning, however, the direction of the tide reversed, and he was pushed back to the shore to safety.</p>\n<p>I remember this story so vividly because I had to write a very short essay about the book in my A.P.

The teacher stressed how important it was for this assignment to be brief; only one page and three paragraphs.</p>\n<p>I chose to answer the last question by writing about the story of the rower. Unfortunately, my explanation of the rower’s story stretched to two whole paragraphs, making my essay far longer than the one-page limit. At that time in my life, I had no idea how to pare down my writing even if it meant cutting parts of it I liked. I agonized over how to cut it down, but decided, uneasily, to turn it in as it was, despite it exceeding the one-page limit.</p>\n<p>Happily, my overlong essay was a big success. I may have I understood the story of the rower better than even the teacher did, because the day after I turned it in he began the class but projecting my essay—all two pages of it—onto the classroom’s pull-down screen, and asking the whole class to read it. He seemed genuinely touched by it, too.</p>\n<p>This evening I pulled the essay out of my archives to reproduce below. The last two paragraphs are about the rower.

The life of a writer can be dark and lonely, demanding much introspection and many late nights alone with an unruly manuscript. The writing process itself is difficult beyond most people&rsquo;s conceptions. It is so harrowing, so haphazard, and so time consuming that most people that have one burning idea for a particular novel or story are never able to actually follow through its capitalization. Most never really even start, and the few who do often form such an attachment to their work, because it was so hard for them to accomplish, they will not allow themselves to alter it in any way, even to tie up loose ends or discard the beginnings of dropped themes and plot turns. Thus, their piece is never perfected; their dream is left to waste. Despite all these trials, however, writing is a very rewarding activity. Writing is like a passion eating at you, an aching, a hunger that can kill if not satiated. Only persistence, slogging through the murk and endless toil of the process, will enable one to fulfill his dream.</p>\n<p>A dominant tone of the work can be described as enthusiastic. Dillard is intense as she explains the writing process. She describes writing in exhilarating terms, comparing it to playing tennis, lion taming, and stunt flying. Her metaphors are powerful, zesty. She shows your work as a line of words pulsing through your bloodstream and shooting across the universe. She tells us committing a vision to paper is a futile fight with the jealous, tyrannical page, the forces of time and matter working against you. Her chapters are choppy, broken down into many vignettes and tiny observations. There is a break on almost every page. They are so frequent each seems to be a gasp of breath between her quickly blurted images.</p>\n<p>A strong scene that feels as though it will provide a good doorway for thoughtful attention to an important aspect of the work is the story of Ferrar Burn, which her painter friend, Paul Glenn, told her. One evening, years ago, Ferrar Burn caught sight of an eight-foot log of Alaska cedar floating out in the channel by his house. It was high tide, the water slack, so he rowed out, tied the log to his little eight-foot pram, and proceeded to tow it in. The tide turned, however, catching him, pulling him farther and farther out to sea. But Burn kept rowing against the tide, stubbornly, obstinately towards his house. He strained against it all night to little avail. When the tide finally changed the next morning, it finally pushed the still-rowing Ferrar Burn back home.</p>\n<p>This scene connects very well to the aforementioned theme. Through persistence against terrible odds, the rower Burn was finally able to succeed. Had he given up, stopped rowing, he would have drifted so far out to sea that the tide change which eventually pulled him back in would not have helped him. A writer too must pull against opposing forces to accomplish his or her goal. There is much about the process that pushes people away. Most would just assume go along with the tide, take the easy route, and be led far away from their dream. But the few with the dogged insistence to stick with their craft, pull through their troubles, and never lose sight of their objectives are able to ride out the tough times and sail swiftly and smoothly through the good times.

It may be my favorite Bond movie now, or at least sit in my personal top three list alongside _ From Russia with Love_ and _The Spy Who Loved Me_.\n\n",

I said I thought she had a flat tire (it turns out she did), and I told her to park in the nearest parking lot and wait for me to get her.

				"title": "A rebuilding year",
				"content_html": "<p>A real “rebuilding year” is when a sports team is broken down and reassembled, basically from scratch, after—and as a response to—a dreadful season. 2020 was a dreadful season for, well, everyone on earth due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It certainly was for me. I experienced some deep trauma back in 2018 when my father died, which I thought went away after a few months, but never really did. Watching my father die (of Alzheimers and old age) completely messed me up. The emerging pandemic in early 2020 let the lingering feelings I had from that time metastasize into full-blown depression and anxiety. Work and home life were both stressful to me all the time. My relationships with everybody suffered. I was a wreck. So was everyone else at the time, which blinded me to how much of a mess I was. At some point, my eyes slowly opened to what was really going on with me, mental-health wise. My problem was that once I realized that my brain wasn’t working right (as in, rationally), I could not trust any of my thoughts, even the ones that could lead me to getting better. It took me months to figure out how to get help, even though, in hindsight, it wasn’t really that hard. By the end of 2020, I was well on the way to recovering from my mental health problems, but I hadn’t rebuilt my life yet.</p>\n<p>2021 has been a rebuilding year for me, pretty much from its first day. I made it a point to reach out to people. At work, I set up one-on-one meetings with everybody in my department, and asked for coaching sessions from people higher than me in the organization. At home, I made efforts to listen and to be more present in my relationships with my family members. Internally, I tried to be less hard on myself. I gave up some activities that were productive but stressful. I decided to write a blog entry every day. I allowed myself to waste time on mindless fun, like just listening to music or playing video games, after the kids were in bed (or supposed to be in bed, at least). I had thought that I would get the COVID vaccine and society would get back to normal. Of course, that hasn’t quite happened yet, but I am optimistic that next year will be the time when masking and social distancing pretty much go away. (I’m aware that a lot of people don’t wear masks when they go out, but my wife and kids wear masks at school for hours and hours each day, so masking and social distancing are very much going strong for my family.)</p>\n<p>Over the course of this rebuilding year, I have re-learned what I love to do, which I had forgotten over the past few years: Break complex things down to make them understandable; ask big, deep (or maybe dumb) questions; and to communicate ideas, especially in writing.</p>\n<p>I am both doing less than I used to and doing more. I am programming less and writing more. I made it a point to improve my presentation skills, and I did that. I taught myself how to make better slides, even though it was very challenging at first, and how to rehearse and revise a talk until it is brisk and concise. I have given …five or more presentations at work this year, on department-level and company-level Webex calls. I created a slide deck for our managing partner to present to the board of directors. I am getting more well known for my technical skills and presentation skills at work, too, which makes me feel great about my job for the first time in years. I also made it a point to write an article for my company’s newsletter, and I am about 85% done with that now, and plan to wrap it up next week. Lastly, I learned to type in the Colemak-DH layout on an unusual, ortholinear keyboard (still really slowly, I admit), and that proved to me that my brain was flexible enough to do it. I am literally rewiring my brain.</p>\n<p>By the end of the year, I will not be rebuilt, but will keep rebuilding. That is the most important thing I learned this year.</p>\n",

I had thought that I would get the COVID vaccine and society would get back to normal. Of course, that hasn’t quite happened yet, but I am optimistic that next year will be the time when masking and social distancing pretty much go away. (I’m aware that a lot of people don’t wear masks when they go out, but my wife and kids wear masks at school for hours and hours each day, so masking and social distancing are very much going strong for my family.)\n\nOver the course of this rebuilding year, I have re-learned what I love to do, which I had forgotten over the past few years: Break complex things down to make them understandable; ask big, deep (or maybe dumb) questions; and to communicate ideas, especially in writing. \n\nI am both doing less than I used to and doing more. I am programming less and writing more. I made it a point to improve my presentation skills, and I did that. I taught myself how to make better slides, even though it was very challenging at first, and how to rehearse and revise a talk until it is brisk and concise. I have given …five or more presentations at work this year, on department-level and company-level Webex calls. I created a slide deck for our managing partner to present to the board of directors. I am getting more well known for my technical skills and presentation skills at work, too, which makes me feel great about my job for the first time in years. I also made it a point to write an article for my company’s newsletter, and I am about 85% done with that now, and plan to wrap it up next week. Lastly, I learned to type in the Colemak-DH layout on an unusual, ortholinear keyboard (still really slowly, I admit), and that proved to me that my brain was flexible enough to do it. I am literally rewiring my brain.\n\nBy the end of the year, I will not be rebuilt, but will keep rebuilding. That is the most important thing I learned this year.\n\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Barbara Sprunt reports for <em>NPR</em> today:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sen. Joe Manchin has announced he cannot yet support the $1.75 trillion framework for President Biden&rsquo;s social spending package that congressional Democrats were hoping to push through this week.</p>\n<p>“I will not support a bill that is this consequential without thoroughly understanding the impact that it will have on our national debt, our economy and, most importantly, all of our American people,&quot; the West Virginia Democrat said in a statement Monday afternoon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I feel like she could have written this article any day this year, since Joe Biden was inaugurated. Sen. Joe Manchin is destined to be the Joe Lieberman of 2021. Like Lieberman, who killed the ACA’s “public option” to protect his insurance company donors in Connecticut, Manchin will be responsible for neutering the most impactful legislation since the ACA, all because of a price tag that is (1) going to be spread out over a decade; (2) will represent a tiny percentage of GDP over that period; and (3) has been cut in half since this spring. Point 1 is just the standard Republican talking points about any kind of spending that isn’t a tax cut.</p>\n<p>This rigamarole has gone so long that I don’t think the Democrats can reach him with any kind of progressive legislation. It is dangerous to anger him too much over this, too, because he could flip parties, and then the Democrats would lose the Senate. Overall, he is an untrustworthy person to negotiate with. As for the similarly “centrist” Kyrsten Sinema, she is at a whole other level of incomprehensibility, and could still be a spoiler to the Democrats even if Manchin eventually agrees to some bill. Neither one of them are fighting for anything of value for their constituents.

				"content_text": "Barbara Sprunt reports for _NPR_ today:\n\n> Sen. Joe Manchin has announced he cannot yet support the $1.75 trillion framework for President Biden's social spending package that congressional Democrats were hoping to push through this week.\n> \n> “I will not support a bill that is this consequential without thoroughly understanding the impact that it will have on our national debt, our economy and, most importantly, all of our American people,\" the West Virginia Democrat said in a statement Monday afternoon.\n\nI feel like she could have written this article any day this year, since Joe Biden was inaugurated. Sen. Joe Manchin is destined to be the Joe Lieberman of 2021. Like Lieberman, who killed the ACA’s “public option” to protect his insurance company donors in Connecticut, Manchin will be responsible for neutering the most impactful legislation since the ACA, all because of a price tag that is (1) going to be spread out over a decade; (2) will represent a tiny percentage of GDP over that period; and (3) has been cut in half since this spring. Point 1 is just the standard Republican talking points about any kind of spending that isn’t a tax cut. \n\nThis rigamarole has gone so long that I don’t think the Democrats can reach him with any kind of progressive legislation. It is dangerous to anger him too much over this, too, because he could flip parties, and then the Democrats would lose the Senate. Overall, he is an untrustworthy person to negotiate with. As for the similarly “centrist” Kyrsten Sinema, she is at a whole other level of incomprehensibility, and could still be a spoiler to the Democrats even if Manchin eventually agrees to some bill. Neither one of them are fighting for anything of value for their constituents. I would be surprised if they remain in office after their next elections, no matter what they do from this point forward. It’s hyperbole, of course, but I want to say: “Never has so much been lost for so little gain.”\n\n",

Is it fair to judge historical figures by today’s standards? These are important discussions to have in a history class.

He minced no words about it: there is no moral relativism when it came to slavery. It’s always wrong to subjugate others. Some things are simply <em>verboten</em>; it doesn’t matter what the society accepts or believes, or what the reasons are behind it. Even if we believe that most slaves were not subjected to frequent physical violence, as the other history teacher claimed, and even if we somehow believe slaver were treated very well, it does not forgive their subjugation, for that is psychological torture and is simply wrong.

The World</em></a> for the Nintendo Switch. It was an impulse purchase of a game I had not heard of and didn’t know was any good. I have been wanting to play a brawler for a while, but it is a genre I have not played since I was a kid, so I was not sure I would still enjoy it. I have been eyeing, but have been reluctant to spend $30 of $25 on, <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/river-city-girls-switch/\"><em>River City Girls</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/streets-of-rage-4-switch/\"><em>Streets of Rage 4</em></a> for weeks now. I haven’t played a game in that genre since I was a kid, and as an adult I am terrible at a lot of the games I used to excel at (I’m looking at you, Mario!) so I was not sure if I could button-mash fast enough to play such games. $25 or more is too much to spend on a game that is too hard for me to play. While I dithered about a purchase, I spent some time playing NES versions of the <em>Double Dragon</em> games and <em>River City Ransom</em>, but found those games are too primitive to be much fun for me anymore.</p>\n<p>The Scott Pilgrim game was on sale for a stupidly low price ($7.49 or something), so I picked it up. To my surprise and delight, it is awesome. It has a colorful pixel art style that mimics the Scott Pilgrim comics. Its level design, character design, and animations show a lot of humor and attention to the source material. The chiptune soundtrack is really catchy. Play controls are easy to pick up. It starts out really hard, but you can replay levels to level up your character (i.e., lean new moves), and earn money to upgrade your character’s stats (strength, defense, etc.), which makes the game easier. It is kind of grind-y, at least for a conservative, low-skilled player like me, but the grind is fun.</p>\n<p>Basically, everything about the video game does justice to the source material. Playing it caused me to want to reread the graphic novels, which I started to do yesterday. <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>, in comics form, is weird, surreal, and a real mess—you know, a perfect reflection of the early twenties and late teens lives of its characters. The characters, plot, and themes of the book, are complex, messy, flawed, and not fully formed. Nobody is a role model. Nobody is mature. Reality itself is warped for them. It makes no sense that Scott goes into video game mode and <em>kills</em> his girlfriend’s exes. Is that a metaphor? Only kind of. You’re just not expected to take it seriously. It’s <em>all</em> problematic—like life, I guess. I don’t really think it is deep (maybe you would if you were much younger than me), but it is really good at stirring up complicated thoughts and emotions in me about how messy life is.

We hate the idea of sending our daughter into this environment with a vaccine, and also hate the idea of pulling her out of more school because being away so long already has not been good for her mental health. All of us are frustrated and exhausted by all of this, and there does not seem to be an end to the pandemic in sight.\n\n",

Everyone I know, including and especially myself—lives inside a rigid, repetitive routine: school, work, cooking, cleaning, a little leisure, maybe a vacation once or twice a year. Furthermore, I know that I, like some of Joyce’s characters, have chosen comfort over fulfillment—at least in terms of my career choices, and in some respects in terms of vacation travel as well. If I had taken more risks, perhaps I would have more money or status, and I might have made more of an impact on the world. My life, however, is nowhere near as bleak as the Dubliners Joyce writes about. I have a great family, a great home, and have done some great things I can be proud of. But it is chilling to think how repetitive everyday life is, and how much drudgery it entails; like Joyce’s characters in _Dubliners_ each of us is stuck in a loop.\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>One frequent and inescapable sight on the rural roads of New Hampshire is the Trump campaign sign. In every town, there are Trump campaign signs flanking the ends of driveways. Huge Trump/Pence billboards are proudly hoisted over the signs for legitimate businesses, presumably by the owners themselves. Trump flags—and the occasional anti-Biden flag—hang limply from the front of houses; some of them are accompanied by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again\">MAGA</a> battle <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lives_Matter#/media/File:Thin_Blue_Line_Flag_(United_States).svg\">flag</a>: the black-and-blue parody of the Stars and Stripes. This is unusual. Trump lost almost a year ago. In every other election I have lived through, all the campaign signs came down in short order. But in 2021, in every town I drive through, I pass by monument after monument to the loser.</p>\n<p>Celebrating a win for too long is gauche and sad. Mourning a loss, however old, is noble. This is especially true when that loss neatly dovetails into an even greater loss that the MAGA movement clearly draws its inspiration from: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy\">The Lost Cause</a>. They both stem from the very same great lies: “this [thing I don’t like] isn’t fair” and “my humiliation is your humiliation.”</p>\n<p>It is too soon to know if <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie#Trump's_false_claim_of_a_stolen_election\">The Big Lie</a> will have the weight and longevity of The Lost Cause.

				"content_text": "One frequent and inescapable sight on the rural roads of New Hampshire is the Trump campaign sign. In every town, there are Trump campaign signs flanking the ends of driveways. Huge Trump/Pence billboards are proudly hoisted over the signs for legitimate businesses, presumably by the owners themselves. Trump flags—and the occasional anti-Biden flag—hang limply from the front of houses; some of them are accompanied by the [MAGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again) battle [flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lives_Matter#/media/File:Thin_Blue_Line_Flag_(United_States).svg): the black-and-blue parody of the Stars and Stripes. This is unusual. Trump lost almost a year ago. In every other election I have lived through, all the campaign signs came down in short order. But in 2021, in every town I drive through, I pass by monument after monument to the loser.\n\nCelebrating a win for too long is gauche and sad. Mourning a loss, however old, is noble. This is especially true when that loss neatly dovetails into an even greater loss that the MAGA movement clearly draws its inspiration from: [The Lost Cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy). They both stem from the very same great lies: “this [thing I don’t like] isn’t fair” and “my humiliation is your humiliation.”\n\nIt is too soon to know if [The Big Lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie#Trump's_false_claim_of_a_stolen_election) will have the weight and longevity of The Lost Cause. It seems likely, though, that The Big Lie will simply get folded into The Lost Cause, remembered as yet another indignity in a long line. In that way, it can last, essentially, forever. \n\nThose Trump campaign signs can stay up forever, too, even after the former president runs again in 2024, retires from public life, or dies.

My wife tells me that my level of instruction would suit some grad students, maybe, but not high school students, and presumably not undergrads either. That is dispiriting to me, but she would know better than I—she knows teens and young adults and intimately knows the educational system they are put through.

We, as a student body, we asked—explicitly—to learn about, discuss, and work through new ideas together. It wasn’t supposed to be easy. It was supposed to be difficult. Difficulty was the whole point. Open debate was how it worked. That was liberal arts scholarship—and I’m pretty sure college campuses were thought to be politically-correct, liberal romper rooms even then, so maybe even I got the watered-down version.

Not every decision made on day one has to be carried out forever. As a potential contributor, I just like to know what I might expect if I approached the maintainer now.\n\n",

I’m glad I did.</p>\n<p>I thought the theatrical release of <em>Justice League</em> was pretty bad, but not quite as bad as the professional movie review consensus was. I figured that the Snyder cut must be better, but I was surprised at how much better it is. Granted, it still isn’t <em>good</em>. It doesn’t fix its pacing problems. It still is not as brisk and pleasurable as the best of the Marvel movies. It doesn’t tell a cohesive story, but it also crams in too many story lines for a non-DC fan to keep track of. It still has some dumb script problems, such every single part of the nonsensical museum height/terrorist bombing blot in the opening Wonder Woman scene, that could have been solved by editing a few sentences of dialog. While not exactly <em>good</em>, it is a good bad movie now. Its reach often exceeds its grasp, but it offers a lot of interesting material to people who are already fans. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to be the kind of movie that would bring a lot new fans in.</p>\n<p>It is now very clear to me that Zach Snyder’s vision was dark and wild and weird—definitely too much of all of those things to launch a successful franchise—but Joss Whedon’s contributions were just awful: tasteless, asinine, nonsensical, and insulting to the audience. Whedon’s dialog (notably Superman’s and The Flash’s) and the character moments he created, like the race between The Flash and Superman, are embarrassing to watch and make the characters seem stupid. Snyder’s cut simply had better dialog for them. Simply getting rid of the random <em>people</em> that Whedon put into that nuclear wasteland Russian city—the one that existed in the movie only to be destroyed in a bout of cinematic excess—made the climax bearable. Who needs to worry about a family who shouldn’t be living in a nuclear wasteland anyway when the entire world is already at stake? Whedon really did screw up that movie.</p>\n<p>I think that the Snyder Cut works very well for fans of the comics, especially fans of the “what-if” versions of all the famous characters. Some fans, like me, believe that comic book characters are archetypes, and really can be <em>anything</em>, and no representation of them is truly canonical. The grim, dark version of the Justice League is an interesting thought experiment, one of many worth exploring. It is not something I ever felt hung up on as “not the real version” of Superman or whatever. The Snyder Cut isn’t the real version of the DC Universe to me, because nothing is.

I have been watching the “Fullmetal Alchemist” anime series (there are two), mostly late at night, to unwind.</p>\n<p>I watched the entirety of “Fullmetal Alchemist”—which is the first anime adaptation of the manga—first. Because it veers widely off of the plot of the manga (which, since I am not a manga reader, I don’t care about), it seems to be widely considered the lesser of the two adaptations. I think that sells it short.

				"content_text": "While I have been working a ton lately, I can’t work every second of the day. I have been watching the “Fullmetal Alchemist” anime series (there are two), mostly late at night, to unwind.\n\nI watched the entirety of “Fullmetal Alchemist”—which is the first anime adaptation of the manga—first. Because it veers widely off of the plot of the manga (which, since I am not a manga reader, I don’t care about), it seems to be widely considered the lesser of the two adaptations.

I hope the engineers sacrificed looks for comfort there.\n\nAnd it's a shame they charge via Lightning  \n",

Coronavirus is in the air, and being indoors with an infected person for a prolonged time increases the viral load that one is exposed to.

The song plays each time the series’ protagonist Nadia (co-creator Natasha Lyonne) dies and returns to the same location – a bathroom at her 36th birthday party. Its use is similar to that of Sonny &amp; Cher&rsquo;s &ldquo;I Got You Babe&rdquo; from the 1993 film Groundhog Day.  Lyonne explained that in choosing the song she was struck by the &ldquo;buoyant doomsday quality&rdquo; of Nilsson&rsquo;s life. The cost of using the song so many times took up a significant portion of the music budget. His estate also limited how many times the song could be used.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reading this got me thinking about what nonsense music rights are for TV and movies. Why are song rights so expensive? Moreover, why should Nillson&rsquo;s estate be able to limit &ldquo;how many times the songs could be used? (Harry Nilsson died in 1994.) That sounds so frustrating to deal with. I don&rsquo;t understand why more TV producers don&rsquo;t just hire musicians to record cover versions and cut out, at the very least, the performance royalties. (I know this sometimes happens.

And yes, he is swiftly caught up in Lyra Belacqua’s journey north with the Gyptians to free the children taken by the Gobblers. But his personality and his role within the tonal framework of this story are nothing like the character in the books, which is likely not a byproduct of Miranda’s casting but rather the reason behind it.\n\n\"His Dark Materials\" is, mostly, a straight-ahead adaptation of \"Northern Lights,\" so the different take on the Lee Scoresby character surprised me. It took me a few minutes to warm up to his performance and take on the character, but, by the middle of the episode, I enjoyed it and was on board with wherever it would lead the series next.\n",

But some experts think that is only worsening the problem. “We see some evidence that there is specific targeting of organizations that have insurance,” said Kimberly Goody, a manager of financial crimes analysis for FireEye, a major cybersecurity firm, which says it has responded to twice as many ransomware attacks this year compared with 2018.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have two main observations about this section:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First, it is galling that the typical fix for ransomware attacks is to pay the ransom, and rely on the good faith of the bad actor who locked away all the data to actually restore the encrypted data. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Second, that attackers are targeting companies that have done the fiscally responsible thing and obtained cyberinsurance to mitigate their ransomware risks is a perverse form of <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_selection\">adverse selection</a>. I am sure the cyberinsurance industry is working out ways to incentivize their customers to reduce their ransomware risks, because that is what insurance companies do, but organizational inertia and lack of funding will make it difficult and time-consuming to succeed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ideally, companies and municipalities would keep their systems up to date through regular software packaging and hardware upgrades, and would inventory and back up their data, so that ransomware attacks would be less likely to succeed, and so that data could be restored without paying the ransom. Organizations could also reduce their attack surface in other ways, such as replacing Microsoft Windows with ChromeOS for classes of workers, such as call center workers, whose job functions do not require Microsoft Windows. ChromeOS is less likely to be attacked than Microsoft Windows, and its use would encourage centralized data storage and software, which are easier to keep up-to-date and secure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Beyond hardware and software upgrades, organizations need to train their employees to recognize social engineering attacks, as that is the number one or two attack vector every year. Having gone through that training every year for many years, and having been tested at random by a program at my company, I have learned that social engineering attacks can be almost impossible to discern from legitimate emails and instant messages. I think that no amount of social engineering training is going to be more than 80% effective at preventing phishing and/or ransomware attacks, but 80% is a good start.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The main reason organizations do not put these controls and practices into place is money. The second is organizational inertia. Both can be solved, but only through additional resources and external pressure.  As citizens and as customers, we have to demand that the organizations, both public and private, that we interact with, protect their data and our data sufficiently.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Unfortunately, the New York Times is trying to <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teach_the_Controversy\">teach the controversy</a>, when no such controversy actually exists.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here are some clarifying points about some of the topics discussed or touched upon in the article, from someone who actually follows a sensible, low calorie, vegetable-rich ketogenic diet:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>There is no \"Keto diet\". There are a variety of <em>ketogenic</em> diets, all with the common element that they tend to put the body in a state of <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis\">nutritional ketosis</a> at some point (not all day long unless you fast; primarily while you are sleeping). All these diets involve restricting carbohydrate intake to very low levels, ranging from 0 g to about 50 g per day. They differ in meal composition, meal timing, and what foods are allowed or disallowed. Also, in real life, even people on ketogenic diets will eat a high-carbohydrate treat now and then.</li><li>Nutritional ketosis is not the same as <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoacidosis\">ketoacidosis</a>.</li><li>Ideally, ketogenic diets involve eating a great deal of high fiber (but low starch) vegetables. Imagine telling your doctor that you eat two huge salads per day, with four ounces of meat on them, one ounce of cheese, and a tablespoon or two of olive-oil-and-vinegar dressing. Doctors have told me that it is hard to eat healthier than that.</li><li>Ketogenic diets are\"high fat\", on a <em>percentage basis</em>, not necessarily on an absolute basis (as in, grams of fat per day). </li><li>Similarly, ketogenic diets are not necessarily higher in meat or dairy consumption that the standard American diet.</li><li>I have read many, many abstracts and articles about diet and nutrition studies. Almost every study I have come across demonstrates bias or lack of understanding of what ketogenic diets actually look like (they tend not to restrict carbohydrates in test subjects sufficiently), relies on bad data (epidemiological data, or prior studies' data, self-reported food logs), or have durations that are too short (you need more than a couple weeks to assess a diet change). </li><li>Sometimes the scientists' own conclusions do not seem to be drawn from from the data they collected. This often evidences itself when the study concludes that, despite outcomes being equal or better for ketogenic diets, there is concern about their heart health due to the amount of fat in their diet.</li><li>While you may believe there is insufficient evidence that ketogenic diets are healthy (whatever that means), there is ample evidence that the standard American diet (which I understand has spread to most of the world at this point) is obviously not. It it were, there wouldn't be an obesity epidemic.</li><li>I don't believe it makes sense to adopt an all-meat, or all-meat-and-cheese, diet. My reasoning: Fermentation of high-fiber vegetable matter in the gut is something humans evolved to do, and, for that reason, it is probably a good idea to continue doing so. I would understand if this argument were made more clearly in the article; instead some scientist’s statement that mistakes \"high fiber\" foods with high carbohydrate foods (i.e. <em>starchy</em> foods) is there, casting doubt about about the diet in a way that doesn’t make logical sense.</li><li>Ketogenic diets are not appropriate for some people, due to underlying medical conditions such as Type I Diabetes. This does not mean that that are not appropriate for anybody.</li><li>In the end, we are all <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_of_1_trial\">n = 1 studies</a>. It doesn't matter what the science says about a diet's effect on study participants or on populations, it matters how the diet affects <em>you</em>. Many, many people have success with ketogenic diets that they did not have with low-fat diets or with calorie counting. If low-fat dieting or calories-in-calories-out tracking works for someone, it makes no sense to disparage that person’s diet choices, and almost no one would. Ketogenic diets should be treated the same way.<br></li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All in all, the article is 80% of good content with 20% of nonsense thrown in for the sake of balance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Buying different things changes the color of the card in the Wallet app, which is amusing. The colors correspond to the spending charts.\n8. I had a lot of trouble adding the card to my Apple Watch. It took lots of fiddling with settings, but, fortunately, I did not have to unpair and repair the Apple Watch to my iPhone.\n9. The titanium card is boring and heavy. I expect to never use it. Its best feature is that my card number is not printed on it.\n10. Some common features are missing: a website, integration with personal finance applications, and joint accounts (or authorized users).\n",

[This arcticle](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/arts/music/sleater-kinney-st-vincent.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=Arts), by Melena Rezwik, in the New York Times, provides some context _why_:\n\n> Since its self-titled 1995 debut, Sleater-Kinney has been revered as one of indie rock's most musically fierce and lyrically sharp bands, cutting a path for passionate musicians who refuse to check their politics or their emotions at the club door. The band’s signature sound — Brownstein and Tucker’s guitars and vocals winding around each other in stinging counterpoint, anchored by Weiss’s deft, thundering drumming — always relied on its precise chemistry. On the eve of its ninth studio album, Sleater-Kinney is now skimmed down to its founding duo, Tucker, 46, and Brownstein, 44.\n\nSleater-Kinney was a big part of the soundtrack to my 20s and early 30s. They were magnificent, and I am happy they are still making music, even if they are now down a member. I can't wait for their entire new album to drop on August 16.\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have found that my home server hobby is more a “moving files around” hobby. I have reached this conclusion based on the countless times I have found myself moving files from one place to another.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>My FreeNAS media server</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have run <a href=\"https://www.freenas.org\">FreeNAS</a> on a <a href=\"https://n40l.fandom.com/wiki/HP_MicroServer_N40L_Wiki\">HP N54L Microserver</a> for over five years. It has been a fantastic server. I bought it, a slightly used review unit, loaded with four 500 GB drives that it would not have normally come with, for a song—less than a new one with no storage drives included. Over the years, I updated the storage (now I have 16 TB total, with 8 TB usable space, set up in a single RAIDZ2 volume), and the RAM (from 8 GB to 16 GB). Over that same time period, 8 TB went from an impressive amount of storage to something a relatively inexpensive single drive could handle.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What those single drives don’t have, however, is redundancy and data integrity features. My little FreeNAS server has that, thanks to the ZFS file system. At several times in my home media streaming career, the external hard drive I used to store my media files died, and I lost all my data. Thankfully, no important personal data, like my photos, was ever lost, but the experience was upsetting enough not to want to repeat any more. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hard drive failures can happen to anyone, at any time, even if you have a nice server rather than a Raspberry Pi with an external hard drive attached via USB. Less than a year after I upgraded my FreeNAS server’s drives, one of them failed. The  FreeNAS server emailed me about the error, and its UI showed that my drive array was operating in a degraded state. I quickly ordered a new drive, swapped it out the next day, and never lost a bit of data. (I returned the failed drive for a free replacement, so now I have a replacement available, in case I ever need it.)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>File servers fill up, if you let them</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>FreeNAS has been stable, reliable, and a joy to use. One thing I have learned from running it, however, is that its file system, ZFS, degrades in performance when a volume (a pool of drives) is more than 80% full. FreeNAS will warn you about this threshold, but I never took it too seriously, because poor performance is mostly an academic concern when all you are doing with a server is transferring a few gigabytes a day. I do like to silence warnings, however, so I normally have to prune my media collection, or move some videos I want to keep, but am unlikely to watch again soon, to external, mostly cold, storage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course, where is that old, external drive with my files on it? I have no idea. So, this week, when my FreeNAS server filled up way over the 80% warning threshold, I decided, rather than continuing to free space by deleting movies and TV series that I didn’t want to delete, to add some more redundant storage to my network, and move the old files there. This decision was mostly based on having some extra hardware lying around, unused. I have a <a href=\"https://www.seagate.com/support/network-attached-storage/business-storage/seagate-nas/\">2 TB, two-bay Seagate NAS</a>, which is a little, Linux-based server with a consumer friendly web UI for administration. Unlike FreeNAS, it is very locked down, and unlike my HP microserver, it has only two drive bays rather than four.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At any rate, I set that up again and started moving some files to it, which sounds simpler than it really is. I am cherry picking files that are less likely to be accessed to the new server, so I have to go through everything I have, to some extent. Because the files either number in the thousands (like music files) or are multiple gigabytes in size (like video files), moving them has been very slow. Because the Seagate NAS’s filesystem (EXT4) is different than the FreeNAS filesystem (ZFS), there are other interesting problems, like file naming rules, that trip up file transfers. Because these are two different UNIX-like systems with different users configured on them, sometimes there are permissions issues that prevent files from being moved, renamed, or deleted. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As cool as it is to stream movies and music throughout my house, making it all work requires, from time to time, a lot of low-level file transfers. It has been taking a lot more time and attention than I would like.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

After some Google searches, I found a copy of a song that was one of my all-time, lost, never-had-it-on-a-proper-CD, never-could-get-it-anywhere songs: “<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/temporary/5980546?i=5980528\">Temporary</a>”. It wasn’t what I expected, however. It was a different arrangement, which was entirely unexpected.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I first heard “Temporary”, it was a power pop song, recorded by Mr. Right (or maybe just <a href=\"http://www.hartford.edu/hartt/about-us/faculty/music/music-industry/jim-chapdelaine.aspx\">Jim Chapdelaine</a>). Apparently, he dusted the song off almost ten years later to record with his new band, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/feathermerchants/featured\">Feathermerchants</a>, and reimagined it as a folk-rock (dare I say, Americana?) ballad, sung by a feather-light soprano. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I was seventeen, I recorded, with my high school band, an EP weeks before we all left for college. Due to dumb luck (one of our friends grew up next door to a bonafide music producer—and the knew each other), two of our four-song EP was recorded, mixed, and mastered by <a href=\"http://westhartfordmagazine.com/musician-husband-father-cancer-survivor/\">Jim Chapdelaine</a>, who went on to become a 13-time Emmy winner, among other amazing things. We first met up with him because his band at the time (in 1995), Mr. Right, played a gig at my hometown's annual fall festival on the green. My friends and I pretty much idolized him for a little while after high school graduation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jim played a recording of the original song through his board as we were waiting for something to happen—probably while we were waiting for our gold master CD to be written, at 1/2X speed, in Jim’s basement music studio. The chorus is an ear worm, and I really enjoy the lyric. I remembered it to this day, and hearing it made me feel nostalgic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

It is coded in Swift now, as opposed to Objective C, and has a much more mature, and hopefully easy to support, architecture.</p>\n<p>It will be a massive upgrade from version 3. While I would like to charge for it, even for my current customers, I feel bad enough about drastically changing an app I sold, even if it is for the better, that I am strongly considering just releasing it as a free upgrade. That&rsquo;s basically my plan for the next version of SwiftoDo on iOS, which will be based on this codebase as much as possible.</p>\n<p>My day job has been super interesting lately. I have hundreds of data analysis work papers to write, and I coded some pretty sophisticated scripts to generate all the data analytics I need to run, review, and report on. If only the software I was using made it easier to generate my work papers. I still have days and days of work ahead of me writing all the work papers that document the process. I also re-learned today about VBA’s superannuated support for interfaces, polymorphism, and delegation, for another project I am working on.</p>\n<p>My wife has been baking cookies for Purim this week, which is a lot of fun, but incredibly tempting to me, as I have been on a low-carb diet the past few weeks. I have to loose all the weight I gained over the past 14 months, due to stress- and grief-related overeating. I am using MyFitnessPal, once again, to track my eating.

				"content_text": "I have been working pretty steadily on finishing version 4.0 of SwiftoDo Desktop. I feel pretty good about the app, in general. It is coded in Swift now, as opposed to Objective C, and has a much more mature, and hopefully easy to support, architecture.\n\nIt will be a massive upgrade from version 3. While I would like to charge for it, even for my current customers, I feel bad enough about drastically changing an app I sold, even if it is for the better, that I am strongly considering just releasing it as a free upgrade. That's basically my plan for the next version of SwiftoDo on iOS, which will be based on this codebase as much as possible. \n\nMy day job has been super interesting lately. I have hundreds of data analysis work papers to write, and I coded some pretty sophisticated scripts to generate all the data analytics I need to run, review, and report on. If only the software I was using made it easier to generate my work papers. I still have days and days of work ahead of me writing all the work papers that document the process. I also re-learned today about VBA’s superannuated support for interfaces, polymorphism, and delegation, for another project I am working on.\n\nMy wife has been baking cookies for Purim this week, which is a lot of fun, but incredibly tempting to me, as I have been on a low-carb diet the past few weeks. I have to loose all the weight I gained over the past 14 months, due to stress- and grief-related overeating. I am using MyFitnessPal, once again, to track my eating. I have also been doing low-paced treadmill workouts in the evenings, though not every night. So far, my diet and exercise regime has gone really well, but sweets can still be tempting.\n\nOne new wrinkle in parenting that my family is dealing with is that my two-year-old son has recently developed separation anxiety, which is normal at his age. It has lead to a good deal of interrupted sleep late at night, when he wakes up and screams \"Mommy!\" My wife bears the brunt of it, though. He cries for her, but not for me.

(When was the last time we used the term secretary in the office to denote an \"administrative assistant”?)\n\nIf my daughter gets interested in computer science when she is older, I will definitely tell her about Evelyn Berezin in addition to the far more famous [Ada Lovelace](https://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/adalovelace/).\n",

				"content_text": "<h2>Files integration</h2>In late August I released a version of SwiftoDo that added sync support for any cloud data provider, via integration with the Files app. I think that this integration can be improved in the future. For example, right now, you cannot <em>create</em> a todo.txt file in the Files app using SwiftoDo, and you cannot open an existing todo.txt <em>from</em> the Files app.\n\nIf I add those features, I may as well rewrite the app’s UI, so that you have to create or open a file upon SwiftoDo’s launch. I would also have to rewrite how preferences are stored, so users could define different preferences for different files they open.\n\nThose changes would, I think, necessitate dropping the offline support features that currently exist—namely manual sync mode, and the failsafes in place for when automatic sync fails (typically due to network unavailability). I am actually not sure how other document-based apps on iOS handle things when network connectivity is lost or unavailable.

When they do happen, I would expect that the UI of the app would be changed pretty significantly.\n<h2>iOS 12 Support for SwiftoDo</h2>The current version of SwiftoDo runs on iOS 12 without incident. I have, however, compiled a new version of SwiftoDo on the iOS 12 SDK. It has no new features, but the SDK is newer, so it inherits upstream bug fixes from Apple, and I updated my codebase to Swift 4.2. I am dropping support for iOS 10.x, too, because iOS 12 will be released imminently, and it honestly makes no sense for anyone with an iOS device from the past four years or so not to upgrade to it (iOS 12 performance is that good). Because of the under-the-hood changes, and the dropped compatibility with iOS 10, I am bumping the version number to 3.0.0. (Don’t get too excited!)\n<h2>macOS Mojave Support for SwiftoDo Desktop</h2>I am running the MacOS Mojave beta, and have been testing out its new dark mode. I love dark mode, and it took me about two seconds to realize that dark mode support is not a nice-to-have—it is an absolute necessity. Therefore, have coded support for it in a new build of SwiftoDo Desktop. I will submit it to the App Store soon.\n\nThe next version of SwiftoDo Desktop will be compiled on the macOS 10.4 SDK, and will no longer support macOS versions lower than that. (If you are not going to upgrade to Mojave, you can continue to use the version of SwiftDo Desktop you are currently using, of course.)\n\nOther than dark mode support, there are no new features. (Sorry!) Because of the under-the-hood changes, and the change in minimum system requirements, I am bumping the version number to 3.0.0, though. (Again, don’t get too excited, but be happy your app is being supported.)\n<h2>The future of SwiftoDo Desktop</h2>It is a weird coincidence that SwiftoDo and SwiftoDo Desktop will be on the same version number for a while, but it is only a coincidence. At present, they do not share any underlying code.\n\nMy long term plan is for SwiftoDo to resemble, and share tons of code with, the iPad version of SwiftoDo. The approach I would prefer to take would be to use the joint iOS/macOS framework that Apple said is coming next year. I will probably continue work on improving the iOS version’s codebase in preparation for eventual macOS support as well.\n\nI am not sure if every user will want the iOS version on the desktop, but I know that <em>I</em> would.

The only reason I asked for it, and thought my family could afford it, was because it was damaged and was being sold at a steep discount.

I couldn’t tell you how good or bad the sound was. All I knew at the time is that it was amazing compared to what I had at the time: my mom’s 20-year-old transistor radio, and a cheap, toy-like boombox with a dual cassette deck. The most important upgrade, of course, was upgrading from records and tapes to CDs. CDs didn’t have tape hiss, had high dynamic range, and didn’t wear out over time or get eaten by the plater sometimes.</p>\n<p>I blasted music through this no-name system for hundreds of hours through middle school and high school. I measured my school papers by how many album listens it took to write them. I used it to practice singing, to transcribe songs with my guitar, to play back 4-track recordings, to lie back on my bed with CD liner notes while my favorite new song played on repeat.</p>\n<p>I amassed an enormous CD collection, mostly through the Columbia House and BMG Music clubs, and partly through weekly trips to my local record store (which is long gone now).</p>\n<p>Now that I’m a parent, I am amazed that all my loud music playing didn’t drive my parents crazy. They never complained to me about my music blasting from 3 PM to 10 PM every day. My kids are too little to listen to music on their own, but I’m already thinking about which headphones to get them, so we can all coexist in the house.</p>\n<p>I have no idea where this system went or who made it, but, based on it being my first CD player, it is probably the most important speaker system I have ever owned.</p>\n",

I also told my parents I would listen to classical music on it, which was my intent, but didn’t actually happen too often.\n\nIt came with two bookshelf speakers with RCA inputs that plugged in the rear, that I set up about ten feet away from the receiver. I couldn’t tell you how good or bad the sound was. All I knew at the time is that it was amazing compared to what I had at the time: my mom’s 20-year-old transistor radio, and a cheap, toy-like boombox with a dual cassette deck. The most important upgrade, of course, was upgrading from records and tapes to CDs. CDs didn’t have tape hiss, had high dynamic range, and didn’t wear out over time or get eaten by the plater sometimes.\n\nI blasted music through this no-name system for hundreds of hours through middle school and high school. I measured my school papers by how many album listens it took to write them. I used it to practice singing, to transcribe songs with my guitar, to play back 4-track recordings, to lie back on my bed with CD liner notes while my favorite new song played on repeat.\n\nI amassed an enormous CD collection, mostly through the Columbia House and BMG Music clubs, and partly through weekly trips to my local record store (which is long gone now).\n\nNow that I’m a parent, I am amazed that all my loud music playing didn’t drive my parents crazy. They never complained to me about my music blasting from 3 PM to 10 PM every day. My kids are too little to listen to music on their own, but I’m already thinking about which headphones to get them, so we can all coexist in the house.\n\nI have no idea where this system went or who made it, but, based on it being my first CD player, it is probably the most important speaker system I have ever owned.\n",

In many cases, it is designed to look and feel indistinguishable from a genuine attack. Whether you believe what you are saying or not is often immaterial because the impact is the same — and you are responsible for it, regardless of how funny you think it is.\n</blockquote>\n\nI think that there is a fundamental misunderstanding of trolling. It isn't a joke. It isn't done <em>for the lulz</em>. \"It's just a joke\" is an <em>obvious cover</em> for bad behavior. \n\nIt reminds me of an episode from my youth. In high school I had a friend who had a stash of <em>Playboy</em> magazines that he got (I think) from an older brother. Somehow we found out about them, demanded to see them, and teased him about them as we thumbed through them together. \"Why do you have these\" we would ask, teasingly, knowing full well why he had them. My friend's face would grow bright red and we would stammer: \"because they're so funny\". When pressed, he would double down on it: he would swear, up and down, that he had them because they were <em>hilarious</em>. Sure they were.\n\nIt puzzles me, why we act as if it's even possible that verbal abuse on the internet is \"just a joke\". A decent response to \"it was just a joke\" is \"it doesn't matter\".\n\n<blockquote>\nThe biggest mistake we ever made with trolls was making the question of abuse about how to placate and fix them instead of how to empower the people they hurt or manage your own well-being in the face of them. Like so many abused people, we thought the solutions involved walking on eggshells and not provoking them back. But instead, we must acknowledge “that we are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about who we pretend to be.” And that means acknowledging the awful, terrifying power of jokes and the immunity we seek in “not being serious.” This is exactly why people troll in the first place. Because deep down, they know it’s serious, and that’s exactly why it makes them feel powerful.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the online world, people who violate community standards should be banned from those communities. Gathering spaces online are not public spaces: almost all of them are owned by private companies or individuals.

I’m happy with what I am doing now, and thought I would document it in case anyone else wanted help understanding how to use the Pinboard effectively, especially if their usage lapsed, as mine did.\n\n<h2>What is Pinboard?</h2>\n\nPinboard is an “antisocial” cloud bookmarking service. You can keep all your bookmarks there and use its barebones website or third party apps and browser extensions, all using an open API, to access them. It’s a paid service, run by a single person, with a clear and straightforward business model. When I signed up, I pre-paid for ten years of service. Part of my impetus for using it again now, after having abandoned it for, well, nothing, is the sunk-cost fallacy. The other, more important part of that impetus is that I really like the simplicity and speed of Pinboard, and I like the Pinboard iOS client I use, <a href=\"http://pinnerapp.net\">Pinner</a>.\n\n<h2>What do I use it for?</h2>\n\nI use it for three things:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>To host my bookmarks in a cross-platform, always accessible way. I can get to the same bookmarks in Safari on my Mac and iOS, and in Chrome on Windows.</li>\n\t<li>For research and archival purposes, especially for programming projects I am working on. I can search these bookmarks on keywords, title, or description to review <em>the best</em> of the web pages I previously read on a topic of interest.</li>\n\t<li>As part of a homegrown “read it later” service. I can send article URLs to Pinboard from various apps, and read them later using Pinboard’s website, an app or browser extension on my Mac, and an app on iOS or Andriod.</li>\n</ol>\n\nNumber 3 used to be the <em>primary</em> purpose of Pinboard to me. I had signed up as part of an effort to get replace Pocket with something more privacy focused. After many years of using <a href=\"https://getpocket.com\">Pocket</a> (formerly “Read It Later”) to collect articles I was interested in from the huge stream of RSS feeds I parsed every day, I wanted a change. Primarily, this was because I became uncomfortable with Pocket’s business model: Why was it free? How did they really make money? What were they doing will all the data they collected on me? \n\nI also wasn’t crazy about some of the UI changes made to Pocket over the years. I wanted more control over the reading experience, too, which is something that using a web service with an open API would give me. It helps that, at the time, <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-use-reader-view-safari-iphone-and-ipad\">Safari’s Reader View</a> debuted, and I thought it was fantastic.\n\nI was pretty obsessive about channeling all the articles I read through Pinboard, so I had a one-way workflow from discovery to reading to marking read. I never deleted anything from Pinboard, either. I thought I wanted a history of all the articles I ever read, in case I wanted to search through that history later. (Of course, I never did that.)\n\n<h2>Why did I stop using it?</h2>\n\nI stopped using Pinboard for three main reasons:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>I started reading Twitter <em>more</em> than actual articles linked to from it. The constantly updating timeline was incredibly addictive, and less mentally taxing to follow than reading complex articles from actual publications. (I have since given up Twitter because it was <em>too</em> addictive for me to handle responsibly.)</li>\n\t<li>My wife and I had kids, meaning that I no longer had a bunch of downtime after dinner to catch up on all the articles I had bookmarked to read later. I would still send stuff to Pinboard to read later, but I would never actually read the articles.</li>\n\t<li>My wife and I subscribed to <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>The New York Times</em>, and <em>The Washington Post</em>. I started reading from those publications, from their apps, a lot more than scouring RSS feeds for articles from a dozen sources. Reading from their apps did not fit very well with my Pinboard workflow.</li>\n</ol>\n\nOverall, Pinboard became a graveyard for links I didn’t actually want to read. Instead of a useful resource, it was a junk pile full of stale content.\n\n<h2>Digging out of a mess</h2>\n\nI took the following steps to return Pinboard to a useful utility for me:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>I deleted <em>everything</em> I had in Pinboard—over 3,000 bookmarks that were doing me no good. Most of these were articles I imported from my RSS reader (Reeder) or Twitter (via Tweetbot), read once, and then just left in Pinboard.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>I installed <a href=\"https://aki-null.net/shiori/\">Shiori</a> on my MacBook Pro. Shiori is a Pinboard bookmark launcher and editor. It's like <a href=\"https://qsapp.com\">QuickSilver</a> for Pinboard—hidden until you need it, only a keypress away, and accessible from anywhere. I set it up so that Control+Option+Command+P brings up the bookmark search window (from anywhere), and Control+Option+Command+B brings up the bookmark editor.</li>\n\t<li>I set up <a href=\"http://pinnerapp.net\">Pinner</a> on iOS. Pinner is a full-featured Pinboard client. It will open Pinboard bookmarks in Safari or within Pinner, via Safari View Controller. It has two app extensions for creating bookmarks. The first extension, “Quick Pin”, has no UI, and is for quickly adding bookmarks to read later. The second extension lets you edit, interactively, all the metadata associated with the bookmark prior to saving it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>My workflow</h2>\n\nI developed a new workflow to work with Pinboard, so I don’t end up with a mess of useless bookmarks again. Honestly, though, calling it a <em>workflow</em> is an exaggeration. I basically decided to manage Pinboard with a simple set of rules.\n\nI will continue to use Pinboard both for permanent bookmarks, which mostly involve specific technical documentation about Swift and iOS development, and for a read-it-later service, which are bookmarks I want to keep around temporarily, some of which I plan to keep long term.\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Bookmarks I would keep in Safari, for sites I would log into (banking websites, personal websites, blogs, GitHub, BitBucket, etc.), are stored as private bookmarks with tags. All of these bookmarks are also tagged “Safari” so I can pull them all, as a group, with a Pinboard search.</li>\n\t<li>Bookmarks for articles to read later, and everything else, are saved with the “read later” flag set to “true”, primarily by using Pinner’s “Quick Pin” extension or the “send to Pinboard” command within <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/ios/\">Reeder</a> (my RSS reader app of choice).</li>\n\t<li>I regularly use Pinner or Shiori to browse my “read later” list. Basically, I had to kick the Twitter habit.</li>\n\t<li>After I read articles marked “read later”, I delete the bookmark, or choose to save it. I am pretty ruthless about deleting bookmarks now, which is the opposite of how I used to be. If I don’t read something after a few days, I will just delete it.</li>\n\t<li>Rarely, I will choose to save the bookmark. If I do so, I edit the bookmark’s metadata to remove the “read later” flag and to add keywords and a description. I open copy the first paragraph of the article to the bookmark’s description field, so it’s clear to me later on why I saved it.</li>\n</ol>\n\nSo far this workflow has been working well for me. I collect “read later” bookmarks throughout the day, read through them in the evening, and delete almost all of them at the end of the day. My Pinboard bookmarks list is much smaller than before, but contains only good stuff that I want to act on, either now or later.\n",

				"content_text": "<a href=\"http://getdrafts.com\">Drafts 5</a> is a great app for capturing thoughts, drafting notes, and capturing tasks, and quickly sending them, via <em>Actions</em>, to other apps or services for further processing. The typical workflow is:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Launch Drafts</li>\n \t<li>Type a draft</li>\n \t<li>Launch an Action to process the draft</li>\n</ol>On iPhone, swiping left from anywhere to pick an Action is right at your fingertips, since you are typing on screen. On iPad, if you type with an external keyboard (which I highly recommend), launching an Action is a little more cumbersome. By default, you have to move your fingers off the keyboard and reach up to the screen to get to your Actions list. There is another way to launch Actions, however, that doesn't require you to move your fingers off the keyboard.\n<h2>Custom hardware keyboard shortcuts</h2>Drafts 5 lets you assign custom hardware keyboard shortcuts to any Action. This is an extremely rare, and extremely powerful, feature. You can configure hardware keyboard shortcuts for text formatting commands and to insert text snippets (such as today's date) into your draft. You can also define a set of hardware keyboard shortcuts to use to complete your drafts.\n\nI use Drafts 5 throughout the day to write microblog posts, notes, and tasks and send them to where they need to go: Dropbox, Ulysses, my to-do app <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com\">SwiftoDo</a>, and so on. For all my most-used Actions that process drafts, I use an easy-to-mash but hard to accidentally type accelerator, <code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>, plus one letter, when I complete my draft and want to send it on its way.\n\nI use the <code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code> accelerator <em>only</em> for Actions that complete drafts, so it's always clear to me when I type it that I am ending my draft and sending it somewhere else.\n\nHere is my list of hardware keyboard shortcuts, each of which I find incredibly useful:\n<ul>\n \t<li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>D</code>: save draft to a Dropbox folder</li>\n \t<li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>U</code>: save draft to a Ulysses Inbox folder</li>\n \t<li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>T</code>: send tasks in draft to my todo.txt file via SwiftoDo</li>\n \t<li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>M</code>: post draft directly to Micro.blog</li>\n \t<li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>G</code>: search for draft text in Google</li>\n \t<li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>A</code>: search for draft text in App Store</li>\n</ul>Each shortcut is easily mapped to its Action via the \"Edit Action\" dialog. (See the photo that accompanies this blog post.) If you forget what custom shortcuts you created, hold down <code>Command</code> while editing your draft, and all the custom shortcuts you defined will appear in the standard iOS hardware keyboard shortcut pop-up display.\n\nThese hardware keyboard shortcuts don't necessarily save me a <em>lot</em> of time and trouble, but they make my Drafts workflow on iOS feel fast and comfortable. I highly recommend setting some up for your own iPad Drafts workflow.\n",

I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->love<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this album. It helps that I was 15 when it came out, of course. But still, I think it is an emotionally rich artistic achievement.

Otherwise, it sounds the same as the CD version. You gain about 1-2% in fidelity at the price of lot of extra bits on the hard drive, and, perhaps, more dollars out of your wallet. This is true even though the 24-bit version was mastered to be a little quieter than the original CD and iTunes versions. You have to turn it up a notch to match the others' volume. Even with more amplification, the hi-res version&rsquo;s noise floor is incredibly low, and everything sounds fantastic.</p>\n<p>Overall, I would prefer to listen to all my music in lossless quality, in as high fidelity as possible. It can sound better than lossy rips, and, even if I can’t hear the difference on a particular track, why not listen to the best version available? That said, I subscribe to Apple Music, which serves AAC files, rather than Tidal, which has a lossless streaming plan, primarily for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->convenience<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Fortunately, for me, Apple’s 256kbps AAC files are completely adequate substitutes for lossless rips. I do think, though, that if Apple offered a lossless plan at a slight up-charge, I would subscribe to it.</p>\n",

We are <em>far</em> from the world of mushy, sizzly 128kbps MP3 files now. That said, the lossless versions <em>do</em> sound a tiny bit better. They reveal more detail than the lossy version, notably in the snap of the bass guitar and in the attack of the snare drum. The difference is slight: you have to listen very carefully to hear it, and you need equipment sensitive enough to reproduce the sounds accurately.\n\nThe main improvement the hi-res version brings over the CD-quality rip, to my ears, is a lower noise floor. Otherwise, it sounds the same as the CD version. You gain about 1-2% in fidelity at the price of lot of extra bits on the hard drive, and, perhaps, more dollars out of your wallet. This is true even though the 24-bit version was mastered to be a little quieter than the original CD and iTunes versions. You have to turn it up a notch to match the others' volume. Even with more amplification, the hi-res version's noise floor is incredibly low, and everything sounds fantastic.\n\nOverall, I would prefer to listen to all my music in lossless quality, in as high fidelity as possible. It can sound better than lossy rips, and, even if I can’t hear the difference on a particular track, why not listen to the best version available? That said, I subscribe to Apple Music, which serves AAC files, rather than Tidal, which has a lossless streaming plan, primarily for <em>convenience</em>. Fortunately, for me, Apple’s 256kbps AAC files are completely adequate substitutes for lossless rips. I do think, though, that if Apple offered a lossless plan at a slight up-charge, I would subscribe to it.\n",

This has happened multiple times to me over the past five years, which is a bummer <em>and</em> encouraged me to try to buy higher quality headphones each time. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>So what?</h2>\n\nI thought it would be fun to write about all my gear from one the years, from the first crappy boombox to the amazing headphones and DAV/amp combo I am rocking these days.

				"content_text": "<a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com\">SwiftoDo</a> is a passion project for me. I love working on it, but, due to work and family obligations, I have very little time to do so. Consequently, I am <em>way</em> behind schedule in adopting features introduced in iOS 11. I also learned, the hard way, that <em>lots</em> of minor UI-related bugs popped up when I changed the app’s target iOS framework from 9.0 to 11.0. I have been slowly discovering and cleaning up those bugs, and adding minor features here and there, for the past two and a half months.\n\n<h2>Release cadence</h2>\n\nI have decided to release working code as soon as possible, rather than trying to batch features and bug fixes into larger releases.

				"content_text": "I am still using the <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net\">Plaintext Productivity</a> system that I wrote about in 2013. It is a productivity system, based primarily on plaintext files, for Microsoft Windows users. Since I published a few people have asked me to write an update to <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net\">Plaintext Productivity</a>. The fact is, the system has held up so well for me that I really don’t have any updates to report.\n\nOne reason my system remains pretty much the same as it was in 2013 is that the operating system it is based on, <em><a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/index.html#why-is-windows-important-\">Windows</a></em>, despite some cosmetic changes, remains pretty much the same as it was in 2013. Sure, it got a better UI when Windows 10 supplanted Windows 7 and 8, but Windows still <em>works</em> just as well and just as poorly. Another pillar of the system, <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com\">Sublime Text</a>, also had a design change recently, to display more crisply on high-DPI screens, but it, too, works pretty much the same as it did in 2013.\n<h2>A little bit of history</h2>\nI developed my <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net\">Plaintext Productivity</a> system slowly over the years, as a result of the limitations I faced on my relatively locked down work computers, and my frustration with third party productivity apps going out of business and disappearing over the years. Gradually, I stripped down my productivity system to <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com\">a great text editor</a> and a <a href=\"https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt\">todo.txt-format</a> task list (with <a href=\"http://benrhughes.github.io/todotxt.net/\">a good client</a>), with some clever ideas about using a <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/2-09-work-journal.html\">journal</a> for planning, and for <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/3-00-files-introduction.html\">managing files</a>.\n\nBecause I was stuck on Windows, an operating system I did not particular like, I had to make do with built-in functionality, portable apps that I could sneak onto my system, and a universal file format: plaintext. Even this was challenging. Windows, for all it’s ubiquity, has a dearth of good <em>third party</em> (non-Microsoft) software for it. There is a lot of crapware in the Windows Store, several world class apps from Adobe that everyone knows about, and not that much in between. Macintosh, iOS, and to a far lesser extent, Android, have attracted the attention on small, boutique publishers and indie developers who have contributed great plaintext-based apps. <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com\">Like me</a>.\n<h2>Notes and drafts</h2>\nI still firmly believe in <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/2-00-notes-and-drafts-introduction.html\">writing lots of notes and drafts</a> to help document thoughts as well as meetings. I draft emails, write planning documents, write out procedures for work I have to repeat, and so on. I also keep a <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/2-09-work-journal.html\">work journal</a> every day (well, I’m not perfect about writing it <em>every</em> single day, but I try). At the start of each workday, I write a short journal post to plan my top activities for the day. At the end of each workday, I wrote an even shorter journal entry to help remind me where I left things, which sets me up for the next day. I set up calendar entries to remind me to do these journal entries. These activities help keep me, a person who works remotely and alone, organized, engaged with my work, and on task throughout the day.\n<h2>My text editor</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com\">Sublime Text</a> is still my favorite Windows text editor. It is even better than when I first bought it, over five years ago, and it was worth every penny. I love that it is lean, fast, flexible, and handles both my short notes and huge data files with aplomb. Its plugin system makes it a serviceable Markdown editor. I have syntax highlighting for Markdown, HTML, todo.txt, TaskPaper, and the various programming languages I use at work: ACL scripts (which I created myself), SQL, C#, VBScript, and Python (and there are far more available).\n\nBest of all, in my opinion, are its numerous, well-defined keyboard shortcuts for shifting lines around, selecting words, selecting whole lines, deleting whole lines, and so on. Its support for multiple text selection and multiple cursors makes certain quick edits, like making a bunch of lines a bullet list in Markdown, a snap; it’s actually kind of mind blowing when you get used to it. Lastly, I=its find and replace functionality is incredibly powerful as well, considering it supports regular expressions.\n\nI have found no compelling reason to switch it out for a newer, shiner app—which is the whole point of having a simple productivity system in the first place.\n\nI should say, though, that I do use Editorial or Ulysses on my iPad as a sidekick text editor quite frequently. I started to do so for a non-software related reason: my work machine’s mechanical keyboard is so loud that it bothers people on conference calls, while my iPad’s keyboard—the Apple Magic Keyboard—is so quiet that my phone does not pick it up. Those iOS apps are fantastic, but they are not vital to my Plaintext Productivity system.\n<h2>My task list</h2>\nI still <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/1-00-tasks-introduction.html\">use todo.txt for my work task list</a>. Since I wrote Plaintext Productivity, I contributed a ton of patches to my favorite Windows todo.txt app: todotxt.net. I contributed multiple task selection and editing, and a lot of other things. I went on to write Mac and iOS todo.txt apps, <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com/desktop\">SwiftoDo Desktop</a> and <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com\">SwiftoDo for iOS</a>. I tend to use SwiftoDo for iOS most of the time, and revert to todotxt.net only when I don’t want to context-switch away from my PC to my iPad or iPhone. My todo.txt file is synced via Dropbox between all these apps, so it doesn’t really matter which app I use at any given moment.\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt\">Todo.txt</a> is the best system for me because my work, and my GTD-inspired way of looking at my work, tends to present itself as a large number of tasks that get picked up, dropped, and re-prioritized frequently. I have started to dabble with <a href=\"https://www.taskpaper.com\">TaskPaper</a> for some of my planning needs, either in my daily work journaling, or when I have a self-directed project to plan, such as drafting a proposal or creating a software-based audit tool. TaskPaper is interesting, but I do too much sorting and filtering of tasks throughout the day for it to supplant todo.txt as my main task list system.\n\nI don’t keep track of every task in my life in todo.txt, however. I prefer to keep my personal tasks separate from my work ones, mainly because I find having them commingled with work tasks distracts me from my work. Therefore, I keep my personal tasks in <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205890\">Reminders</a>, which has had solid Siri support and cross-Apple-device syncing since 2011, and has only gotten better since then. I <em>have</em> changed a lot about how I managed non-work tasks since 2013, but those fall outside my Plaintext Productivity system.\n<h2>Filing and searching</h2>\nI still use the same <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/3-00-files-introduction.html\">filing system</a>, too, and have been consistently happy with it. While I believe that you should rely on search rather than elaborate folder structures for finding what you need to, Windows Search <em>still</em> is not great. Despite its weaknesses, and the frustrations those weaknesses sometimes cause, I still get by with it.\n<h2>Hardware and other things</h2>\nI also wrote about <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/4-05-hardware.html\">hardware</a> and <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/4-00-other-tips.html\">other things</a> in Plaintext Productivity. Since 2013, I have had the fortune to upgrade my keyboard to a 87-key mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Blue switches. I really like the clicky-clacky keyboard switches and the keyboard’s smaller size, which I credit with helping eliminate repetitive stress injuries in my wrists. I also made things easier on my eyes by upgrading my display from two 1080p monitors to one, much bigger, 4K display. Crisper text has reduced eyestrain and has made me much happier, though Windows has had, and <em>still has</em>, awful and inconsistent high-DPI support. I don’t miss having two screens at all, actually. I can tile two to four windows on screen, and use the virtual desktop feature that premiered in Windows 10, to get most of the benefits that multiple monitors afforded me in the past.\n<h2>The future of plaintext productivity</h2>\nI have never used the same productivity system for so long. It has been solid and reliable for me for years now, and required no real tweaks worth mentioning when upgrading from Windows XP to Windows 7 to Windows 10. I see no obvious need to replace or upgrade my system in the near future, either. Maybe someday, when everything is in virtual reality or something—but maybe not even then.\n\nIf you are interested in streamlining your Windows workflows, and discovering a productivity system that really lasts, I encourage you to check out my <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net\">Plaintext Productivity</a> guide.\n",

It isn't entirely original, but it is extremely <em>useful</em>, and produces a result that everyone in my family will eat, which is no small feat. \n\nI don't measure anything.  If I don't have salsa, I dump in tomato sauce or even just water; the result is more bland, but still edible, and it can be shredded and mixed with barbecue sauce if desired. I make this in the morning or at lunchtime and let it stay on Warm for hours and hours until dinnertime. I find the taste of chicken thighs improves after a couple hours on the Instant Pot's Warm setting. \n\n<h2>Ingredients</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>6 chicken thighs</li>\n\t<li>1 cup mild or medium salsa (eyeballed)</li>\n\t<li>1/4 cup water (eyeballed)</li>\n\t<li>2 large pinches kosher salt</li>\n\t<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Directions</h2>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Oil bottom of Instant Pot. </li>\n\t<li>Coat bottom of Instant Pot with 1 pinch of kosher salt.</li>\n\t<li>Add chicken thighs in one layer</li>\n\t<li>Season top of chicken thighs with 1 pinch of kosher salt.</li>\n\t<li>Cover with salsa. Add water if salsa is not very liquid. </li>\n\t<li>Lid the Instant Pot and cook under high pressure for 20 minutes.</li>\n\t<li>Allow pressure to release naturally. The Instant Pot will automatically switch to its Warm setting. Keep the chicken thighs on the Warm setting as long as you would like. The chicken tastes better after several hours on Warm.</li>\n</ol>\n",

I see tweets like this almost every day:\n<blockquote>Brad DeLong: “I wish there was a network like twitter, but not, you know, actually Twitter”</blockquote>\n&nbsp;\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">The folks at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@twitter</a> are spineless cowards.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">I wish there was a network like twitter, but not, you know, actually twitter\n\n— Dave DeLong (@davedelong) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davedelong/status/936365347615137793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 30, 2017</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>The thing is, practically since Twitter’s inception, alternatives <em>did</em> exist. I know. I used them: Identi.ca, StatusNet (the successor to Identi.ca), Pump.io (the successor to StatusNet), and App.net (a for-fee Twitter that got a lot of press but not so many users). And, I abandoned them and went back to Twitter, despite its flaws. So did everybody else.\n<h2>Why is Twitter so sticky, and nothing else is?</h2>\nWhat makes Twitter is valuable not what it does—microblogging is relatively easy to implement these days—but <em>who is on it</em>: Famous people! Intellectuals! Politicians! Journalists! These people and many more are not only publishing there, but reading there, too. Communication with, and between, influential people there can be two-way, and is usually in public, which is fascinating to read and unlike any other communications platform that had come before it. Twitter can amplify the voice of the non-famous and non-published people, too—the under-represented—which is often great.\n<h2>Why is Twitter described as a cesspool?</h2>\nSometimes, though, amplifying under-represented voices is <em>not</em> great. Some voices are under-represented because they are malicious: Racists! Nazis! Liars! Sexist doxxers! Spammers! Russian bots! Malicious people have unique incentives to exploit and abuse a communications platform like Twitter. First, simply <em>having</em> a medium and a platform to spread their message is unique to them, because these people have been barred or banned elsewhere from spreading their message. Second, access to this new platform may be fleeting, because they could be banned there, too, for the same reasons they have been banned elsewhere. Third, people who want to spread malice are not the type of people who are concerned with preserving the health of the platform’s community, or the platform’s reputation in the wider world. Therefore, they can destroy the platform in the process of spreading their message.\n<h2>Why can’t Twitter fix this?</h2>\nThe world is too complex to separate people, or Twitter users, into good and bad actors. What is unpopular or under-represented today may be celebrated tomorrow; it may be true and worth spreading today. Understandably, Twitter doesn’t want to choose who gets to speak on their platform. Therefore, they tolerate hate speech on their platform to a degree that makes some of their users angry. It puts the company in a difficult position when hate speech is broadcast (retweeted) by the President of the United States, as it was this week.\n\nI understand Twitter’s problems as a company. It needs eyeballs on it to sell ads. Controversy on the platform, and the sheer number of active users (whether they are real people or bots), lead to greater traffic, greater revenue, and greater return on investment for their investors—at least in the short run. In the long run, however, poisonous speech on the platform poisons the platform.\n<h2>What to do about it, as a Twitter user?</h2>\nBasically, it is hard to see how, as users, we can improve Twitter. Twitter, the company, owns the platform. Consequently, it has the sole power to fix its flaws. Improvements to blocking and reporting abuse that Twitter has implemented have not satisfied the users who need them the most.\n\nMoving away from Twitter entirely, onto another, similar platform, can work for small communities who primarily wish to communicate amongst themselves. It is unlikely, however, that a critical mass of influential users—the celebrities, journalists, etc., who make the platform valuable—will move to a different platform at this point. Without those users, another platform, however superior from a technical or community management standpoint, would not have as much value.\n\nAs a Twitter user, you really have two choices now: live with the abusive users, and report and block them as well as you can; or, if Twitter abuse is bothering you enough (or worse, threatening to your safety), stop using Twitter entirely. That is a sad conclusion to make, but I think it is realistic. Twitter’s ad-based model, need to generate both traffic and return on investment to satisfy its shareholders are, in the short run, at odds with its stated goal to improve safety, and therefore community, on its platform.\n\nFortunately, there are other ways to write content on the internet for free, such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.com\">WordPress</a>. The problem is, you may never achieve the same reach with these other platforms as you would with Twitter. That is why I am sticking with Twitter myself. From a moralistic point of view, I would love to ditch it for something else.

				"content_text": "At the end of last year, I quit using RSS. It was a big step for me. I had been using RSS practically since it first became available. My first <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">RSS</a> reader was the <a href=\"http://sagerss.com\">Sage</a> plugin for FireFox, which I started using in 2004. I subscribed to <a href=\"www.slate.com\">Slate</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com\">LifeHacker</a>, a couple other professional publications, and a fairly large number of personal blogs, covering topics ranging from technology, economics, and personal finance to cooking and television shows. I was obsessive about skimming my feed many times a day, reading every headline, and often every article, of Slate and my favorite blogs.\n\nI eventually dropped Sage for <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader\">Google Reader</a>, and used it, and later Feedly, as a back-end to whatever smartphone RSS reader I was using. For years I checked my feeds a dozen times a day, read a ton of articles (though not all of them, as I used to), and generally felt pretty happy with the experience.\n<h2>Why I quit using RSS</h2>I stuck with RSS <em>long</em> after I became a habitual Twitter user, long after I started to see articles linked to from Twitter before they hit my RSS reader, and long after most technology writers and podcasters started disparaging RSS as some antiquated technology that, like dial-up internet service, was hopelessly out of date.\n\nEventually, though, I quit using RSS—not because it was uncool, but because it was no longer making me happy. Like those writers and podcasters said, the basic need RSS fulfilled for me—keeping current, and entertained with fresh reading material—<em>was</em> being fulfilled by other services. Twitter did so more timely, and with more commentary from the writers. News aggregators, such as Apple News, did so with a slicker visual style. (I am emphatically <em>not</em> a regular Facebook user, so I miss out on whatever is going on there.)\n\nI thought these services were more hip, modern, and fun than RSS. Most importantly, I thought they were keeping me <em>more current</em>. After all, for a long time, my RSS reader (the wonderful <a href=\"#\">Reeder app for iOS</a>) fed me the same articles that I had already seen on Twitter. Worse, it fed me five or six different publications’ takes on the same subject every day, which was interesting a few days of the year (such as when reviews of new Apple devices hit the streets), but was otherwise completely redundant.\n<h2>What I missed without RSS</h2>After a year RSS-free, I started to think something was missing. I was literally missing articles that I would like to read, especially those from bloggers I liked, such as <a href=\"http://ericasadun.com\">Erica Sadun</a> and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net\">John Gruber</a>, because they would pass by in the timeline before I would see them. I was missing bloggers’ voices in general, because most of my Twitter list (like everybody’s, I’m sure) is heavily <em>news</em> related. I could keep up with what the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com\">New York Times</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com\">Washington Post</a> are publishing each day pretty well; but what about what <a href=\"http://www.manton.org\">Manton Reece</a> and <a href=\"http://marginalrevolution.com\">Tyler Cowlin</a> are publishing? Their voices were being buried in my Twitter feed by the daily (hourly?) news cycle.\n\nWithout RSS, I missed the spirit of the independent web: all those individuals and small publications who are sharing knowledge and expressing opinions that don’t fit into 140 characters, or even 280.\n<h2>Back to RSS (and Atom, and JSON Feed)</h2>After many months away from it, I realized that RSS wasn’t the problem—I was. I wasn’t using RSS in a way that made me happy. Worse, I supplanted it with Twitter, which both sucked up all my attention every day, and reduced my attention span for content to 140 characters (a length perfect for snipes and jabs and headlines, but insufficient for most cogent thoughts). Fortunately, RSS has not died since the rise of Twitter and Facebook. It has quietly remained a fundamental internet technology, undergirding nearly every online publishing platform. Many, many sites support it without advertising it the way they used to ten years ago. Luckily, any good client can find feeds using just the site URL.\n\nNot only RSS is still there: my longstanding RSS software is still there, too. Like in 2013, I am using <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/ios/\">Reeder</a> on iOS as a front end, and <a href=\"https://feedly.com/\">Feedly</a> as a back end. Reeder has been around almost as long as the App Store. It is rarely updated, but it just works. It’s simplicity, elegance, and stability make it one of the finest apps on the platform. Feedly, the back end service that actually checks my feeds, is a free service that I basically never look at. I don’t use their website. I don’t use their app. I don’t really know or care how they make money off of me. It, like Reeder, is solid, stable, and just works.\n<h2>Using RSS with a different perspective</h2>After returning to my RSS reader after such a long break, I had thousands of unread items and dozens of subscriptions. I decided to start over, so I unsubscribed to all my feeds, and started thinking about what I really wanted to get out of RSS, and, in general, out of the Internet.\n\nI decided to use RSS differently now. I no longer need it to drink the content firehose and keep current with the minute-by-minute news cycle; Twitter is available for that, for good or ill. Instead, RSS enables me to follow a few interesting voices on the Internet, read their actual, in-depth thoughts, and not miss anything they have to say.\n\nTo these ends, I no longer follow big media sites. Primarily, I follow blogs: <em>real</em> blogs, written by actual people, rather than published by massive organizations. I’m mostly following Apple-focused tech bloggers and Swift programmers, which reflects my favorite hobbies—but that’s just what I’m doing for now. Lastly, I’m not checking my RSS feeds a hundred times per day. I am checking only a one or two times per day, and often I don’t have any updates. Instead of adding more feeds, I just accept it now. Sometimes there’s nothing new to read, and that’s OK.\n\nI’m happy with RSS again. All it took was figuring out what I really needed to get out of it, and taking control of how I used it.

Third, it was ungainly: not only was it a large phone that strained my hand and my pockets, but its edges were smooth and slippery.

First, it looks great: the black finish is gorgeous and even blends seamlessly with Apple’s black leather case. Second, it feels great: I like the feel of the back much better, and the Apple leather case that came out with it has better quality leather, and clicky buttons on the sides. Its Taptic Engine, which provides force feedback for 3D Touch, the home button, and various user interface interactions, is absolutely amazing. It makes certain interactions, like scrolling picker views, 3D touching app icons, or pressing the home button, feel like you are interacting with actual, three-dimensional objects. It doesn’t vibrate as much as tap you with a reassuring, nearly soundless thud. The force feedback feels so good that it is almost addicting.

While those are the top Android phones in performance, hardware design, and features, I just don’t like them. It’s hard to put my finger on <em>exactly</em> why, but the materials and case design do not suit my tastes at all. They feel icky to me, in a way the Essential Phone never did.\n\n<h2>The emotional connection</h2>\n\nIt isn’t 100% rational what makes a piece of technology suit you. It’s <em>emotional</em>. And sometimes the most subtle things—such as the color and feel of the materials, or the quality of the haptic feedback—can make you love a phone, or hate it. \n\nGreat haptic feedback is a major contributor to why the iPhone 7 Plus is my favorite phone. It feels great, and it feels <em>alive</em> when I touch it. I didn’t expect that feature to even matter to me, let along <em>bind</em> me to that particular model of phone. But it did. I don’t think most handset manufactures get that. After all, <em>feeling</em> is not a checklist feature.\n\nI think Apple <em>does</em> get it, and little things like the Taptic Engine feeling so different than anything else are intentional parts of their industrial design and marketing strategies. Their industrial design and marketing teams have started (first, in my opinion, with the Apple Watch, and then with the iPhone 7), to really concentrate on what makes personal technology <em>personal</em>—that emotional connection you can have to your devices. And what they are doing is certainly working on me.\n",

Concatenation of the project and sub-project names is the best method for me.\n",

It is easy to forget about these costs when (1) the cost of the phone dwarfs them, and (2) the main cost of the phone is a relatively small monthly payment.</p>\n<p>This year, wiser about the switching costs, I am just not sure if it is worth it to go from the 7 to the 8 Plus or X.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Coming from the Plus, the iPhone X actually represents a step down in screen size (though it has a higher native resolution), lacks Touch ID, and has a smaller battery.

I don’t begrudge Apple for pricing the iPhone X so high, or other people for buying it without worrying about its cost. The high price is, however, a hint that the X may not be for me—at least not this year.\n\n<h2>Additional switching costs of an early upgrade</h2>\n\nWhile I love the idea of “renting” a smartphone with a fixed monthly cost (hardware as a service), it doesn’t really work that way.

				"content_text": "<p>I just spent $30 on an annual subscription to Ulysses, my favorite writing app (it is not <em>quite</em> a &quot;text editor&quot;) on macOS and iOS. It was a relatively expensive macOS and iOS app for years, and I thought of it as the best buy I ever made on the platform, because I always bought it on steep discount the day it was released, and upgrades have been free ever since. As much as I love it, I have never used it enough, mostly because I spend time programming rather than writing. That may change now, however, because I am paying now a lot more for the privilege to use it. Overall, I decided it is worth my money to continually support the software I love. That said, the much higher cost of Ulysses and other apps I rely on probably means I will be trying and buying far fewer alternatives. </p><p>There is a limit on how much I want to pay each year, total, for software. I am not sure what that limit is, however. It is over $100, I guess, based on my spending history. But it&apos;s not that much higher than that&#x2014;and I am a person who <em>loves</em> software. I will have to choose my apps with way more discipline and effort now that many will be an ongoing cost to me. I will be choosing just one text editor for $30 per year, rather than buying the top six of them for $5 apiece and maybe upgrading one or two of them to new versions, for another $5 apiece, after a couple of years.</p><p>I hope this arrangement will lead to better software, and more well-supported software, overall. It looks like it will have the side effect of reducing the number of apps on my home screen to an essential, more costly, more sophisticated few. That&apos;s not necessarily a bad thing. But it further raises the bar for new indie developers&#x2014;those without venture backing&#x2014;who are working on the next new thing.</p>\n",

The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Smart Keyboard<!-- raw HTML omitted --> just felt awkward to type on. It has very little tactile feedback, and almost no throw.

But, alas, it is not for me.</p>\n<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Logitech Create Backlit Keyboard<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, at first, appears to correct all of the Apple Smart Keyboard&rsquo;s shortcomings. It has real keys! It has decent key travel! It has a sturdy kickstand case instead of a floppy folding case! While it has real keys, and more features plus a lower price than the Apple Smart Keyboard, typing on one for a while felt awful to me. It started to feel mushy to me. It is also much heavier than the Smart Keyboard. I loved the kickstand, but I wanted something I could remove more easily, because the 12.9&quot; iPad Pro is heavy enough on its own when used handheld.</p>\n<p>So, after lots of time trying them out, both Smart Connector keyboards were out of the running for me.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>After trying out and being disappointed by the typing experience on the Apple and Logitech Smart Connector keyboards, I went back to my favorite keyboard of recent years, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Magic Keyboard<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s a full-size keyboard, which is comfortable to type on. It has a shallow keyfall distance, but it is not as shallow as the 12&quot; MacBook. Keypresses feel solid and clicky. The battery lasts for months. Build quality is top notch.</p>\n<p>I have not had any problems with dropped keystrokes when waking up the Magic Keyboard, but that is likely because my new iPad Pro itself goes to sleep, which is an option I had disabled on my old iPad. Whatever the reason, a single keypress wakes up the iPad Pro and I go on to typing without thinking about it. That&rsquo;s good enough for me.</p>\n<p>So, after an honest effort to upgrade to on of the Smart Connector keyboards, I passed on both of them, and settled for the Apple Magic Keyboard, because it offers the best typing experience for me. I am actually surprised about that, and a little disappointed that I did not like the other two options. Because I went with a detached keyboard, I had to consider different case and stand options, which I will go into in a later post.</p>\n",

The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0186RZAWQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0186RZAWQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;linkId=4c9ddcd7c23e99d9251ddb4e71643801\">Apple Smart Keyboard</a> just felt awkward to type on. It has very little tactile feedback, and almost no throw. It is floppy enough to be poorly suited for use on the lap (which, admittedly, would be rare). The case it comes attached to is slim, versatile, lightweight (for what it is, not overall), andstylish. But, alas, it is not for me.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KG0X7P8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B01KG0X7P8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;linkId=10161348aa4edd1d8e01e26ae9045672\">Logitech Create Backlit Keyboard</a>, at first, appears to correct all of the Apple Smart Keyboard's shortcomings. It has real keys! It has decent key travel! It has a sturdy kickstand case instead of a floppy folding case! While it has real keys, and more features plus a lower price than the Apple Smart Keyboard, typing on one for a while felt awful to me. It started to feel mushy to me. It is also much heavier than the Smart Keyboard. I loved the kickstand, but I wanted something I could remove more easily, because the 12.9\" iPad Pro is heavy enough on its own when used handheld.\n\nSo, after lots of time trying them out, both Smart Connector keyboards were out of the running for me.\n<h2>What about Bluetooth keyboards?</h2>\nWhile there are hundreds of Bluetooth keyboards you can pair with any iPad, they have a couple drawbacks. The main one for me is dropped keystrokes, due either to flaky Bluetooth connections, low quality components, or the keyboard requiring a keypress to wake from sleep. A secondary one is that they require batteries or recharging of their internal battery periodically, but that period is a few months long. Lastly, Bluetooth pairing can be tricky, especially if you try to use the same keyboard with multiple devices.\n\nAfter trying out and being disappointed by the typing experience on the Apple and Logitech Smart Connector keyboards, I went back to my favorite keyboard of recent years, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016QO64FI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B016QO64FI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;linkId=fe064dbc2ef2450d6b735c756c6c8912\">Apple Magic Keyboard</a>. It's a full-size keyboard, which is comfortable to type on. It has a shallow keyfall distance, but it is not as shallow as the 12\" MacBook. Keypresses feel solid and clicky. The battery lasts for months. Build quality is top notch.\n\nI have not had any problems with dropped keystrokes when waking up the Magic Keyboard, but that is likely because my new iPad Pro itself goes to sleep, which is an option I had disabled on my old iPad. Whatever the reason, a single keypress wakes up the iPad Pro and I go on to typing without thinking about it. That's good enough for me.\n\nSo, after an honest effort to upgrade to on of the Smart Connector keyboards, I passed on both of them, and settled for the Apple Magic Keyboard, because it offers the best typing experience for me. I am actually surprised about that, and a little disappointed that I did not like the other two options. Because I went with a detached keyboard, I had to consider different case and stand options, which I will go into in a later post.\n",
