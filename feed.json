				"content_html": "<p>I have a corner desk that is connected to a second, straight desk, which looks really cool, but is a pain (literally) to use. While it offers me enough space for two desktop computer setups: a necessarily sloppy-looking windows laptop-and-monitor setup for work, and a more streamlined Mac mini-and-monitor setup for home, it causes a lot of problems. The desktop is so high that it puts pressure on my forearms when I use the keyboard, which leads to wrist pain. The desktop on the Mac side is not level and there is no way to adjust it, so the monitor is always tilted slightly, which drives me crazy. The desk drawer and keyboard tray are too low and bang into the top of my legs. Lastly, the keyboard tray, when open, blocks the desk draw, which is super annoying.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a lot more to it than just the desk setup. There are low cabinets and high bookshelves stretching across two walls of my office, all connected into a big L. You can see that it is made up of many different components, but they are all stuck together with no space between the seams. For the past eleven years I thought it was glued together by the house’s prior owners, but my father-in-law pointed out to me tonight that I was mistaken. The furniture is screwed together; it was designed to attach. Therefore, it will be a straightforward (though physically demanding) process to separate it and get it out of my house. I could even keep the bookcases and low cabinets that aren’t bothering me especially, to make room for a new, completely separate desk.</p>\n\n<p>I am relieved to know that something can be done that falls short of hiring a demolition crew to break all this stuff apart and haul it away. I can get rid of the desk portions <em>only</em>, which I didn’t know was possible. That would leave me with 68 inches of space for a new desk. It will be more difficult to figure out how to accommodate both my Mac and PC setups, with all the USB peripherals and so on, but that is a problem that technology and money can probably solve.</p>\n",

As for the similarly “centrist” Kyrsten Sinema, she is at a whole other level of incomprehensibility, and could still be a spoiler to the Democrats even if Manchin eventually agrees to some bill. Neither one of them are fighting for anything of value for their constituents.

(It was discussed in my Shakespeare courses when it came to Bottom and Fallstaff, but that is about it.) Little did I know when I was a twenty-year-old college student that understanding and appreciating that I, too, would be capable or folly, succumb to folly, and see folly in others on a daily basis. Life experience, far more than schooling, has taught me that folly is inevitable and inescapable in life, for both good and for ill. As Erasmus’s essay cheekily suggests, if folly is inevitable, you might as well find something to enjoy in it.\n\nMy folly, as a very young adult reading Erasmus for the first time, was thinking that adult life, which I was heading into apace, was going to make sense once I got there.\n\n",

The World</em></a> for the Nintendo Switch. It was an impulse purchase of a game I had not heard of and didn’t know was any good. I have been wanting to play a brawler for a while, but it is a genre I have not played since I was a kid, so I was not sure I would still enjoy it. I have been eyeing, but have been reluctant to spend $30 of $25 on, <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/river-city-girls-switch/\"><em>River City Girls</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/streets-of-rage-4-switch/\"><em>Streets of Rage 4</em></a> for weeks now. I haven’t played a game in that genre since I was a kid, and as an adult I am terrible at a lot of the games I used to excel at (I’m looking at you, Mario!) so I was not sure if I could button-mash fast enough to play such games. $25 or more is too much to spend on a game that is too hard for me to play. While I dithered about a purchase, I spent some time playing NES versions of the <em>Double Dragon</em> games and <em>River City Ransom</em>, but found those games are too primitive to be much fun for me anymore.</p>\n\n<p>The Scott Pilgrim game was on sale for a stupidly low price ($7.49 or something), so I picked it up. To my surprise and delight, it is awesome. It has a colorful pixel art style that mimics the Scott Pilgrim comics. Its level design, character design, and animations show a lot of humor and attention to the source material. The chiptune soundtrack is really catchy. Play controls are easy to pick up. It starts out really hard, but you can replay levels to level up your character (i.e., lean new moves), and earn money to upgrade your character’s stats (strength, defense, etc.), which makes the game easier. It is kind of grind-y, at least for a conservative, low-skilled player like me, but the grind is fun.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, everything about the video game does justice to the source material. Playing it caused me to want to reread the graphic novels, which I started to do yesterday. <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>, in comics form, is weird, surreal, and a real mess—you know, a perfect reflection of the early twenties and late teens lives of its characters. The characters, plot, and themes of the book, are complex, messy, flawed, and not fully formed. Nobody is a role model. Nobody is mature. Reality itself is warped for them. It makes no sense that Scott goes into video game mode and <em>kills</em> his girlfriend’s exes. Is that a metaphor? Only kind of. You’re just not expected to take it seriously. It’s <em>all</em> problematic—like life, I guess. I don’t really think it is deep (maybe you would if you were much younger than me), but it is really good at stirring up complicated thoughts and emotions in me about how messy life is. During this re-read, I have thought about how I might judge people who haven’t figured their lives out yet, or overlook the good qualities in someone like that.

I didn’t see how women were treated at other workplaces.</p>\n\n<p>To prepare for our project, which was a group presentation, I did a lot of reading on the wage gap issue. It didn’t make sense to me that it could exist. I could understand if compensation amounts averaged out with a gap between male and female average wages, but I thought there had to be a sensible reason for that. It must come down to things like the type of job taken, the number of hours worked per week, the number of overtime hours worked, employee performance, and on asking for a higher salary when applying for a job.

That isn’t happening; therefore, the gender pay gap did not really exist. My project team was mostly young corporate women. They agreed with me. We didn’t even really argue about it, though I remember acting a little embarrassed about the conclusion I had come to when I presented it to them. We presented on the topic based on my conclusion, and otherwise had a successful, if uneventful, presentation to our class.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is, my idea of rational hiring decisions does not reflect how the world works. People make hiring decisions—and all kinds of other decisions—for reasons that don’t make rational sense at all. At the heart of these decisions are preferences, and preferences are largely affected by bias. Bias is, essentially, a preference that can’t be adequately explained. Put another way, bias just doesn’t make sense. No sense can be made from it because it doesn’t depend on sense.</p>\n\n<p>I came to this conclusion shortly after my team completed that project. I have thought a lot about it since. The thought of it pops into my head unexpectedly sometimes, like the memory of a time I sang the wrong line of a song in the high school musical, in front of everybody on closing night, and it crowds out memory of the rest of my performance, across all the performances, where I made no mistakes. It’s easy to dwell on the times you get things wrong, I suppose. At least in this case I learned something.</p>\n\n<p>Now that I am older and have more experience with and exposure to the world, I notice that bias is everywhere. Bias is the sort of thought virus that nibbles away at logic and replaces it with something that feels more right or more comfortable to the thinker or decider. You do not choose to be biased; if anything, bias, soaked up from the society around them, chooses you.</p>\n\n<p>Since I made that business school presentation years ago, my conclusion on the topic has completely reversed. Bias must affect hiring decisions and wages to the detriment of traditionally underserved or discriminated against groups of people, including women, <em>because it affects everything else</em>. Moreover, you can’t go looking for it with logic, because bias is inherently illogical.</p>\n",

The thought of it pops into my head unexpectedly sometimes, like the memory of a time I sang the wrong line of a song in the high school musical, in front of everybody on closing night, and it crowds out memory of the rest of my performance, across all the performances, where I made no mistakes. It’s easy to dwell on the times you get things wrong, I suppose. At least in this case I learned something.\n\nNow that I am older and have more experience with and exposure to the world, I notice that bias is everywhere. Bias is the sort of thought virus that nibbles away at logic and replaces it with something that feels more right or more comfortable to the thinker or decider. You do not choose to be biased; if anything, bias, soaked up from the society around them, chooses you. \n\nSince I made that business school presentation years ago, my conclusion on the topic has completely reversed. Bias must affect hiring decisions and wages to the detriment of traditionally underserved or discriminated against groups of people, including women, *because it affects everything else*. Moreover, you can’t go looking for it with logic, because bias is inherently illogical. \n\n",

Over the past week, I gave <a href=\"https://endel.io\">Endel</a> an honest try, too.</p>\n\n<p>While I enjoy classical music in a live setting, I don’t like listening to it in my headphones.

It got me through reading and writing hundreds and hundreds of pages of text. However, I find my engagement with jazz to be all over the map. I love some of it and I hate some of it, and the kind of jazz you can just have on, not listening to—smooth jazz, I suppose—is just bad. All in all, I find jazz too distracting to listen to while I work, unless I listen to a single album that I already know and love.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music#2000s%E2%80%93present:_Hypnagogic_pop_and_chillwave\">Lo-fi hip hop</a> is my favorite background music at this point. I appreciate its nearly constant beat, somewhat consistent tempos, and there appears to be a never-ending supply of it.

I like the idea a lot more than the reality of it, though I think it has a lot to do with my tinnitus. Endel is extremely treble-heavy and bass-light (really, there is no bass at all), and only one of its scenarios, Focus, has a beat. I would not describe the sounds as shrill, but they aggravate my tinnitus instead of helping me ignore it. Last week, I listened to Endel exclusively through headphones (my B&amp;O H9s and my AirPods) while I did chores like the dishes and laundry. This morning, now that I am back at work, I tried listening to the Focus soundscape for a few hours through my loudspeakers. It drove my wife and both my kids absolutely bananas. Each of them yelled at me to stop playing it, even though it was not playing loudly, and they were on a different level of the house.

Although not as mature as the package manager I am most familiar with, [APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)), Winget *is* pretty awesome. I was able to use it from the Windows CMD shell (because Windows Terminal does not come pre-installed) to install everything I needed, from Visual Studio Code to Vim to NextDNS. It saved me a ton of time. If I set up new Windows machines frequently, I could write a script to automate all of it.\n\nIt is interesting to see all the developer- and administrator-friendly enhancements Microsoft has made to Windows over the past few years. Windows Terminal, Winget, and Visual Studio Code are miles ahead of what Microsoft offered just a few years ago.\n\n",

Heck, <a href=\"https://github.com/microdotblog/microblog-ios/blob/master/README.md\">it doesn’t even look likely that Micro.blog will accept pull requests</a>, so it is unclear whether open-sourcing it will change its development direction or iteration time at all. I’m not complaining about that, though. Maintaining an open source project/community and running a successful blog hosting business are almost entirely orthogonal to each other. Open source doesn’t really give me added comfort that an app I love or depend on will be there for me forever, because nothing is forever, even open-source software projects.</p>\n\n<p>As a computer user and enthusiast, I used to care a lot more that I do now about free, libre, and open-source software. My primary reason was that I thought I could trust it more than closed source software. It is harder to hide malware, tracking, and obvious security flaws when the code is publicly viewable. History has shown that not to be entirely true. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed\">Remember Heartbleed</a>?

That’s because one of the great, unfulfilled promises of computer science is the ability to solve a certain problem once and for all, for everybody. Open source utilities, like the Unix command line tools, and open-source libraries, like OpenSSL, theoretically could make this happen. But it didn’t happen, at least not fully. We spend a lot of time, collectively, solving the same software problems over and over again. We may approach these problems in new ways, with new languages, and on new platforms.

Imagine where we could be if we didn’t keep repeat ourselves!</p>\n\n<p>I actually think that most of the repetition is the inevitable result of human nature. Humans are curious; we want to know how something works, and how to do it ourselves.

That could be very helpful. Long ago, I was interested in creating a dead-simple iOS app (extension, widget, whatever) for Micropub posting. Eventually, well before this week, Micro.blog open-sourced its <a href=\"https://github.com/microdotblog/snippets\">Snippets</a> library, which would have made writing such an app much easier.

In the same vein, maybe someone else could use much more of that source code and build a better, more feature-rich client app based on it. Maybe the Micro.blog app is a solved problem, and no one has to solve it again (at least until Apple stops supporting the frameworks it is based on), and a hundred other Micropub-blogging-based small businesses could spring up, all using a common client app. Who knows?

I spent hundreds of hours this year watching talks on YouTube (both good and bad ones), watching instructional videos on speaking and on creating effective visual presentations, and trying new slide design techniques (and throwing out all the things I tried that didn’t work). I tried really hard to push myself out of my PowerPoint design rut. I thought I was good at presenting <em>before</em>, but now I think I have really leveled up. I have internalized a lot of the lessons I learned this year.</p>\n\n<p>The most visually impressive, most engaging, most well written talk that I have ever created is due to my bosses tomorrow. It is complete. It would make for a great 80 minute talk. But it has to be cut, and maybe cut down by half.

				"content_text": "I have recently finished crafting a slideshow, and writing a talk to go with it, that is the best one I have ever done, probably by a mile. I spent hundreds of hours this year watching talks on YouTube (both good and bad ones), watching instructional videos on speaking and on creating effective visual presentations, and trying new slide design techniques (and throwing out all the things I tried that didn’t work). I tried really hard to push myself out of my PowerPoint design rut. I thought I was good at presenting _before_, but now I think I have really leveled up. I have internalized a lot of the lessons I learned this year.\n\nThe most visually impressive, most engaging, most well written talk that I have ever created is due to my bosses tomorrow. It is complete. It would make for a great 80 minute talk. But it has to be cut, and maybe cut down by half.

I don’t think I _saw_ them in my mind’s eye, though. Not really. It was long ago, so I can’t remember reliably, but I probably figured out a different way to do it.\n\nTo me, it is interesting to learn that some people “see” mental images easily and think in an incredibly visual manner, because that is not the way I experience anything.\n\n",

				"title": "Lossless Music Discussion on ATP Podcast",
				"content_html": "\n\n<p>The latest episode of <a href=\"https://atp.fm\">Accidental Tech Podcast</a> has <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+R7DXCWO3Y/26:33\">a great discussion about lossless music</a>, which is coming to Apple Music next month.</p>\n\n<p>I am 1000% the target audience for lossless and hi-res audio, and very excited for <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/\">Apple Music</a> to stream CD quality audio (and sometimes 24bit/96KHz). Even I readily admit I can’t hear the difference most of the time; but sometimes I can, especially on my best equipment. Moreover, I like the idea of getting the best possible quality up to my capacity to hear it (meaning “CD quality” not “hi-res”).</p>\n\n<p>I look forward to reading the 2021 M1 iMac reviews later, even though I will likely never buy that computer. It’s the sort of thing I <em>would</em> want if my family were structured more around, say, a central computing location in the family room or something. We all have iPads instead.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"webex-has-virtual-backgrounds\">WebEx has virtual backgrounds?!</h1>\n\n<p>A software update at work pushed out the virtual backgrounds feature for WebEx. Since my home office—at least the part of it that is <em>behind</em> me and not under my control— is a mess, I enabled it.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, it looks pretty awful. The background mostly leaves a halo around me un-obscured; sometimes it clips portions of my face or shoulder off. I have a very high-end laptop and a “very good” Logitech webcam (all webcams are terrible, I think), so I have concluded that WebEx’s technology is way behind Zoom’s, which does the virtual backgrounds flawlessly. I think I will leave virtual backgrounds on, for privacy reasons, and hope no one minds the weird visual side effects.</p>\n\n<p>I did not have to wait long for the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/\">Apple Music announcement</a> to drop.</p>\n\n<p>Apple Music can release its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439885/apple-music-tease-hi-fi-lossless-music-streaming\">rumored lossless tier</a> any minute now. I’m waiting with my best headphones. I don’t care at all about spatial audio or Dolby Atmos, though, so I hope that isn’t the only kind of thing coming.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"apple-is-poised-to-lose-its-antitrust-battle\">Apple is Poised to Lose its Antitrust Battle</h1>\n\n<p>I think that Apple is going to lose whatever antitrust cases are eventually brought against it in the EU and in the US. I don’t actually think Apple <em>should</em> lose, because I don’t think it is correct to call Apple a monopoly.</p>\n\n<p>The general antitrust argument against Apple is that its App Store platform is too locked down, and that is unfair because Apple is a monopoly (insert eye roll here) of its own platform. App is a platform owner. Of course it has a “monopoly” over the platform it owns. That doesn’t make it a monopoly in the overall marketplace. Moreover, while iOS is undoubtedly popular, it is a <em>minority</em> smartphone platform, which in the broadest legal terms that I understand, makes monopoly-related antitrust law not apply to them.</p>\n\n<p>App developers have to accept Apple’s terms, and pay a pretty large commission to Apple, to distribute apps in the store or to take in-app purchases. That may not feel fair to developers, but I can’t take seriously the arguments that it is illegal. It is the same way that game consoles work. Will we go after Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft next? Shouldn’t they open up their game consoles to alternative payment systems and alternate app stores, too? I have heard of no one seriously arguing this.</p>\n\n<p>The most compelling argument against Apple’s App Store requirements is that Apple demands too much money from developers for distribution and payment solutions that other companies now offer at lower prices. I am sympathetic to this argument because I too think Apple should have lowered its commission over the years, as marginal costs for these technologies and services have declined. However, the size of Apple’s cut is not really at issue here. Apple, rather clumsily, lowered its commission for a majority of its developers to 15%, starting in January 2021, but the antitrust talk just keeps rolling on.</p>\n\n<p>The second most compelling argument against Apple is that it uses its platform-owner advantage to position its own software and services over third-party competitors. Again, I sympathize. Apple Sherlocks developers sometimes, and can position its own software and services over anyone else’s. So does Microsoft (ever use Windows?). Amazon exercises a tremendous advantage over third party sellers in its online marketplace.</p>\n\n<p>I could argue that even Linux vendors, such as Ubuntu, position their own, preferred software over that of third-party developers. Software platform owners always have advantages over third parties that operate on their platform. Extracting as much value from that as is possible is the entire point of creating and owning a platform. I think it only becomes an antitrust problem when a company has majority market share, which Apple does not have.</p>\n\n<p>If developers can’t accept Apple’s terms, then they shouldn’t. They should develop for Android instead, which has the majority market share anyway, or create progressive web apps. (Remember, the web is an app platform, too, not just a way to collect credit card payments for software.) If developers “need” to develop for iOS because iOS users, on average, spend way more money on apps than Android users, then that just shows the value Apple’s marketplace has, and <em>is</em> worth paying for.</p>\n\n<p>Despite my views, I still think Apple is poised to lose any legal actions about them regarding monopoly. It won’t lose based on the merits of whatever case is brought against it; it will lose because enough political sentiment is against Apple, at least in this area, and that is all that matters. Perhaps all the tech giants will fall under this scrutiny, and all will be forced to open up their platforms more widely, and will be forced to renounce their first-party advantage when distributing applications and features. I just don’t see that actually happening, and if it does happen, I don’t think it will benefit anybody in the way government regulators would expect. It could even stifle the development of the next generation of technology platforms.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"is-a-higher-quality-apple-music-tier-on-the-way\">Is a higher-quality Apple Music tier on the way?</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2021/05/is-a-higher-quality-apple-music-tier-on-the-way/\">I hope so.</a> I am a sucker for lossless codecs, even though I probably can’t hear the difference between them and AAC-256.</p>\n\n<p>I have been using SQL for 25 years and I just learned today that <code>SELECT [...] FROM Table1, Table2</code> is called a “<a href=\"https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-basics/sql-server-cross-join/\">cross join</a>” an can also be expressed as <code>SELECT [...] FROM Table1 CROSS JOIN Table2</code>. 🤦 In my defense, I must say that I have only had to use a cross join a few times in my entire career.</p>\n\n<p>I unblocked Reddit.com earlier this week because the domain keeps coming up in tech question-related search results. After only a few days, I’m back looking at mechanical keyboards and expensive headphones on Reddit like an addict. I just blocked the domain again.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"durgod-zeus-engine-upgrade\">⌨️ Durgod Zeus Engine Upgrade</h1>\n\n<p>To my complete surprise, I discovered today that Durgod released an update to their keyboard configuration: Durgod Zeus Engine. The interface looks a lot better, and it is a little easier to use. They didn’t change the keyboard hardware driver to support function layers, which is unfortunately. I really want that. (Honestly, what I want is the ObinsKit software that powers the Anne Pro 2 to apply work on it.)</p>\n\n<p>I set up a new RGB color scheme and remapped my CapsLock to Control, saved them to the keyboard’s local profile, and (out of habit) configured the Zeus Engine to <em>not</em> start every time I log on. I plugged my keyboard into my USB hub and will keep my fingers crossed that it will work reliably now.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"report-apple-s-m2-chips-may-launch-as-soon-as-july-2021\">Report: Apple’s M2 chips may launch as soon as July 2021</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/report-apples-m2-chips-may-launch-as-soon-as-july-2021\">Napier Lopez reports in <em>The Next Web</em></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apple only just released its new iMacs featuring the acclaimed M1 ARM-based processor, but according to a report from Nikkei, the company plans to launch M2 as soon as July.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t know anything in particular about Apple’s plans, but it seems crazy to me to expect a faster chip at this time. What I would expect is more I/O, driven by more cores and supported by more RAM. Of course, I could be wrong. Maybe Apple can overvolt the M1 to get more speed out of it, and will call it by another name.</p>\n\n<p>I am very conservative about cities re-opening too soon, considering the pandemic has not ended. But <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/29/new-york-city-mayor-bill-de-blasio-says-the-city-will-re-open-100percent-on-july-1.html\">NYC reopening on July 1</a> almost seems reasonable to me. Time will tell.</p>\n\n<p>🎵 I’m going to lean into my New Jersey-ness today and listen to a ton of Bruce Springsteen. First album up: <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-wild-the-innocent-the-e-street-shuffle/186149850\"><em>The Wild, The Innocent, &amp; the E Street Shuffle</em></a>. This is one of Springsteen’s records that I never think to listen to, but, of course, it’s great. It was made back when Springsteen still wrote songs with a torrent of stream-of-consciousness-style lyrics like a verbose street poet.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"microsoft-is-changing-the-default-office-font-and-wants-your-help-to-pick-a-new-one\">Microsoft is changing the default Office font and wants your help to pick a new one</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407297/microsoft-office-new-default-font-2022\">Per Tom Warren In <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Microsoft is changing its default Office font next year and wants everyone to help pick the new default. While there are more than 700 font options in Word, Microsoft has commissioned five new custom fonts for Office, in a move away from the Calibri font that has been the default in Microsoft Office for nearly 15 years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am unusually attached to Calibri so I am not looking forward to this change. Then again, at work I often have to publish using Arial Narrow, which I think is objectively awful in terms of aesthetics and legibility, so it probably won’t affect me too much.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"amazon-vine-review-pomelohome-bread-knife-8-serrated-stainless-steel-bread-knife-german-high-carbon-steel-serrated-knife\">Amazon Vine Review: PomeloHome Bread Knife | 8&rdquo; Serrated Stainless Steel Bread Knife | German High Carbon Steel Serrated Knife</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"4-stars\">4 Stars</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"looks-great-but-i-don-t-love-the-shape-of-the-handle\">Looks great, but I don’t love the shape of the handle</h3>\n\n<p>Overall, this bread knife is pretty good, but its straight shape provides poor knuckle clearance, which makes cutting loaves with hard bottom crusts more difficult than it should be. A curved or tapered blade is a better design.</p>\n\n<p>The coolest thing about this knife is that it is one piece of metal from tip to handle. That is appealing to me in terms of durability, especially because I am in the middle of getting rid of a set of knives from another brand because their handles are falling apart.</p>\n\n<p>I could not tell it from the product photos, but the shape of the handle is roughly triangular: it is slimmer at the bottom than at the top. It looks cool in photos, but it isn’t the best ergonomically for me because there is a less surface area than I am used to to grip on the bottom of the knife.</p>\n\n<p>The blade is made of high-carbon steel, which is exactly what you want in a kitchen knife because it promises to retain sharpness for a long time.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-sequence\">The Sequence 🎮</h1>\n\n<p>Yesterday I decided to re-play a game I loved a few years ago called <em><a href=\"http://ombgames.com/?p=121\">[The Sequence]</a></em>. It is a puzzle game where you, essentially, build a machine with various component parts to move a ball (well, the game calls it a “binary cell”) from one part of the screen to another. It sounds simple, and it starts out fairly simple, but it becomes very challenging as you progress. It’s the sort of game a programmer, or anyone who enjoyed <em><a href=\"https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine\">Human Resource Machine</a></em> would enjoy.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"fez\">Fez 🎮</h1>\n\n<p>I am delighted that I discovered a video game that is <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/fez-switch/\">new to the Nintendo Switch</a>, but not at all new to the world, called <a href=\"http://www.fezgame.com\">Fez</a>. This is the game’s official blurb:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gomez is a 2D creature living in a 2D world. Or is he? When the existence of a mysterious 3rd dimension is revealed to him, Gomez is sent out on a journey that will take him to the very end of time and space. Use your ability to navigate 3D structures from 4 distinct classic 2D perspectives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is a 2D puzzle platformer where your character can rotate the environment left or right 90 degrees at a time, but you always interact with the environment in two dimensions. Some of the puzzles are quite challenging, but I think that the most hidden secrets that you can get from solving the hardest puzzles are all optional to completing the game. It’s a charming game, and easily my favorite Switch game of this year so far.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-shooting-likely-lasted-one-or-two-minutes\">The shooting likely lasted one or two minutes.</h1>\n\n<p>I am unsettled today by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/16/us/indianapolis-fedex-shooting#the-attack-is-the-latest-in-a-recent-series-of-mass-shootings-in-the-us\">yet another mass shooting</a> in my country. It seems like not a day goes by without a <em>New York Times</em> news alert about it. (I plan to turn those alerts off after I finish writing this.) This time, a gunman killed seven people, then himself. This detail about the story jumped out at me: “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/16/us/indianapolis-fedex-shooting#shooting-at-a-fedex-warehouse-in-indianapolis-leaves-8-dead\">The shooting likely lasted one or two minutes</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>I think the news media covers mass shootings like they are exciting, like some kind of action movie where bad outcomes only happen to the extras, and the rest of us get to watch. But “one or two minutes” isn’t an action movie. It isn’t something exciting. It’s actually, really, really stupid. That such a thing is even possible, outside a war, is embarrassing and shameful to all of us. I wish it were more widely considered to be.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"iphone-13-mini-could-be-the-last-mini-iphone-says-kuo\">iPhone 13 mini could be the last &lsquo;mini&rsquo; iPhone, says Kuo</h1>\n\n<p>Stephen Warwick reports in <em>iMore</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kuo says that next year Apple will drop the 5.4-inch model and run with two 6.1-inch models instead, one Pro, one regular.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This rumor is a prime reason I upgraded to the iPhone 12 mini early this year. I absolutely love the size and weight of it. It fits better in my hands and in my pockets than my iPhone 7 Plus ever did. However, the 12 mini’s small screen size makes it less compelling to read on, edit photos on, or watch videos on. These are all things I do pretty much every day without complaint, but if it were going to be my only portable device I would have bought one with a bigger screen.</p>\n\n<p>I have no desire to go back to a larger phone, because the phone, for me, is one tool among many, rather than the center of my computing universe. It doesn’t have to be compelling, just useful. It doesn’t have to be used constantly, just when it makes the most sense to.</p>\n\n<p>Some time from now, I think the smartphone, as a thing I carry around all the time, and as the default “Internet communication device,” is going to disappear and be replaced by something else: smart glasses maybe, or some kind of earpiece (when I am really old and need hearing aides).</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"my-first-nuget-package\">My First NuGet Package</h1>\n\n<p>Last night, I published my first <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/what-is-nuget\">NuGet</a> package: <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/TodoTxt.Library/1.0.0\">TodoTxt.Library</a>. It is a code library meant to help develop <a href=\"http://todotxt.org\">todo.txt</a> applications in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework\">.NET</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote the code back in 2015, <a href=\"https://github.com/mjdescy/TodoTxt.Library\">open-sourced it on GitHub</a>, but otherwise left it alone because I had moved on to more macOS and iOS development by that time. This week, I upgraded the code base work on .NET 5, so that it is cross platform (rather than Windows-only, as was my original version), and figured out how to package it and upload it to NuGet, where it may have a shot at actually being used.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"microsoft-announces-surface-laptop-4-with-choice-of-intel-or-amd-processors\">Microsoft announces Surface Laptop 4 with choice of Intel or AMD processors</h1>\n\n<p>Tom Warren’s article on <em>The Verge</em> caught my eye:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Microsoft is refreshing its Surface lineup with the Surface Laptop 4 today, which now offers the choice between AMD or Intel processors across both the 13.5- and 15-inch models. Both sizes will ship with Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors or AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series processors. Microsoft is shipping its Surface Laptop 4 on April 15th in the US, Canada, and Japan, starting at $999 for the AMD model and $1,299 for the Intel version — a $300 price gap between the pair.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If I was more of a Windows guy I would probably buy only Microsoft-brand laptops at this point. They don’t always have the best specs, but I like their designs a lot.</p>\n\n<p>I spend most of my computing time using Windows for work. I try to forget that I have a Lenovo laptop by putting it behind a giant monitor and using an external keyboard and trackball to operate it. Lenovo laptops are good, I guess, as long as I don’t have to touch them. I don’t like their keyboards (both in terms of layout and feel) or the pointing devices (the trackpad is too small, and I’m done with using the trackpoint/eraserhead thing). The Surface Laptops keyboards and trackpads have always seemed a lot more sensible to me in how they are designed.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"siri-reveals-apple-event-planned-for-tuesday-april-20\">Siri Reveals Apple Event Planned for Tuesday, April 20</h1>\n\n<p>I’m assuming that somebody’s job, every day, is to wake up in the morning and ask Siri “<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/13/siri-apple-event-tuesday-april-20/\">When is the next Apple Event</a>?” I’m glad I didn’t try to change careers back in 2009 or 2011 (when I thought of it) and get into tech journalism.</p>\n\n<p>I never would have predicted that in 2021 I would be using <a href=\"https://farmanager.com\">a text-mode file manager from the 1990s</a>, a <a href=\"https://github.com/VladimirMarkelov/ttdl\">command-line based to-do list program</a>, and, at least sometimes (by choice!), the <a href=\"https://www.vim.org\">Vim</a> text editor.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight I published a huge update to the website for my first iOS app: <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com\">SwiftoDo</a>. What was once a one page site with a very outdated template is now a Hugo-based site full of information. There is a lot more that I could add, it is now so much better than my old site I had to publish it.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"james-hoffman-s-aeropress-video\">James Hoffman’s AeroPress video</h1>\n\n<p>Last year when I was looking for something soothing to watch on YouTube, I came across James Hoffmann’s many videos about coffee, coffee machines, coffee products, and so on. I have watched a ton of them, mostly because I like his voice and demeanor. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/aidvrssMSGo\">His latest video</a> is about the <a href=\"https://aeropress.com\">AeroPress</a>, which I have used for many, many years. I actually learned something new from it: People use the funnel, which is meant to help put your coffee grounds into the press without making a mess, to brew coffee into cups with mouths too small for the bottom of the AeroPress. I have to try that! He also states in the video that the AeroPress is easy to make good coffee from, but is difficult to master. I actually put very little effort into my AeroPress use—far less than I used to when I first starting using it. I have found that my AeroPress brewing technique, no matter how sloppy or lazy, doesn’t seem to affect my coffee all that much. It prefer not stressing about it anymore.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"linux-on-the-m1-mac-mini\">Linux on the M1 Mac Mini</h1>\n\n<p>The Linux kernel is <a href=\"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/soc/soc.git/commit/?h=for-next&amp;id=0d5fe4b31785b732b71e764b55cda5c8d6e3bbbf\">gaining Apple M1 support</a>. I have been wondering if, years from now, I can move my M1 Mac Mini to a home app-server role, running Linux, when it gets too old for Xcode and stops getting macOS updates. I have a Celeron based PC doing that for me now, but it runs hot and can be noisy, too. If a machine can run Linux, it extends its lifespan considerably for me.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"my-first-failed-attempt-to-flash-qmk-on-my-mechanical-keyboard\">My (first) failed attempt to flash QMK on my mechanical keyboard</h1>\n\n<p>I wasted an hour last night trying to install <a href=\"https://qmk.fm\">QMK firmware</a> on my work computer’s mechanical keyboard, a <a href=\"https://www.durgod.com/page9?product_id=47&amp;_l=en\">Durgod Taurus K320</a>. I have a love/hate relationship with it. I love that it has the best build quality, rigidity, stabilization, keycaps, and typing feel and sound of any of the many (many!) keyboards I have owned over the years. I hate that its software is buggy: so buggy that sometimes the keyboard hangs and I have to unplug it to fix it; so buggy that I have to plug it in directly to my laptop rather than through a USB hub; so buggy that that I cannot program its layers the way I want to.</p>\n\n<p>Very recently, someone figured out how to run QMK firmware on it, which could resolve the stability and customizability problems I have with the board. Unfortunately, I was not able to figure out how to flash the firmware to the keyboard. The main problem I faced was that the keyboard was not recognized by the QMK Toolkit software (on Windows) even after I put the keyboard into bootloader mode, and even after I started messing with the bootloader firmware using <a href=\"https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/guides/driver_installation_zadig\">Zadig</a>.</p>\n\n<p>After lots of tries, I couldn’t figure out. I think I dodged a bullet, though, because I’m not sure QMK can control the RGB backlighting, which, on this keyboard, is necessary to see the key legends. Fortunately, despite me trying to mess with it, my keyboard still works as well as it did before. It’s not perfect, and I really would like to create a more robust <code>Fn</code> (function key) layer, but I will live with it for now.</p>\n\n<p>🎵 I’m listening to <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/for-her/1499733036?i=1499733045\"><em>Gaslighter</em> by The Chicks</a> again today. It is one of my favorite albums of 2020. Everything is great about it, from the catchy choruses to the close harmonies to the clean production. My favorite part of it is the songwriting, which is fueled with righteous anger and makes for compelling country-pop music.</p>\n\n<p>Today I made the mistake to look up someone I knew while I was in high school. I was reading an article about illegal drugs, and thought about a high school friend’s younger brother who ran into some drug problems about 20 years ago. Sadly, I discovered that he died last year. I can only conjecture, but it seems, based on what else happened to him over the past few years, that drug problems led to his premature death. Learning about what happened to him made me very sad.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"apple-arcade-just-got-a-huge-update-of-new-games-including-some-mobile-classics\">Apple Arcade just got a huge update of new games, including some mobile classics</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362388/apple-arcade-game-subscription-update-monument-valley-threes-iphone-ipad\">As reported by Andrew Webster in <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apple’s gaming subscription service just got a massive influx of new titles. The headliner is Fantasian — the latest release from the creator of Final Fantasy — which is joined by other titles like new versions of NBA 2K and The Oregon Trail, and World of Demons from PlatinumGames. As part of the update, the service is getting two new categories of games: Apple calls them “Timeless Classics” and “App Store Greats.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I literally just canceled my (second) Apple Arcade free trial twelve hours before this announcement. I just can’t seem to get into Apple Arcade at all. For the most part, the reason is that I find my iPhone 12 mini to be too small to be a compelling gaming device. Secondarily, I don’t want to get into a complex, involved game on my iPhone or iPad. I prefer my mobile games to be simple things that can be jumped into and out of, more like the “Timeless Classics” that Apple is now adding to Apple Arcade. It’s too bad for Apple Arcade that I already own almost all of those games.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"fully-vaccinated-people-may-travel-cdc-says\">Fully vaccinated people may travel, CDC says</h1>\n\n<p>As reported by Lena H. Sun and Lori Aratani in <em>The Washington Post</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Federal health officials gave the green light Friday for fully vaccinated people to resume travel as an estimated 100 million Americans have had at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine, and evidence mounts of the shots’ effectiveness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s good news, but it doesn’t make me want to go out and travel by plane or train anytime soon.</p>\n\n<p>I am fully vaccinated, but my kids are not (because, of course, there is no approved vaccine for children yet), and that dramatically limits my desire to travel, eat in indoor restaurants, or do any indoor activities in public unless they are absolutely necessary. I understand that it is probably quite safe for me to do some of these activities (provided I wear a mask, etc.), but it seems to me that doing so would still be (even more) uncomfortable and unpleasant (than it was before).</p>\n\n<p>My wife and I have been talking every day about what is OK or not OK for us to do now that we are vaccinated. Despite both being vaccinated, we are still not comfortable dining in restaurants or staying in hotels (don’t even talk about flying!), but we have realized that we are way behind our friends and acquaintances in terms of risk taking. We remain concerned about our children being explored to the virus, and about the rising and “extremely high” (per <em>The New York Times</em>) COVID-19 risk level our county is currently at. It just doesn’t make sense for us to change our behavior that much yet—at least not until the local COVID infection numbers go down quite a bit, which won’t happen until after a lot more people get vaccinated.</p>\n\n<p>⚾️ For the first time in over a year I have a baseball game on in the background as I work. I hope to get by the with MLB “free game of the day” offering this year, rather than paying to subscribe to the season package. There was no free game for the season opener yesterday, though, so I’m watching a spring training game.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"openai-s-text-generating-system-gpt-3-is-now-spewing-out-4-5-billion-words-a-day\">OpenAI’s text-generating system GPT-3 is now spewing out 4.5 billion words a day</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356180/openai-gpt-3-text-generation-words-day\">James Vincent reports in <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The best-known AI text-generator is OpenAI’s GPT-3, which the company recently announced is now being used in more than 300 different apps, by “tens of thousands” of developers, and producing 4.5 billion words per day. That’s a lot of robot verbiage. This may be an arbitrary milestone for OpenAI to celebrate, but it’s also a useful indicator of the growing scale, impact, and commercial potential of AI text generation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The obvious industry target for auto-text is journalism. It is already being used there for sports reporting, and could probably be used for local government reporting too. There are other areas it will encroach on that are news-adjacent (think financial news or business book digest services like Blinkist), like education and entertainment.</p>\n\n<p>I’m an auditor, and I think that, eventually, auto-text is going to destroy about 50% of our billable hours. Auditors spend a <em>ton</em> of time writing. We document our procedures. We record our work. We summarize our findings. We write reports for our clients. Making sense of all the work, both for our own understanding and for our client’s, for the sake of writing it down, takes a lot of time. Moreover, the simple act of typing it out and, especially, hyperlinking everything together so we support our conclusions, requires a lot of manual work. Some of this work is communicative, but a lot of it (like the hyperlinking part) is mechanical. Consequently, much of it is ripe for automation.</p>\n\n<p>I think, though, that transforming this laborious and time-consuming writing process into something auto-generated by a bot would produce a lot more <em>information</em> but a lot less <em>knowledge</em> than we had before. You gain a lot more understanding how a company, business process, or control works by writing about it than by reading about it. Why? Because writing is <em>thinking</em>. To write well is mentally strenuous. It requires you to think how you would communicate an idea to someone else, notably someone else with a different perspective and different knowledge than you have. At the end of the writing process, you should understand your subject backwards and forwards and from all sides; you could probably describe it in a number of different ways; and you will likely remember the gist of it, and specific nuances about it, for far longer than you would if you had just read about it in a report.</p>\n\n<p>The world won’t end, and few will shed tears, when AI writes audit reports and work papers. Audits cost money, and businesses mostly don’t think they benefit from them. If it makes the auditors less knowledgeable, however, side effects will develop, and those will be long-lasting. Knowledgable auditors help make good control environments possible, which leads to more stable and more solvent companies. Decreasing the understanding of auditors could make systems and processes more unstable and less trustworthy over time. Additionally, knowledgable auditors often move to the business side and go on to manage well-controlled organizations. While the auditor-to-manager career path will likely continue, such moves would not result in the same level of management quality if the auditors don’t have to think as deeply about what they are auditing as they did before the AI text-bots took over. Neither of these side effects bodes particularly well for the people the auditors and the audited companies (and their fancy AI) serve.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"there-is-no-perfect-template-just-pick-one\">There is no perfect template—just pick one</h1>\n\n<p>I stayed up late last night drafting a new, Hugo-driven version of one of my websites. I went from having nothing at all built to having about one third of the site done in a couple hours. The result, I think, will be more plain (and maybe more ugly) than the existing site, but it will be less janky on mobile devices.</p>\n\n<p>I sank a lot of time over the past week looking for a Hugo theme that is perfect for my needs, but I couldn’t find one. For the sake of achieving my simple goal of refreshing my tiny websites, I gave up the goal of visual perfection, and am driving forward with a theme that I think is OK that works well enough for me.</p>\n\n<p>From my perspective, I want my site to be easier to maintain and add content. That is more important to me than having a site that looks really slick. My old websites don’t look slick anymore, anyway: No one is fooled by outdated HTML templates into thinking that my very niche apps are developed by a huge, sophisticated software corporation.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-organizational-rabbit-hole\">The organizational rabbit hole</h1>\n\n<p>This is a short, short version of what happened to me over the past week when I decided to get organized.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Form a desire to organize my project files differently.</li>\n<li>Discover the <a href=\"https://johnnydecimal.com\">Johnny Decimal</a> system.</li>\n<li>Create a taxonomy for my files in a text file.</li>\n<li>Start writing PowerShell script to switch folders based on the Johnny Decimal number</li>\n<li>Start writing a PowerShell script to index all the Johnny Decimal numbers in my folder tree</li>\n<li>Think about working with files from the command line more often</li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://midnight-commander.org\">Midnight Commander</a> for a command line file manager</li>\n<li>Learn a lot of Midnight Commander shortcuts and customizations</li>\n<li>Learn about <a href=\"https://farmanager.com\">Far Manager</a>, which is a lot like Midnight Commander but works much better on Windows</li>\n<li>Run into keyboard shortcut conflicts with Windows Terminal</li>\n<li>Learn about assigning and removing keyboard shortcuts in Windows Terminal</li>\n<li>Start thinking about using <a href=\"http://todotxt.org\">todo.txt</a> from the Windows Terminal, because my <a href=\"https://www.taskpaper.com\">TaskPaper</a> file has been too big for months and is awful to work with</li>\n<li>Tried to find a todo.txt command line app for Windows that works on my machine</li>\n<li>Thought about writing my own todo.txt command line app using an old C# library I created</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>And&hellip;I still haven’t organized anything yet. 😅</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier\">The Falcon and the Winter Soldier 📺</h1>\n\n<p>I watched episode one of <a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/tv-shows/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier/1\"><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a> this week. It’s a show about two <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe\">MCU</a> characters I don’t particularly care that much about, so it wasn’t something I was really looking forward to, but I pay for Disney+ anyway and thought I may as well check it out. Reader, I liked it!</p>\n\n<p>My first impression is that it looks like it cost a zillion dollars. Special-effects-wise, it looks on par with the Marvel movies. Based on that alone, I could see why Disney originally wanted it to premiere first, before <em>WandaVision</em> and whatever other Marvel shows are being developed.</p>\n\n<p>My second impression is that I appreciated that it was trying to tell a Black story as well as a super hero story. I am not optimistic that Sam’s (The Falcon’s) family side story is going to be anything but predictable, but it is nice to see an attempt to give the character some grounding in reality. Race is an issue that touches everything in American life, unfortunately. In some ways, it would be disrespectful to Sam’s character and to the audience not to address that in some way.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t have anything bad to say about the Winter Soldier part of the show, but it isn’t as interesting to me. I expect it to follow a predictable “antihero almost, but doesn’t quite, make good” formula, but maybe the writers will surprise me.</p>\n\n<p>Predictability aside, I’m just glad to have something new and fun to watch.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-menu-key\">The menu key</h1>\n\n<p>I was thinking about creating a training presentation to help my coworkers with keyboards shortcuts, but was dismayed to see that our Lenovo laptop keyboards (which I never use, because I work from home and use external peripherals) don’t even have a menu key. Someone decided that <code>Print Screen</code> was more important, which may even be true, but it doesn’t help me make a good presentation for my coworkers. The menu key alternative, <code>Shift+F10</code> is going to be a very hard sell, especially because <code>F10</code> on the laptop requires the <code>Fn</code> key to be pressed, too.</p>\n\n<p>I have gone from someone who did not use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_key\">menu key</a> on my keyboard for 20+ years (since it was invented in the 1990s) to someone who can’t live without it (on my Windows at least). I made it a point to start using it a few months ago, and now I use it constantly. I recommend that all Windows users with an ANSI or ISO keyboard layout check it out. That key is positioned right underneath your thumb when you use the arrow keys.</p>\n\n<p>🎵 “<a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/canadas-country/pl.f2da318b2e1a4f358f10efc2021cba6e\">Canada’s Country</a>”: I’ve been enjoying this laid-back playlist while I work.

I’m glad I did.</p>\n\n<p>I thought the theatrical release of <em>Justice League</em> was pretty bad, but not quite as bad as the professional movie review consensus was. I figured that the Snyder cut must be better, but I was surprised at how much better it is. Granted, it still isn’t <em>good</em>. It doesn’t fix its pacing problems. It still is not as brisk and pleasurable as the best of the Marvel movies. It doesn’t tell a cohesive story, but it also crams in too many story lines for a non-DC fan to keep track of. It still has some dumb script problems, such every single part of the nonsensical museum height/terrorist bombing blot in the opening Wonder Woman scene, that could have been solved by editing a few sentences of dialog. While not exactly <em>good</em>, it is a good bad movie now. Its reach often exceeds its grasp, but it offers a lot of interesting material to people who are already fans. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to be the kind of movie that would bring a lot new fans in.</p>\n\n<p>It is now very clear to me that Zach Snyder’s vision was dark and wild and weird—definitely too much of all of those things to launch a successful franchise—but Joss Whedon’s contributions were just awful: tasteless, asinine, nonsensical, and insulting to the audience. Whedon’s dialog (notably Superman’s and The Flash’s) and the character moments he created, like the race between The Flash and Superman, are embarrassing to watch and make the characters seem stupid. Snyder’s cut simply had better dialog for them. Simply getting rid of the random <em>people</em> that Whedon put into that nuclear wasteland Russian city—the one that existed in the movie only to be destroyed in a bout of cinematic excess—made the climax bearable. Who needs to worry about a family who shouldn’t be living in a nuclear wasteland anyway when the entire world is already at stake? Whedon really did screw up that movie.</p>\n\n<p>I think that the Snyder Cut works very well for fans of the comics, especially fans of the “what-if” versions of all the famous characters. Some fans, like me, believe that comic book characters are archetypes, and really can be <em>anything</em>, and no representation of them is truly canonical. The grim, dark version of the Justice League is an interesting thought experiment, one of many worth exploring. It is not something I ever felt hung up on as “not the real version” of Superman or whatever. The Snyder Cut isn’t the real version of the DC Universe to me, because nothing is. It’s all just ideas and entertainment anyway.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"alt-f4\">Alt+F4</h1>\n\n<p>I have been using <a href=\"https://www.autohotkey.com\">AutoHotKey</a> for many years, and I never thought until today to map <code>Windows+Q</code> to quit the active app and close the active window. That creates something very similar to Mac’s <code>Command+Q</code> shortcut to Windows.</p>\n\n<p>The default Windows keyboard shortcut for quitting an app is <code>Alt+F4</code>, which is a two hand operation for me. Note that in AutoHotKey, you don’t even need to send that key command; you can use the WinClose function instead:</p>\n\n<p>#q::\nWinClose, A\nReturn</p>\n\n<p>One of the best things Apple has ever done with their support of keyboard shortcuts was to pretend that function keys (<code>F1</code> through <code>F12</code>) don’t exist.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"intel-invests-20-billion-into-new-factories-will-produce-chips-for-other-companies\">Intel invests $20 billion into new factories, will produce chips for other companies</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing\">Chiam Gartenberg reports in <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the company’s “Engineering the Future” announcement today, Gelsinger announced plans to outsource more of Intel’s chip production to third-party foundries; a $20 billion investment into two new fabs in Arizona; and a new branch of the company called Intel Foundry Services, which will see Intel’s foundries produce chips for other companies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Intel has had an awful decade, having missed out on smartphone chips and having stalled out at their 14nm process for years. Still, it is a strategically important company for my country, and I have to ill will toward it, even if I don’t prefer their products right now. I would love to see them become competitive again.</p>\n\n<p>The idea of Intel fabbing chips for other companies is a big deal. Intel has never done that before. It seems to me like it could be the first step of spinning off that part of the business into its own company, and focusing on process shrinks in ways that the fully integrated Intel could not before.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"seven-mass-shootings-in-seven-days\">Seven mass shootings in seven days</h1>\n\n<p>Josh Berlinger of <em>CNN</em> reports today that <a href=\"http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_d3f4ea80ea0d81acb5d30fcf939c3243\">the Colorado attack is the 7th mass shooting in 7 days in the US</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It seemed like there were periods in recent years in which we had a deadly mass shooting in the national news at least every week, if not several times each week. There has been something of a pause due to COVID, for understandable reasons. Unfortunately, we seem to be un-pausing now. Sadly, mass shooting rates in the U.S. seem to be getting back to normal.</p>\n\n<p>But what is “normal?” It is actually hard to know what is normal for gun violence in the U.S. Here’s an interesting factoid from the article about my country’s gun problem:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s unclear how this number of mass shootings compares to an average week in the US.</p>\n\n<p>Though some official gun violence data is available, the US federal government does not have a centralized system or database to track firearm incidents and mass shootings nationwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks some gun violence data, nearly 40,000 people were killed in incidents involving firearms in 2019.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The article omits the reason for this: There are actually <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-government-study-gun-violence/story?id=50300379\">laws against government agencies, such as the CDC, accurately tracking gun violence</a>. That’s just stupid and self-defeating. While dying due to gun violence is incredibly unlikely, statistically speaking, it is also completely unnecessary. We should treat <a href=\"https://usafacts.org/data/topics/security-safety/crime-and-justice/firearms/firearm-deaths/\">all gun deaths</a> as <em>preventable</em> and <em>unacceptable</em>. Only then can we have the mental and moral clarity to do something about it.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"ulysses-and-micro-blog\">Ulysses and Micro.blog</h1>\n\n<p>It is amazing that <a href=\"https://blog.ulysses.app/ulysses-22/\">Ulysses supports posting to Micro.blog now</a>.

On Friday, the agency announced it &ldquo;now recommends that, with universal masking, students should maintain a distance of at least 3 feet in classroom settings.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Previously the guidance stated, &ldquo;Physical distancing (at least 6 feet) should be maximized to the greatest extent possible.&rdquo; The new guidelines still call for 6 feet of distance between adults and students as well as in common areas, such as auditoriums, and when masks are off, such as while eating. And the 6-foot distancing rule still applies for the general public in settings such as grocery stores.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This news is causing a good deal of consternation in my family. COVID cases are going up in our local schools right now. There has been an extremely high risk level in the community for several weeks, and in-person instruction is expanding anyway. Our school systems have been flatly stating that they will open even though they cannot conform with some of the requirements. This change in CDC requirements makes it easier for them to comply.</p>\n\n<p>I think the changing of, and complexity in, the distancing rules makes them seem suspect and less likely to be followed at all. This concern is counterbalanced, however, by my belief that distancing helps very little in the classroom, because every classroom I have seen has poor ventilation. My wife and I are keeping our kids remote until the end of the school year. We are still hopeful enough to consider September as the right time to send them back to in-person learning.</p>\n\n<p>🎵 I’m currently listening to <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/chemtrails-over-the-country-club/1545567745\"><em>Chemtrails over the Country Club</em></a> by Lana Del Ray for the first time.

The new iPad Pros will come with Apple&rsquo;s homemade M1 chips, a Thunderbolt port, and better cameras and screens, according to Bloomberg. They will reportedly come in 11- and 12.9-inch display sizes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s cool. Maybe I’m not a “Pro” but the iPad Air 4 is just about perfect for me. From my layman’s perspective, the A14-based chip in the iPad Air 4 is very similar to the M1, minus some of the cores. The 2020 iPad Pro’s chip (an A12Z) is a generation or two behind that, though it has more cores than the A14 does. Apple obviously needs to remedy that to help justify the iPad Pro’s greater price.</p>\n\n<p>I am thinking that the “Thunderbolt” port is merely following the direction that everything with a USB-C connector is going in: USB 4 compatibility. That, plus more processor cores, sounds good for videographers, podcasters, photographers, and (I guess) gamers. Unfortunately, if Apple doesn’t fix some problems with the Files app (just try transferring a gigabyte-sized file off your iPad to a network share—I’ll wait&hellip;for it to fail), these performance boosts will be hamstrung.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"effective-presentations\">Effective Presentations</h1>\n\n<p>When it comes to creating effective PowerPoint presentations for work, my reach still exceeds my grasp.</p>\n\n<p>I know a lot of important concepts, including the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The slide deck is a visual aid, <em>not</em> the presentation</li>\n<li>Focus on one idea per slide</li>\n<li>Focus on very few visual elements/focus points per slide (e.g., five or six, maximum)</li>\n<li>Light text on a dark background is easier on the eye</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, when I try to apply those ideas, I feel like I’m not getting anywhere. All of my slides look completely conventional: no better than those I created many years ago. I think they are effective, but they are ugly and boring. It does not help that I have to present on topics that are dry and technical in nature. I also feel hamstrung by my company’s PowerPoint template, which is quite busy, focuses attention on the wrong areas of the slide (i.e., the title and the footer), and has (almost completely) black text on a white background.</p>\n\n<p>I think I need to invent a visual style that I can get away with on at least some of my slides:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Full-bleed images that cover the entire slide, and obviate the need for titles or footers on my slides.</li>\n<li>Text boxes that float over the images, or captions that fill in the top title area that is already part of our PowerPoint template.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I just hope, if I do these things, my slides won’t end up looking like tired internet memes.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"team-building-call-with-lindsi-swartz-2021-03-09\">Team-building call with Lindsi Swartz 2021-03-09</h1>\n\n<p>Background:</p>\n\n<p>Health administration</p>\n\n<p>Business school</p>\n\n<p>Filling out testing worksheets.</p>\n\n<p>Looking up procedure codes on findacode.com.</p>\n\n<p>🎵 The Hold Steady’s latest album, <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/open-door-policy/1539020630\">Open Door Policy</a>, is growing on me. I know reviewers love it, because it is a return to form, but I was hoping for something different. It’s hard to say, what, though. Something that’s a mix of fun and depressing, like my favorite Hold Steady lyrics, I guess.</p>\n\n<p>🎵 I loved all of the “Playlists from Visionary Women” that were front-and-center on Apple Music for International Women’s Day today. I’m glad they are still there today on the “Browse” page.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"apple-discontinues-original-homepod-will-focus-on-mini\">Apple discontinues original HomePod, will focus on mini</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-will-focus-on-mini/\">Matthew Panzarino of <em>TechCrunch</em> reports</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apple has discontinued its original HomePod after four years. It says that it will continue to produce and focus on the HomePod mini, introduced last year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I, like many audiophiles, passed on the original HomePod due to its high price and lack of connectivity. I’m sure I would have enjoyed how it sounded, and its size is just right for me, but I would likely have had to buy two of them to be fully satisfied (stereo separation is important to me). At $349 each, that was too expensive.</p>\n\n<p>The smaller, cheaper HomePod mini holds little appeal to me, and seems to be a far less interesting product for the audio engineers at Apple to work on. For all I know, though, it sells in huge numbers, which makes it interesting in and of itself. Maybe a HomePod mini max (ha!) will be released someday, at around $150, which will hit the price/performance sweet spot I am looking for.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-covid-versary\">The COVID-versary</h1>\n\n<p>I guess, based on the occurrence of a President Biden speech, that this week marks <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/Voices/2021/03/12/Joe-Biden-COVID-19-anniversary-speech-full-text/8161615555448/\">the one-year anniversary of COVID-19 in the United States</a>. To me, the baleful presence of COVID-19 has been around for what feels like much, much longer—<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic\">so long that I can’t even remember it clearly</a>.</p>\n\n<p>My COVID panic started in early <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_January_2020\">January</a>, when we thought the disease was only in Wuhan. In America, for a couple weeks at least, it still seemed likely that the disease would never leave China, much like H1N1 and SARS never made a big impact here. For almost three months my mental state caromed between what I think of now as irrational fear and rational fear. I could see the whole year of 2020 play out in my imagination, way before my friends and family could see what was coming, but I could do nothing to stop it, and I could do almost nothing to protect my family from it. All those feelings felt very real and very debilitating, even when almost no one else around me was feeling them.</p>\n\n<p>I had about two months of angst about COVID before it actually hit around here. The last time I went out with friends and family was, I think, on March 14, 2020. We went to see a musical and when out to eat at a crowded restaurant afterward. It was really hard for me to feel comfortable the entire time, but I didn’t want to let everybody down because I was concerned about a pandemic that hadn’t hit our area yet. Less than a week later, my entire family was on lockdown.</p>\n\n<p>Back in January, February, and early March 2020, it didn’t help me at all to have known about the scope and length and shape of prior pandemics, like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu\">Spanish Flu</a>, which I know, from reading family letters, killed a bunch of people in my extended family about a hundred years ago. It didn’t help me at all to know what I should do and buy to prepare for it. It didn’t help me at all that I am smart enough to think for myself and to scrutinize, with a pretty good understanding of the relevant science and statistics, the information and advice experts were providing to us. All of these things just made me feel more uncertain and more cynical about what was going on.</p>\n\n<p>A year later, I am feeling more hopeful. I have the vaccine after all, and am probably (but not definitely) immune to COVID 18. But my <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/monmouth-new-jersey-covid-cases.html\">county is still at extremely high risk level</a>. The numbers are still higher than they were last year when all of us were in a panic. Despite that, all the states, even blue states like mine, are reopening rapidly and throwing caution to the wind, when it would be more prudent to do so more gradually. It makes me nervous that we are giving the virus a chance to circulate long enough to adapt resistance to our vaccines.</p>\n\n<p>I was early in being scared of COVID, and I may be late in getting over that fear. I just hope that, when I look forward from today, whatever fear I feel is merely anxiety over things that will not play out, rather than the accurate foresight into the future that I had late last winter.</p>\n\n<p>There was <a href=\"https://www.nj.com/news/2021/03/large-lakewood-brush-fire-closes-portion-of-gsp.html\">a brush fire yesterday not too far from where I live</a>. Brush fires are incredibly rare where I live, so this is a curiosity to me. We have had dry, windy weather for about two weeks now, which makes wildfire conditions rife. My family was outside yesterday but fortunately we didn’t notice it; we must have been upwind.</p>\n\n<p>I’m probably being a climate-change alarmist right now, but I think we have never had such frequent windstorms in New Jersey as we have had this winter.</p>\n\n<p>I am grateful that the weather has changed from snowy and blustery to warm and calm. I have been able to take a walk after my lunch break for two days in a row. It feels nice.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"this-is-the-reality-of-black-girls-inauguration-poet-says-she-was-tailed-by-guard\">&lsquo;This Is The Reality Of Black Girls&rsquo;: Inauguration Poet Says She Was Tailed By Guard</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://text.npr.org/974362036\">Matthew S. Schwartz reports for NPR</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>To millions of people around the world, the young poet Amanda Gorman represents hope, change and the promise of a better America.</p>\n\n<p>But to a security guard on Friday night, the young African American woman represented a potential threat to public safety.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a sad story. My first thought was that Amanda Gorman could legitimately have been harmed in a situation like this. Then I thought, she should have a bodyguard or an entourage with her at all times for protection. <em>Then</em> I thought, she should not need to! That could ruin her life.</p>\n\n<p>Amanda Gorman is a strong and bold speaker, and deserves the last word on the matter:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;In a sense, he was right,&rdquo; the former National Youth Poet Laureate added. &ldquo;I AM A THREAT: a threat to injustice, to inequality, to ignorance. Anyone who speaks the truth and walks with hope is an obvious and fatal danger to the powers that be.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1 id=\"mermaid-for-flowcharts\">Mermaid 🧜‍♀️ for flowcharts</h1>\n\n<p>Tonight I learned about <a href=\"https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/\">Mermaid</a>, which is a plaintext markup language and renderer for creating flowcharts and other kinds of diagrams.</p>\n\n<p>I want to make flowcharts quickly for my technical projects at work, but i don’t have Visio, and I hate fiddling with a GUI to line up shapes and worry about arrow lengths and so on. The way my mind works, I just want to type out what I want and have software figure out how to lay it out for me. I don’t care that much how it looks, as long as it is simple and makes sense.</p>\n\n<p>Mermaid’s plaintext premise is really cool, and the syntax is flexible enough to not be awful. It is way more flexible than the examples on The Mermaid website originally led me to believe. You can name each shape whatever you like (not just single letter identifiers) and you can define the content (shapes) and relationships (arrows) separately if you want to. The only thing that stinks is that you have to manually insert html break tags (<code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>) for line breaks, because there is no word wrap.</p>\n\n<p>I still need to figure out what the best renderer is for me.

That, indeed, is the life of an auditor.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"gen-lock\">Gen: Lock</h1>\n\n<p>I watched “<a href=\"https://roosterteeth.com/series/gen-lock\">Gen:lock</a>” over the past week. I was disappointed that it introduced a premise-breaking plot development in the penultimate episode. My beef is 100% spoiler-y.</p>\n\n<p>The shows is a <a href=\"https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/tags/mecha\">mecha anime</a>. Its premise is that, in some future war in which big robots piloted by people fight each other, a new type of mech is developed that is remotely controlled by very rare, very special kind of person. That person must bind her mind to the mech through a lot of hand-wavey technology called gen:lock.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is, we learn three things in the final two episodes of season 1 that make the pilots unnecessary:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A person’s mind can uploaded to, and downloaded from, a digital brain</li>\n<li>A digital brain can be copied an indefinite number of times.</li>\n<li>A digital brain is all that is needed to drive a mech</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If one pilot’s mind can be copied, without harming her, and then bound to any number of mechs, then why do we need the pilots at all, once you’ve got the first one’s mind copied? If the pilots aren’t really necessary, why haven’t the characters in charge of the gen:lock program figured that out yet?</p>\n\n<p>I’m not sure I will pick it up again when season 2 comes out. Maybe this kind of anime isn’t for me.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"neera-tanden-is-biden-s-first-cabinet-level-nominee-to-withdraw\">Neera Tanden is Biden’s first Cabinet-level nominee to withdraw</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/3/2/22310271/neera-tanden-biden-omb-withdraws\">Ella Nilson at vox.com reports</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But much of Tanden’s résumé was overshadowed by her proliferous online posting — at least 1,000 tweets raking both Republicans and leftist Democrats over the coals — that Tanden quietly started deleting in November 2020.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I haven’t been following this story, but my interest was piqued when I learned that Neera Tanden’s nomination chances were in jeopardy because of her tweets from the past. People keep getting in trouble for what they post to Twitter. (“Social media” in these cases always is Twitter, too. That is probably just because it is public facing, though it is also a popular place for broadcasting, calling out, and grandstanding.)</p>\n\n<p>It will soon be the conventional wisdom that those who seek high offices—in public service or in private industry—should have no public social media presence, no blog—certainly no Twitter account—maybe no public online presence at all. That bothers me because I think there is value in publishing one’s thoughts to the world, in a blog, vlog, podcast, or whatever other medium I can&rsquo;t even conceive of yet. People have an urge to share and should not feel that they will be punished for it, especially years after they tap the “post” button.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that some people are deliberately awful on social media, and that <em>is</em> a problem, but isn&rsquo;t it also a problem that “the Internet never forgets?” <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten\">The right to be forgotten</a> is at both ridiculous to ask for and essential for people to get along with each other after a certain point. How should we evaluate a person based on what she posted online? Does it matter how long ago a thought was posted? What is fair? I think we are at a cultural crossroads regarding these questions, and may be stuck at that crossroads for a long, long time.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"trust\">Trust</h1>\n\n<p>Trust relies on three things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Competence—can you do something well?</li>\n<li>Benevolence—are you doing good?</li>\n<li>Integrity—will you do the right thing, even when things are bad for you?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I heard this breakdown on a podcast episode earlier this week, and loved the idea so much that I hastily dictated a note to Siri about it (I was in my car at the time), but I can’t recall which podcast I heard it on or who said it. I found an analogous summary of the idea on the Wiley Online Library site, in an abstract about a chapter of the book <em><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119206422.ch21\">Handbook of Principles of Organizational Behavior: Indispensable Knowledge for Evidence‐Based Management, Second Edition</a></em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This chapter focuses on using the concepts of ability, benevolence, and integrity as a means of increasing trust. Ability, benevolence, and integrity are the most critical facets of trustworthiness. They foster a sense of trust in the leader by followers. Ability reflects the knowledge, skills, and aptitudes of a leader, in both technical areas and general management competencies. Benevolence and integrity are aspects of the leader&rsquo;s character, and require more time and attention on the part of followers before they can be reliably judged. In order to increase trust, leaders need to take steps to increase their ability, build their benevolence, and demonstrate their integrity. Leaders can do so on a follower‐by‐follower basis, but can also take steps to create a culture of trustworthiness within their organizations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Breaking down concepts like “trust”—which seem innately understood and obvious—into component parts can be very powerful. It gives you a way “in” when it comes to solving problems dependent on that concept.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"boston-red-sox-s-dustin-pedroia-announces-retirement-from-mlb\">Boston Red Sox&rsquo;s Dustin Pedroia announces retirement from MLB</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/30816259/boston-red-sox-dustin-pedroia-announces-retirement-mlb\">Joon Lee of ESPN reports</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Boston Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia, who hasn&rsquo;t played since 2019 because of a knee injury suffered two seasons earlier, announced his retirement Monday.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Could it have ended better and I finished my career the right way? Yeah of course,&rdquo; Pedroia said on a Zoom call with the media. &ldquo;But there was a reason I was the first one dressed at 5:30 for a 7 o&rsquo;clock game. I always tell my teammates that you never know if the game is going to start early. My biggest thing in my mind was that this could be my last game and you don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s the best way I approached it from Little League on. I had the best time playing.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As a Red Sox fan, Pedroia’s retirement is no surprise. He hasn’t been physically able to play for years, since he got injured by a Manny Machado slide at second base. It is sad nonetheless. In his prime, he was fun and exciting to watch, and embodied the quality I enjoy seeing the most as a fan: “the love of the game.”</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"nyu-researchers-find-no-evidence-of-anti-conservative-bias-on-social-media\">NYU researchers find no evidence of anti-conservative bias on social media</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260269/anti-conservative-bias-social-media-no-evidence-nyu-research\">Kim Lyons reports in <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The contention that social media as an industry censors conservatives is now, as we speak, becoming part of an even broader disinformation campaign from the right, that conservatives are being silenced all across American society,” the report’s lead researcher Paul Barrett said in an interview with The Verge. “This is the obvious post-Trump theme, we’re seeing it on Fox News, hearing it from Trump lieutenants, and I think it will continue indefinitely. Rather than any of this going away with Trump leaving Washington, it’s only getting more intense.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is one of those studies that <em>may</em> help future historians sort through the mess we are living through now. It is pretty obvious to me that there is a conservative bias on social media rather than a liberal one. The shocking election in 2016 of a mendacious “conservative” social media gasbag is enough proof. That he wasn’t deplatformed until he lost the 2020 election, despite sowing devision and inciting violence on social media platforms, is further proof of it.</p>\n\n<p>I bristle now at hearing or seeing the word “conservative” describe the people running a disinformation campaign against their fellow citizens. There’s nothing “conservative” about this influential and dangerous wing of the Republican Party, which is undermining the basic traditions and institutions of society. I identify strongly as a political progressive, but I am also quite conservative in how I think that people should behave publicly and how ethically and transparently political institutions should be run.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"fullmetal-alchemist\">Fullmetal Alchemist</h1>\n\n<p>While I have been working a ton lately, I can’t work every second of the day. I have been watching the “Fullmetal Alchemist” anime series (there are two), mostly late at night, to unwind.</p>\n\n<p>I watched the entirety of “Fullmetal Alchemist”—which is the first anime adaptation of the manga—first. Because it veers widely off of the plot of the manga (which, since I am not a manga reader, I don’t care about), it seems to be widely considered the lesser of the two adaptations. I think that sells it short. There are lots of sad, thought-provoking episodes, especially toward the beginning of the run, in which characters and the audience question what it means to be human, and what is the value of a human soul. These questions build up to big ideas and set pieces by the end, which is satisfying. There are some structural problems with how the story is told—mostly in the way the timeline, pacing, and character balance shift between the beginning, middle, and end of the series—but there is no problem that majorly detracts from the series as a whole. You could quibble that a lot of the theory behind how the magic system works doesn’t make any sense, which is vital to the overall theme of the series. Consider, however, that it is a <em>magic system</em>, you have to suspend disbelief quite a bit to begin with, and of course it doesn’t make perfect sense.</p>\n\n<p>I am almost done watching the second adaptation, “Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood”, which stays true to the manga plot and is generally lauded as the better of the two anime series. At this point, I don’t think of it as “better” but it certainly is much different. The stakes in “Brotherhood” are much higher, the characters are more tightly integrated throughout the series, and the tone overall is funnier and less sad, despite the raised stakes and some (somewhat) more mature relationship elements between childhood friends/teenage-phenoms Edward and Winry. Despite these advantages, “Brotherhood” is far more cartoony in style, which I don’t prefer. It uses <em>chibi</em> (super deformed) style far more heavily than the first adaptation did, which I find distracting—the characters are often blowing their stacks in anger or are extremely embarrassed or go into some of other extreme, but emotionally and visually, that takes me out of the story a bit. That is a relatively small demerit, however, and it is offset by the increased complexity of the story.</p>\n\n<p>I am eager to see how “Brotherhood” ends, and would recommend that everyone try watching both series, especially the first one, because it is very good despite being the less-loved one.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"little-voice\">Little Voice</h1>\n\n<p>My wife and I recently discovered the Apple TV+ show “<a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/show/little-voice/umc.cmc.4x932osv992wjjdq7ce12za2r\">Little Voice</a>” and very much enjoy it.</p>\n\n<p>It is different in pace and tone from other shows (like “Curb Your Enthusiasm”) that we have been watching lately. While there is a lot going on in each episode, the pace feels slow and thoughtful, as if the show is focused mainly on the growth of its characters and on illustrating (a version of) the New York City music scene. I would not recommend watching “Little Voice” for its main plot, because it appears to follow the well-worn path of “talented-but-unknown artist slowly becomes successful.” That said, there are a ton of great character moments throughout.</p>\n\n<p>The main draw of the show is the music, most of which are songs written by series co-creator Sara Bareilles. There is a lot of music performance in each episode. All these sections look great, sound great, and are integrated completely naturally into the story. However, they serve as the primary reason why the pace is slow. If you don’t like the music, then the show will not be for you.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I think that “Little Voice” is under-rated. It didn’t blow up like “Ted Lasso” (which is, indeed, great) or “Central Park” (which is also great), but is my third-favorite Apple TV+ series thus far.</p>\n\n<p>I have been super, super, super busy today, and it just won’t stop. It looks like I’ll be working a lot of overtime&hellip;like right now. At least, once the kids go to bed, I can put my headphones back on and enjoy some music while I work.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-business-of-influenece-with-mkbhd\">The Business of Influenece with MKBHD</h1>\n\n<p>I found this <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22231657/mkbhd-marques-brownlee-interview-youtube-creator-influencer-decoder\">fairly long interview on <em>The Verge</em></a> with Marques Brownlee (<a href=\"https://youtube.com/c/mkbhd\">MKBHD on YouTube</a>) to be very interesting:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But what looks effortless and fun to the viewer is often the result of careful planning and investment. YouTubers are entrepreneurs, and Brownlee — my guest on today’s episode of Decoder — talks that talk with the best of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Marques Brownlee could be described as “tech reviewer” or a “social media influencer” or a “YouTuber.” I don’t watch all his videos, but I have checked in with his YouTube channel periodically since I first saw him (as a college student!) on an episode of TWiT. While he is telegenic and charismatic, he also presents himself as someone with a strong sense of ethics who is very smart and thoughtful about he approaches his business. This interview gives a pretty long look into Marques Brownlee’s professional world.</p>\n\n<p>My wife, who is a high school teacher, recently reported to me that one of the top “professions” that teens want to go into is “social media influencer.” That is kind of eyeroll-inducing to me, but I suppose it is as realistic and as meaningful an aspiration as “famous writer” was to me. It is important to know how much work goes into that sort of job, and how much time, investment, and infrastructure goes into keeping up with the competition.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t really want to criticize <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/news/tweetbot-6-moves-to-subscription-pricing/\">TapBots for making TweetBot version 6 a subscription app</a>.

Let’s Quickly Get Them into People’s Arms.</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://kottke.org/21/01/the-covid-19-vaccines-are-amazing-lets-quickly-get-them-into-peoples-arms\">Jason Kottke’s blog post</a> offers some great advice that we all should heed:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So what can you do about this right now? 1. Stop worrying about the variants until the experts let us know we have something to worry about. 2. If you are eligible for the vaccine, get it! 3. Spread the word about vaccine availability in your area. Yesterday Vermont opened signups for vaccination appointments for all Vermonters 75 and older, and I texted/emailed everyone I could think of who was over 75 or who had parents/relatives/friends who are over 75 to urge them to sign up or spread the word. 4. Continue to wear a mask (a better one if possible), wash your hands, social distance, stay home when possible, don’t spend time indoors w/ strangers, etc. Thanks to these remarkable vaccines, real relief is in sight — let’s keep on track and see this thing through.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My family is now obsessed with wearing two layers of masks, which I tried but couldn’t get to work with my glasses on. I am more interested in finally being able to buy and wear N95, KN95, and KN94 (my favorite) masks, which are more effective than the cloth masks and surgical masks I have been stuck with since February.</p>\n\n<p>In New Jersey, vaccine distribution is both successful (my wife, who is a teacher, got her first dose yesterday) and a total mess (it is very hard to get an appointment, there is no central coordination of virus distribution, and any effective effort on prioritizing inoculations for higher-risk groups is effective gone). If my family is a good indicator of people’s behavior, then lots of us New Jerseyans keep hammering away at the appointment systems, trying to get a better appointment slot, which further jams up the system.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote a support email to <a href=\"https://ulysses.app\">Ulysses</a> last week inquiring about <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">micro.blog</a> support. I got a response that said that it was on their “immediate roadmap” which is pretty exciting and still slightly mysterious.🤞</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"record-low-flu-cases-show-how-covid-19-is-more-contagious-and-less-forgiving-experts-say\">Record low flu cases show how COVID-19 is more contagious and &lsquo;less forgiving,&rsquo; experts say</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/11/amid-coronavirus-flu-cases-record-low/4127197001/\">This article in <em>USA Today</em></a> confirms my suspicions that all the anti-COVID measures would drastically reduce the prevalence of seasonal flu in the U.S.:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>During the 2019 flu season from Sept. 29 to Dec. 28, the CDC reported more than 65,000 cases of influenza nationwide. During the same period last year, the agency reported 1,016 cases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I get a vaccine every year for the flu—and luckily have not caught it since I was in elementary school—but other than that, I never think about it. My dream right now is that the COVID vaccine be the same kind of thing: a prick on the arm once a year, and otherwise nothing much to think about.</p>\n\n<p>🎵 I’m trying out <a href=\"https://plexamp.com\">PlexAmp</a> again, and am listening to Herbie Hancock’s “Gershwin’s World” (in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lossless\">ALAC</a>) which has been in my library for over twenty years and probably hasn’t been listened to since 2000.</p>\n\n<p>I made the mistake today of turning off my home media server (HP N54L) for a few minutes to see how quiet my office is without its fan running. Now I can’t help but be annoyed by it. 😀</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"barry-season-3-delay-has-allowed-season-4-scripts-to-be-finished-ahead-of-schedule\">Barry Season 3 Delay Has Allowed Season 4 Scripts to be Finished Ahead of Schedule</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/barry-season-4-scripts-finished/\">Per Ethan Anderton on <em>SlashFilm</em>, quoting Bill Hader:</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Right when the lockdown happened in March, we were a week away from shooting. So the last time I was in a room with a lot of people was the table read episodes one and two of season three, and we were ready to go. Then it all got shut down. Season three is completely written, ready to go, and then during this time we actually went and wrote season four. So we have both of those kinda done. We’re just waiting until we can start shooting again.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>“Barry” is a <em> sui generis</em> example of peak TV. It takes a lot of risks in terms of both plot and tone, and so far they have all paid off. I certainly couldn’t predict how Bill Hader and Alex Berg were going to write their way out of the end of Season 2 of “Barry,” but I guess they cracked it and then some.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://musicforprogramming.net/#\">Music for Programming</a> is definitely not for me, but I <em>love</em> the all-text site design.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"why-did-i-get-a-webcam-again\">Why did I get a webcam again? 😂</h1>\n\n<p>I just got a Logitech C920 webcam to use for video calls at work.

I pushed the news of it away as best I could, so I am less informed than I otherwise would be, but I am sad, angry, and ashamed nonetheless.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-rioters-incite/2021/01/06/0acfc778-5035-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html\">Per Philip Rucker in <em>The Washington Post</em></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The “American carnage” that Donald Trump vowed to end at the dawn of his presidency was revived in terrifying, treacherous form at its sunset Wednesday, as Trump made a fiery last stand and incited his supporters to storm and sack the U.S. Capitol as part of an attempted coup.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t even know how to comment on this event without seeming glib, but I feel compelled to say something anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I am, by trade, an auditor. One thing auditors are trained to investigate is called “tone at the top,” which represents the values expressed by the top management of a company which are expected from everyone who reports up to them.</p>\n\n<p>After auditing for years, I have discovered that “tone at the top” is almost everything you need to know about an organization to get an idea how well and how ethically it is operated. Ethics and decency from the top of an organization really do trickle down all the way to the bottom and permeate it entirely. Moreover, they are strongly indicative of the organization’s *solvency*—its ability to hold together as a going concern over time.</p>\n\n<p>When the “tone at the top” is selfish, vain, petty, petulant, aggrieved, unethical, amoral, and violent—as Trump’s has been—that tone trickles down to the whole organization, and pollutes the thoughts and corrupts the actions of the people within it. Unfortunately in this case, the “organization” is not just the Executive Branch, not just the federal government, and not just the Republican Party: it is the entire United States of America. What’s more, because the U.S. is a vastly influential country, the corruption and willful deceit at the head of it spills over into the rest of the world.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like I have known this from the beginning—before the slow-moving coup even started—because I understood what the “tone at the top” was, and knew that it was vitally important. <em>Knowing</em> this, sadly, is not enough, because in a democracy a majority of people need to know this for things to turn out better. Being <em>able</em> to know this, like being able to discern the “tone at the top” as a new auditor, is a rare gift. It requires a trait that is not easily acquired, but is so difficult to teach and to learn that it is often considered to be innate: <em>shrewdness</em>.</p>\n\n<p>That’s because “tone at the top” isn’t always as blatantly obvious as Trump’s vitriolic tweets and shambolic rally speeches. Understanding what the “tone at the top” <em>really</em> is, it requires a combination of healthy skepticism, decent powers of observation, and the knowledge of how things are supposed to work. You have to understand both context <em>and</em> subtext; subtext is much harder to grasp than context, but is often the more important to the two. You have to interpret people’s words <em>and</em> actions, and compare them to each other to see if the actions follow the words. You also have to have some kind of ethical foundation—which may be laws of the state, societal norms, or virtue ethics— on which to base your conclusions.</p>\n\n<p>The human mind has evolved to do a lot of this analysis automatically. Consider that establishing whether you trust another person is, and always has been, an essential part of human interaction. But, like a lot of thought processes that are largely automatic, many times mental shortcuts are taken and the wrong choice is made. To be able to second-guess these automatic thought processes takes intellect, some degree of guidance, and a willingness to think a little harder.</p>\n\n<p>I would not be surprised to learn that many of the people trying to unlawfully overturn the election—not counting the elected officials who are operating out of cynical self-interest—really do think they are making an ethical decision, and really do think they are doing the right thing. They just trusted the wrong person, or made the wrong decision about voting for or supporting, because they lack the shrewdness and imagination to discern that the “tone at the top” really does matter, and that bad words from a lazy president really will lead to riots in the streets.</p>\n\n<p>I realized today that in, ACL, a scripting language I use at work, I have been using a mixture of <code>PascalCase</code> and <code>snake_case</code> (like this: <code>Table_Name</code>) that is the worst of both worlds in terms of typing difficulty. Fortunately, ACL is not case-sensitive.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"zero\">Zero</h1>\n\n<p>I am a big fan of <a href=\"https://medium.com/[@kevinrose](https://micro.blog/kevinrose)/introducing-zero-a-new-app-to-help-you-fast-209935e8245d\">the Zero app</a>, which is a tracker for intermittent fasting. It is free, attractive, and has just enough features to keep me engaged and motivated, and no more.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, my favorite feature is its Apple Watch complication, which fills up a ring (similar to the Activity app’s rings) as you progress through your fasting period. I find that filling that ring every day, and the app&rsquo;s cheerful notifications every morning, really help motivate me to stop snacking or having an extra meal at night.</p>\n\n<p>The only thing I don&rsquo;t like about it is that it requires you to set up an account with an email address. While the company behind it does not appear to be abusing my privacy in any way, I would prefer that they didn’t require an account. Perhaps they will adopt Sign in with Apple when it becomes available this fall.</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in Zero, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zero-fasting-tracker/id1168348542?mt=8\">download it from the iOS App Store</a>.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"thoughts-on-apple-card\">Thoughts on Apple Card</h1>\n\n<p>I got the Apple Card about a week ago, and just started using it this weekend. Here are some initial thoughts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I very much like the security and privacy features Apple Pay and the Apple Card. I try to use Apple Pay whenever I can to take advantage of most of these features, no matter what card I was using.</li>\n<li>I very much like the enhancements to the Wallet app on my iPhone to review transactions and spending.</li>\n<li>2% cash back on all Apple Pay purchases seems like a pretty good benefit to me.</li>\n<li>3% back on Apple transactions seems a little stingy, considering that Amazon and Target offer 5% back when you use their branded cards. I would get a much better cash-back rate buying an Apple product on Amazon, using my Amazon.com Visa.</li>\n<li>The interest rate offered to me was the lowest that they offer, and it is a between two and three percentage points lower than the other cards I have. I never carry a balance, so it doesn’t mean much to me.</li>\n<li>I had a false-alarm fraud alert shortly after I set it up. I made it my default on my Apple account, and a $30 annual subscription fee trigged a fraud alert. I contacted Apple Card support via iMessage, and cleared up the problem.</li>\n<li>Buying different things changes the color of the card in the Wallet app, which is amusing. The colors correspond to the spending charts.</li>\n<li>I had a lot of trouble adding the card to my Apple Watch. It took lots of fiddling with settings, but, fortunately, I did not have to unpair and repair the Apple Watch to my iPhone.</li>\n<li>The titanium card is boring and heavy. I expect to never use it. Its best feature is that my card number is not printed on it.</li>\n<li>Some common features are missing: a website, integration with personal finance applications, and joint accounts (or authorized users).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Blog post: SwiftoDo Development Notes, July 2018 <a href=\"https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/swiftodo-development-notes-july-2018/\" title=\"https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/swiftodo-develop…-notes-july-2018/\">https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/swiftodo-develop…-notes-july-2018/</a></p>\n\n<p>Blog post: <a href=\"https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/swiftodo-development-notes-july-2018/\">SwiftoDo Development Notes, July 2018</a></p>\n\n<h1 id=\"ready-player-one-by-ernest-cline\">📚 Ready Player One, by Ernest Cline</h1>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, I completed reading _<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One\">Ready Player One</a>_ by Ernest Cline. It was the first novel that I had read in a while, as I have been reading mostly nonfiction in recent years. I discovered the book from an <a href=\"https://twit.tv/shows/triangulation/episodes/322\">episode of the “Triangulation” podcast in which Leo Laporte interviewed author Andy Weir</a>, who enthusiastically recommended the book.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I enjoyed the book. The prose is efficient and the pacing is swift. I thought it started out strong, and I liked the world building and the build-up of suspense in the early chapters. After a while, though, I tired of all the 1980s video game and movie references, and wanted the book to end. While I was about three quarters through the book, I referred to it as “the reading equivalent to watching somebody else play video games”. For me, the stakes felt too low, and the characterizations were too thin, to make a lasting impression. Still, I had fun reading it, at least most of the way through.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"introducing-the-new-yorker-crossword-puzzle\">Introducing The New Yorker Crossword Puzzle</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/crossword/puzzles-dept/2018/04/30\">The New Yorker just launched a crossword puzzle</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most of our readers have e-mail addresses now, and the Web has given us the space to try new things—and to try old things again. In that spirit, we’re launching another crossword, online this time, and in the American style. It’ll be weekly, just like the magazine: a new one every Monday morning</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am a daily crossword puzzle player. I enjoy them, though I am not terribly good at them, because I love word games and have read that crosswords help keep your mind sharp into old age.</p>\n\n<p>The New Yorker puzzle is a <em>tiny</em> bit more challenging than I would like (as I said, I’m not a strong player), but I’m happy there’s another source of crossword puzzles (beyond the New York Times, which I also subscribe to) coming may way.</p>\n\n<p>I hope they will someday move it into their iOS app. The scrolling behavior, which affects the on-page keyboard, is annoying on mobile.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"prolific-apple-supply-chain-analyst-ming-chi-kuo-departs-kgi-securities-likely-to-focus-on-companies-other-than-apple\">Prolific Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo departs KGI Securities, likely to focus on companies other than Apple</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/30/prolific-apple-supply-chain-analyst-ming-chi-kuo-departs-kgi/\">Kuo’s departure</a> comes hot off the heels of <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/13/apple-memo-on-leaks-leaks/\">Apple’s recent “leaked” memo</a> about leaking that threatened the leaky leaders who leak.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why has Ming-Chi Kuo, arguably one of the most popular technology analysts in the world, decided to move on? One possible reason is that his sources have done likewise, or perhaps have even been removed in light of Apple’s recent memo and strong stance against leaks — supply chain or otherwise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wondered why myself, and figured that Apple has either threatened him, or his sources, with criminal lawsuits. I, for one, wouldn’t mind if Apple finally closed up all the leaks in its supply chain. While these leaks may benefit Apple investors, they don’t really benefit Apple fans that much.</p>\n\n<p>Blog post: <a href=\"https://mjdescy.me/2018/04/28/swiftodo-development-notes-april-2018/\">SwiftoDo Development Notes, April 2018</a></p>\n\n<h1 id=\"how-we-got-to-now\">How We Got To Now</h1>\n\n<p>I recently finished reading Steen Johnson’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/books/review/how-we-got-to-now-by-steven-johnson.html\">How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World</a>. It was a breezy and pleasurable read, full of interesting information. Johnson’s writing is clear, concise, and engaging throughout.</p>\n\n<p>As a huge nerd who spent a lot of time in childhood perusing a science and technology encyclopedia, and a lot of time in my teens watching tech-related documentaries on Discovery and TLC (before those networks drifted to reality TV), I already knew a lot of the material. Still, it’s a wonderful read to anyone who loves the “history of ideas course” way of looking at disparate, seemingly unrelated things in everyday life, and drawing a through line that connects them all. Plus I learned new phrases that describe these unintended and intended technological and cultural developments—“hummingbird effects” and “the adjacent possible”—that I particularly like.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"i-miss-caesar-salad\">I miss Caesar salad</h1>\n\n<p>It seems to me that massive outbreaks of food borne illness are becoming more and more common. That <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-outbreak-worsens-98-people-now-sick-n869681\">our current, worsening outbreak</a> is the <em>second</em> E. Coli outbreak tied to my favorite type of lettuce in the past six months or so, and it is so virulent, is making me feel worried about our food system, and pessimistic about my country’s will to improve it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>An outbreak of E. coli food poisoning linked to romaine lettuce has widened and has now made at least 98 people sick, federal health officials said Friday.</p>\n\n<p>More than half have had to be hospitalized because the strain of E. coli causing this outbreak is an especially nasty one, the officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said.</p>\n\n<p>People in 22 states have reported E. coli infections linked to the outbreak, the CDC and FDA said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m no expert in this, but I feel like we have several problems in our food system that have, in the past few decades, started to compound in dangerous ways that we should have seen coming. Some of these problems include overcrowding of animals, overuse of antibiotics in livestock, and over-concentration in production and processing. When bad hygiene infects food, it’s worse now than it used to be. The bacteria are more resistant to antibiotics, and the food, and food borne illness, is distributed all across the country.</p>\n\n<p>Another annoyance to me, as a someone who has eaten some raw eggs (usually in cookie dough or homemade eggnog) and rare meat over the years, is that I have <em>never</em> gotten a food borne illness from those activities. I have, however, gotten terribly ill several times from eating restaurant salads, probably due to unwashed hands or vegetables. There are menu warnings about undercooked meat in every restaurant I go to, but none about the danger of eating unwashed vegetables.</p>\n\n<p>I am impatiently awaiting the day I can eat Caesar salads again.</p>\n\n<p>While I was on vacation, I wrote a series of blog posts about all my old speaker systems.

				"content_text": "The latest episode of [Accidental Tech Podcast](https://atp.fm) has [a great discussion about lossless music](https://overcast.fm/+R7DXCWO3Y/26:33), which is coming to Apple Music next month.\n\nI am 1000% the target audience for lossless and hi-res audio, and very excited for [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/) to stream CD quality audio (and sometimes 24bit/96KHz). Even I readily admit I can’t hear the difference most of the time; but sometimes I can, especially on my best equipment. Moreover, I like the idea of getting the best possible quality up to my capacity to hear it (meaning “CD quality” not “hi-res”).\n\n\nI look forward to reading the 2021 M1 iMac reviews later, even though I will likely never buy that computer. It’s the sort of thing I _would_ want if my family were structured more around, say, a central computing location in the family room or something. We all have iPads instead.\n\n\n# WebEx has virtual backgrounds?!\nA software update at work pushed out the virtual backgrounds feature for WebEx. Since my home office—at least the part of it that is _behind_ me and not under my control— is a mess, I enabled it. \n\nSadly, it looks pretty awful. The background mostly leaves a halo around me un-obscured; sometimes it clips portions of my face or shoulder off. I have a very high-end laptop and a “very good” Logitech webcam (all webcams are terrible, I think), so I have concluded that WebEx’s technology is way behind Zoom’s, which does the virtual backgrounds flawlessly. I think I will leave virtual backgrounds on, for privacy reasons, and hope no one minds the weird visual side effects.\n\n\nI did not have to wait long for the [Apple Music announcement](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/) to drop.\n\n\nApple Music can release its [rumored lossless tier](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439885/apple-music-tease-hi-fi-lossless-music-streaming) any minute now. I’m waiting with my best headphones. I don’t care at all about spatial audio or Dolby Atmos, though, so I hope that isn’t the only kind of thing coming.\n\n\n# Apple is Poised to Lose its Antitrust Battle\nI think that Apple is going to lose whatever antitrust cases are eventually brought against it in the EU and in the US. I don’t actually think Apple _should_ lose, because I don’t think it is correct to call Apple a monopoly.\n\nThe general antitrust argument against Apple is that its App Store platform is too locked down, and that is unfair because Apple is a monopoly (insert eye roll here) of its own platform. App is a platform owner. Of course it has a “monopoly” over the platform it owns. That doesn’t make it a monopoly in the overall marketplace. Moreover, while iOS is undoubtedly popular, it is a _minority_ smartphone platform, which in the broadest legal terms that I understand, makes monopoly-related antitrust law not apply to them.\n\nApp developers have to accept Apple’s terms, and pay a pretty large commission to Apple, to distribute apps in the store or to take in-app purchases. That may not feel fair to developers, but I can’t take seriously the arguments that it is illegal. It is the same way that game consoles work. Will we go after Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft next? Shouldn’t they open up their game consoles to alternative payment systems and alternate app stores, too? I have heard of no one seriously arguing this.\n\nThe most compelling argument against Apple’s App Store requirements is that Apple demands too much money from developers for distribution and payment solutions that other companies now offer at lower prices. I am sympathetic to this argument because I too think Apple should have lowered its commission over the years, as marginal costs for these technologies and services have declined. However, the size of Apple’s cut is not really at issue here. Apple, rather clumsily, lowered its commission for a majority of its developers to 15%, starting in January 2021, but the antitrust talk just keeps rolling on.\n\nThe second most compelling argument against Apple is that it uses its platform-owner advantage to position its own software and services over third-party competitors. Again, I sympathize. Apple Sherlocks developers sometimes, and can position its own software and services over anyone else’s. So does Microsoft (ever use Windows?). Amazon exercises a tremendous advantage over third party sellers in its online marketplace.\n\nI could argue that even Linux vendors, such as Ubuntu, position their own, preferred software over that of third-party developers. Software platform owners always have advantages over third parties that operate on their platform. Extracting as much value from that as is possible is the entire point of creating and owning a platform. I think it only becomes an antitrust problem when a company has majority market share, which Apple does not have.\n\nIf developers can’t accept Apple’s terms, then they shouldn’t. They should develop for Android instead, which has the majority market share anyway, or create progressive web apps. (Remember, the web is an app platform, too, not just a way to collect credit card payments for software.) If developers “need” to develop for iOS because iOS users, on average, spend way more money on apps than Android users, then that just shows the value Apple’s marketplace has, and _is_ worth paying for.\n\nDespite my views, I still think Apple is poised to lose any legal actions about them regarding monopoly. It won’t lose based on the merits of whatever case is brought against it; it will lose because enough political sentiment is against Apple, at least in this area, and that is all that matters. Perhaps all the tech giants will fall under this scrutiny, and all will be forced to open up their platforms more widely, and will be forced to renounce their first-party advantage when distributing applications and features. I just don’t see that actually happening, and if it does happen, I don’t think it will benefit anybody in the way government regulators would expect. It could even stifle the development of the next generation of technology platforms.\n\n\n# Is a higher-quality Apple Music tier on the way?\n[I hope so.](https://sixcolors.com/link/2021/05/is-a-higher-quality-apple-music-tier-on-the-way/) I am a sucker for lossless codecs, even though I probably can’t hear the difference between them and AAC-256.\n\n\nI have been using SQL for 25 years and I just learned today that `SELECT [...] FROM Table1, Table2` is called a “[cross join](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-basics/sql-server-cross-join/)” an can also be expressed as `SELECT [...] FROM Table1 CROSS JOIN Table2`. 🤦 In my defense, I must say that I have only had to use a cross join a few times in my entire career.\n\n\nI unblocked Reddit.com earlier this week because the domain keeps coming up in tech question-related search results. After only a few days, I’m back looking at mechanical keyboards and expensive headphones on Reddit like an addict. I just blocked the domain again.\n\n\n# ⌨️ Durgod Zeus Engine Upgrade\nTo my complete surprise, I discovered today that Durgod released an update to their keyboard configuration: Durgod Zeus Engine. The interface looks a lot better, and it is a little easier to use. They didn’t change the keyboard hardware driver to support function layers, which is unfortunately. I really want that. (Honestly, what I want is the ObinsKit software that powers the Anne Pro 2 to apply work on it.)\n\nI set up a new RGB color scheme and remapped my CapsLock to Control, saved them to the keyboard’s local profile, and (out of habit) configured the Zeus Engine to _not_ start every time I log on. I plugged my keyboard into my USB hub and will keep my fingers crossed that it will work reliably now.\n\n\n# Report: Apple’s M2 chips may launch as soon as July 2021\n[Napier Lopez reports in _The Next Web_](https://thenextweb.com/news/report-apples-m2-chips-may-launch-as-soon-as-july-2021):\n\n> Apple only just released its new iMacs featuring the acclaimed M1 ARM-based processor, but according to a report from Nikkei, the company plans to launch M2 as soon as July.\n\nI don’t know anything in particular about Apple’s plans, but it seems crazy to me to expect a faster chip at this time. What I would expect is more I/O, driven by more cores and supported by more RAM. Of course, I could be wrong. Maybe Apple can overvolt the M1 to get more speed out of it, and will call it by another name.\n\n\nI am very conservative about cities re-opening too soon, considering the pandemic has not ended. But [NYC reopening on July 1](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/29/new-york-city-mayor-bill-de-blasio-says-the-city-will-re-open-100percent-on-july-1.html) almost seems reasonable to me. Time will tell.\n\n\n🎵 I’m going to lean into my New Jersey-ness today and listen to a ton of Bruce Springsteen. First album up: [_The Wild, The Innocent, & the E Street Shuffle_](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-wild-the-innocent-the-e-street-shuffle/186149850). This is one of Springsteen’s records that I never think to listen to, but, of course, it’s great. It was made back when Springsteen still wrote songs with a torrent of stream-of-consciousness-style lyrics like a verbose street poet.\n\n\n# Microsoft is changing the default Office font and wants your help to pick a new one\n[Per Tom Warren In _The Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407297/microsoft-office-new-default-font-2022):\n\n> Microsoft is changing its default Office font next year and wants everyone to help pick the new default. While there are more than 700 font options in Word, Microsoft has commissioned five new custom fonts for Office, in a move away from the Calibri font that has been the default in Microsoft Office for nearly 15 years.\n\nI am unusually attached to Calibri so I am not looking forward to this change. Then again, at work I often have to publish using Arial Narrow, which I think is objectively awful in terms of aesthetics and legibility, so it probably won’t affect me too much.\n\n\n# Amazon Vine Review: PomeloHome Bread Knife | 8\" Serrated Stainless Steel Bread Knife | German High Carbon Steel Serrated Knife\n## 4 Stars\n### Looks great, but I don’t love the shape of the handle\nOverall, this bread knife is pretty good, but its straight shape provides poor knuckle clearance, which makes cutting loaves with hard bottom crusts more difficult than it should be. A curved or tapered blade is a better design.\n\nThe coolest thing about this knife is that it is one piece of metal from tip to handle. That is appealing to me in terms of durability, especially because I am in the middle of getting rid of a set of knives from another brand because their handles are falling apart.\n\nI could not tell it from the product photos, but the shape of the handle is roughly triangular: it is slimmer at the bottom than at the top. It looks cool in photos, but it isn’t the best ergonomically for me because there is a less surface area than I am used to to grip on the bottom of the knife.\n\nThe blade is made of high-carbon steel, which is exactly what you want in a kitchen knife because it promises to retain sharpness for a long time.\n\n\n# The Sequence 🎮\nYesterday I decided to re-play a game I loved a few years ago called _[[The Sequence]](http://ombgames.com/?p=121)_. It is a puzzle game where you, essentially, build a machine with various component parts to move a ball (well, the game calls it a “binary cell”) from one part of the screen to another. It sounds simple, and it starts out fairly simple, but it becomes very challenging as you progress. It’s the sort of game a programmer, or anyone who enjoyed _[Human Resource Machine](https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine)_ would enjoy.\n\n\n# Fez 🎮\nI am delighted that I discovered a video game that is [new to the Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/fez-switch/), but not at all new to the world, called [Fez](http://www.fezgame.com). This is the game’s official blurb:\n\n> Gomez is a 2D creature living in a 2D world. Or is he? When the existence of a mysterious 3rd dimension is revealed to him, Gomez is sent out on a journey that will take him to the very end of time and space. Use your ability to navigate 3D structures from 4 distinct classic 2D perspectives.\n\nIt is a 2D puzzle platformer where your character can rotate the environment left or right 90 degrees at a time, but you always interact with the environment in two dimensions. Some of the puzzles are quite challenging, but I think that the most hidden secrets that you can get from solving the hardest puzzles are all optional to completing the game. It’s a charming game, and easily my favorite Switch game of this year so far.\n\n\n# The shooting likely lasted one or two minutes.\nI am unsettled today by [yet another mass shooting](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/16/us/indianapolis-fedex-shooting#the-attack-is-the-latest-in-a-recent-series-of-mass-shootings-in-the-us) in my country. It seems like not a day goes by without a _New York Times_ news alert about it. (I plan to turn those alerts off after I finish writing this.) This time, a gunman killed seven people, then himself. This detail about the story jumped out at me: “[The shooting likely lasted one or two minutes](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/16/us/indianapolis-fedex-shooting#shooting-at-a-fedex-warehouse-in-indianapolis-leaves-8-dead).”\n\nI think the news media covers mass shootings like they are exciting, like some kind of action movie where bad outcomes only happen to the extras, and the rest of us get to watch. But “one or two minutes” isn’t an action movie. It isn’t something exciting. It’s actually, really, really stupid. That such a thing is even possible, outside a war, is embarrassing and shameful to all of us. I wish it were more widely considered to be.\n\n\n# iPhone 13 mini could be the last 'mini' iPhone, says Kuo\nStephen Warwick reports in _iMore_: \n\n> Kuo says that next year Apple will drop the 5.4-inch model and run with two 6.1-inch models instead, one Pro, one regular.\n\nThis rumor is a prime reason I upgraded to the iPhone 12 mini early this year. I absolutely love the size and weight of it. It fits better in my hands and in my pockets than my iPhone 7 Plus ever did. However, the 12 mini’s small screen size makes it less compelling to read on, edit photos on, or watch videos on. These are all things I do pretty much every day without complaint, but if it were going to be my only portable device I would have bought one with a bigger screen.\n\nI have no desire to go back to a larger phone, because the phone, for me, is one tool among many, rather than the center of my computing universe. It doesn’t have to be compelling, just useful. It doesn’t have to be used constantly, just when it makes the most sense to. \n\nSome time from now, I think the smartphone, as a thing I carry around all the time, and as the default “Internet communication device,” is going to disappear and be replaced by something else: smart glasses maybe, or some kind of earpiece (when I am really old and need hearing aides).\n\n\n# My First NuGet Package\nLast night, I published my first [NuGet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/what-is-nuget) package: [TodoTxt.Library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TodoTxt.Library/1.0.0). It is a code library meant to help develop [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org) applications in [.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework). \n\nI wrote the code back in 2015, [open-sourced it on GitHub](https://github.com/mjdescy/TodoTxt.Library), but otherwise left it alone because I had moved on to more macOS and iOS development by that time. This week, I upgraded the code base work on .NET 5, so that it is cross platform (rather than Windows-only, as was my original version), and figured out how to package it and upload it to NuGet, where it may have a shot at actually being used.\n\n\n# Microsoft announces Surface Laptop 4 with choice of Intel or AMD processors\nTom Warren’s article on _The Verge_ caught my eye:\n\n> Microsoft is refreshing its Surface lineup with the Surface Laptop 4 today, which now offers the choice between AMD or Intel processors across both the 13.5- and 15-inch models. Both sizes will ship with Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors or AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series processors. Microsoft is shipping its Surface Laptop 4 on April 15th in the US, Canada, and Japan, starting at $999 for the AMD model and $1,299 for the Intel version — a $300 price gap between the pair.\n\nIf I was more of a Windows guy I would probably buy only Microsoft-brand laptops at this point. They don’t always have the best specs, but I like their designs a lot.\n\nI spend most of my computing time using Windows for work. I try to forget that I have a Lenovo laptop by putting it behind a giant monitor and using an external keyboard and trackball to operate it. Lenovo laptops are good, I guess, as long as I don’t have to touch them. I don’t like their keyboards (both in terms of layout and feel) or the pointing devices (the trackpad is too small, and I’m done with using the trackpoint/eraserhead thing). The Surface Laptops keyboards and trackpads have always seemed a lot more sensible to me in how they are designed.\n\n\n# Siri Reveals Apple Event Planned for Tuesday, April 20\nI’m assuming that somebody’s job, every day, is to wake up in the morning and ask Siri “[When is the next Apple Event](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/13/siri-apple-event-tuesday-april-20/)?” I’m glad I didn’t try to change careers back in 2009 or 2011 (when I thought of it) and get into tech journalism.\n\n\nI never would have predicted that in 2021 I would be using [a text-mode file manager from the 1990s](https://farmanager.com), a [command-line based to-do list program](https://github.com/VladimirMarkelov/ttdl), and, at least sometimes (by choice!), the [Vim](https://www.vim.org) text editor.\n\n\nTonight I published a huge update to the website for my first iOS app: [SwiftoDo](https://swiftodoapp.com). What was once a one page site with a very outdated template is now a Hugo-based site full of information. There is a lot more that I could add, it is now so much better than my old site I had to publish it.\n\n\n# James Hoffman’s AeroPress video\nLast year when I was looking for something soothing to watch on YouTube, I came across James Hoffmann’s many videos about coffee, coffee machines, coffee products, and so on. I have watched a ton of them, mostly because I like his voice and demeanor. [His latest video](https://youtu.be/aidvrssMSGo) is about the [AeroPress](https://aeropress.com), which I have used for many, many years. I actually learned something new from it: People use the funnel, which is meant to help put your coffee grounds into the press without making a mess, to brew coffee into cups with mouths too small for the bottom of the AeroPress. I have to try that! He also states in the video that the AeroPress is easy to make good coffee from, but is difficult to master. I actually put very little effort into my AeroPress use—far less than I used to when I first starting using it. I have found that my AeroPress brewing technique, no matter how sloppy or lazy, doesn’t seem to affect my coffee all that much. It prefer not stressing about it anymore.\n\n\n# Linux on the M1 Mac Mini\nThe Linux kernel is [gaining Apple M1 support](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/soc/soc.git/commit/?h=for-next&id=0d5fe4b31785b732b71e764b55cda5c8d6e3bbbf). I have been wondering if, years from now, I can move my M1 Mac Mini to a home app-server role, running Linux, when it gets too old for Xcode and stops getting macOS updates. I have a Celeron based PC doing that for me now, but it runs hot and can be noisy, too. If a machine can run Linux, it extends its lifespan considerably for me.\n\n\n# My (first) failed attempt to flash QMK on my mechanical keyboard\nI wasted an hour last night trying to install [QMK firmware](https://qmk.fm) on my work computer’s mechanical keyboard, a [Durgod Taurus K320](https://www.durgod.com/page9?product_id=47&_l=en). I have a love/hate relationship with it. I love that it has the best build quality, rigidity, stabilization, keycaps, and typing feel and sound of any of the many (many!) keyboards I have owned over the years. I hate that its software is buggy: so buggy that sometimes the keyboard hangs and I have to unplug it to fix it; so buggy that I have to plug it in directly to my laptop rather than through a USB hub; so buggy that that I cannot program its layers the way I want to.\n\nVery recently, someone figured out how to run QMK firmware on it, which could resolve the stability and customizability problems I have with the board. Unfortunately, I was not able to figure out how to flash the firmware to the keyboard. The main problem I faced was that the keyboard was not recognized by the QMK Toolkit software (on Windows) even after I put the keyboard into bootloader mode, and even after I started messing with the bootloader firmware using [Zadig](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/guides/driver_installation_zadig).\n\nAfter lots of tries, I couldn’t figure out. I think I dodged a bullet, though, because I’m not sure QMK can control the RGB backlighting, which, on this keyboard, is necessary to see the key legends. Fortunately, despite me trying to mess with it, my keyboard still works as well as it did before. It’s not perfect, and I really would like to create a more robust `Fn` (function key) layer, but I will live with it for now.\n\n\n🎵 I’m listening to [_Gaslighter_ by The Chicks](https://music.apple.com/us/album/for-her/1499733036?i=1499733045) again today. It is one of my favorite albums of 2020. Everything is great about it, from the catchy choruses to the close harmonies to the clean production. My favorite part of it is the songwriting, which is fueled with righteous anger and makes for compelling country-pop music.\n\n\nToday I made the mistake to look up someone I knew while I was in high school. I was reading an article about illegal drugs, and thought about a high school friend’s younger brother who ran into some drug problems about 20 years ago. Sadly, I discovered that he died last year. I can only conjecture, but it seems, based on what else happened to him over the past few years, that drug problems led to his premature death. Learning about what happened to him made me very sad.\n\n\n# Apple Arcade just got a huge update of new games, including some mobile classics\n[As reported by Andrew Webster in _The Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362388/apple-arcade-game-subscription-update-monument-valley-threes-iphone-ipad):\n\n> Apple’s gaming subscription service just got a massive influx of new titles. The headliner is Fantasian — the latest release from the creator of Final Fantasy — which is joined by other titles like new versions of NBA 2K and The Oregon Trail, and World of Demons from PlatinumGames. As part of the update, the service is getting two new categories of games: Apple calls them “Timeless Classics” and “App Store Greats.”\n\nI literally just canceled my (second) Apple Arcade free trial twelve hours before this announcement. I just can’t seem to get into Apple Arcade at all. For the most part, the reason is that I find my iPhone 12 mini to be too small to be a compelling gaming device. Secondarily, I don’t want to get into a complex, involved game on my iPhone or iPad. I prefer my mobile games to be simple things that can be jumped into and out of, more like the “Timeless Classics” that Apple is now adding to Apple Arcade. It’s too bad for Apple Arcade that I already own almost all of those games.\n\n\n# Fully vaccinated people may travel, CDC says\nAs reported by Lena H. Sun and Lori Aratani in _The Washington Post_:\n\n> Federal health officials gave the green light Friday for fully vaccinated people to resume travel as an estimated 100 million Americans have had at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine, and evidence mounts of the shots’ effectiveness.\n\nThat’s good news, but it doesn’t make me want to go out and travel by plane or train anytime soon.\n\nI am fully vaccinated, but my kids are not (because, of course, there is no approved vaccine for children yet), and that dramatically limits my desire to travel, eat in indoor restaurants, or do any indoor activities in public unless they are absolutely necessary. I understand that it is probably quite safe for me to do some of these activities (provided I wear a mask, etc.), but it seems to me that doing so would still be (even more) uncomfortable and unpleasant (than it was before). \n\nMy wife and I have been talking every day about what is OK or not OK for us to do now that we are vaccinated. Despite both being vaccinated, we are still not comfortable dining in restaurants or staying in hotels (don’t even talk about flying!), but we have realized that we are way behind our friends and acquaintances in terms of risk taking. We remain concerned about our children being explored to the virus, and about the rising and “extremely high” (per _The New York Times_) COVID-19 risk level our county is currently at. It just doesn’t make sense for us to change our behavior that much yet—at least not until the local COVID infection numbers go down quite a bit, which won’t happen until after a lot more people get vaccinated.\n\n\n⚾️ For the first time in over a year I have a baseball game on in the background as I work. I hope to get by the with MLB “free game of the day” offering this year, rather than paying to subscribe to the season package. There was no free game for the season opener yesterday, though, so I’m watching a spring training game.\n\n\n# OpenAI’s text-generating system GPT-3 is now spewing out 4.5 billion words a day\n[James Vincent reports in _The Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356180/openai-gpt-3-text-generation-words-day):\n\n> The best-known AI text-generator is OpenAI’s GPT-3, which the company recently announced is now being used in more than 300 different apps, by “tens of thousands” of developers, and producing 4.5 billion words per day. That’s a lot of robot verbiage. This may be an arbitrary milestone for OpenAI to celebrate, but it’s also a useful indicator of the growing scale, impact, and commercial potential of AI text generation.\n\nThe obvious industry target for auto-text is journalism. It is already being used there for sports reporting, and could probably be used for local government reporting too. There are other areas it will encroach on that are news-adjacent (think financial news or business book digest services like Blinkist), like education and entertainment.\n\nI’m an auditor, and I think that, eventually, auto-text is going to destroy about 50% of our billable hours. Auditors spend a *ton* of time writing. We document our procedures. We record our work. We summarize our findings. We write reports for our clients. Making sense of all the work, both for our own understanding and for our client’s, for the sake of writing it down, takes a lot of time. Moreover, the simple act of typing it out and, especially, hyperlinking everything together so we support our conclusions, requires a lot of manual work. Some of this work is communicative, but a lot of it (like the hyperlinking part) is mechanical. Consequently, much of it is ripe for automation.\n\nI think, though, that transforming this laborious and time-consuming writing process into something auto-generated by a bot would produce a lot more *information* but a lot less *knowledge* than we had before. You gain a lot more understanding how a company, business process, or control works by writing about it than by reading about it. Why? Because writing is *thinking*. To write well is mentally strenuous. It requires you to think how you would communicate an idea to someone else, notably someone else with a different perspective and different knowledge than you have. At the end of the writing process, you should understand your subject backwards and forwards and from all sides; you could probably describe it in a number of different ways; and you will likely remember the gist of it, and specific nuances about it, for far longer than you would if you had just read about it in a report.\n\nThe world won’t end, and few will shed tears, when AI writes audit reports and work papers. Audits cost money, and businesses mostly don’t think they benefit from them. If it makes the auditors less knowledgeable, however, side effects will develop, and those will be long-lasting. Knowledgable auditors help make good control environments possible, which leads to more stable and more solvent companies. Decreasing the understanding of auditors could make systems and processes more unstable and less trustworthy over time. Additionally, knowledgable auditors often move to the business side and go on to manage well-controlled organizations. While the auditor-to-manager career path will likely continue, such moves would not result in the same level of management quality if the auditors don’t have to think as deeply about what they are auditing as they did before the AI text-bots took over. Neither of these side effects bodes particularly well for the people the auditors and the audited companies (and their fancy AI) serve.\n\n\n# There is no perfect template—just pick one\nI stayed up late last night drafting a new, Hugo-driven version of one of my websites. I went from having nothing at all built to having about one third of the site done in a couple hours. The result, I think, will be more plain (and maybe more ugly) than the existing site, but it will be less janky on mobile devices.\n\nI sank a lot of time over the past week looking for a Hugo theme that is perfect for my needs, but I couldn’t find one. For the sake of achieving my simple goal of refreshing my tiny websites, I gave up the goal of visual perfection, and am driving forward with a theme that I think is OK that works well enough for me.\n\nFrom my perspective, I want my site to be easier to maintain and add content. That is more important to me than having a site that looks really slick. My old websites don’t look slick anymore, anyway: No one is fooled by outdated HTML templates into thinking that my very niche apps are developed by a huge, sophisticated software corporation.\n\n\n# The organizational rabbit hole\nThis is a short, short version of what happened to me over the past week when I decided to get organized.\n\n1. Form a desire to organize my project files differently.\n2. Discover the [Johnny Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com) system.\n3. Create a taxonomy for my files in a text file.\n4. Start writing PowerShell script to switch folders based on the Johnny Decimal number\n5. Start writing a PowerShell script to index all the Johnny Decimal numbers in my folder tree\n6. Think about working with files from the command line more often\n7. Install [Midnight Commander](https://midnight-commander.org) for a command line file manager\n8. Learn a lot of Midnight Commander shortcuts and customizations\n9. Learn about [Far Manager](https://farmanager.com), which is a lot like Midnight Commander but works much better on Windows\n10. Run into keyboard shortcut conflicts with Windows Terminal\n11. Learn about assigning and removing keyboard shortcuts in Windows Terminal\n12. Start thinking about using [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org) from the Windows Terminal, because my [TaskPaper](https://www.taskpaper.com) file has been too big for months and is awful to work with\n13. Tried to find a todo.txt command line app for Windows that works on my machine \n14. Thought about writing my own todo.txt command line app using an old C# library I created\n\nAnd...I still haven’t organized anything yet. 😅\n\n\n# The Falcon and the Winter Soldier 📺\nI watched episode one of [_The Falcon and the Winter Soldier_](https://www.marvel.com/tv-shows/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier/1) this week. It’s a show about two [MCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) characters I don’t particularly care that much about, so it wasn’t something I was really looking forward to, but I pay for Disney+ anyway and thought I may as well check it out. Reader, I liked it!\n\nMy first impression is that it looks like it cost a zillion dollars. Special-effects-wise, it looks on par with the Marvel movies. Based on that alone, I could see why Disney originally wanted it to premiere first, before _WandaVision_ and whatever other Marvel shows are being developed.\n\nMy second impression is that I appreciated that it was trying to tell a Black story as well as a super hero story. I am not optimistic that Sam’s (The Falcon’s) family side story is going to be anything but predictable, but it is nice to see an attempt to give the character some grounding in reality. Race is an issue that touches everything in American life, unfortunately. In some ways, it would be disrespectful to Sam’s character and to the audience not to address that in some way.\n\nI don’t have anything bad to say about the Winter Soldier part of the show, but it isn’t as interesting to me. I expect it to follow a predictable “antihero almost, but doesn’t quite, make good” formula, but maybe the writers will surprise me. \n\nPredictability aside, I’m just glad to have something new and fun to watch.\n\n\n# The menu key\nI was thinking about creating a training presentation to help my coworkers with keyboards shortcuts, but was dismayed to see that our Lenovo laptop keyboards (which I never use, because I work from home and use external peripherals) don’t even have a menu key. Someone decided that `Print Screen` was more important, which may even be true, but it doesn’t help me make a good presentation for my coworkers. The menu key alternative, `Shift+F10` is going to be a very hard sell, especially because `F10` on the laptop requires the `Fn` key to be pressed, too.\n\nI have gone from someone who did not use the [menu key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_key) on my keyboard for 20+ years (since it was invented in the 1990s) to someone who can’t live without it (on my Windows at least). I made it a point to start using it a few months ago, and now I use it constantly. I recommend that all Windows users with an ANSI or ISO keyboard layout check it out. That key is positioned right underneath your thumb when you use the arrow keys.\n\n\n🎵 “[Canada’s Country](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/canadas-country/pl.f2da318b2e1a4f358f10efc2021cba6e)”: I’ve been enjoying this laid-back playlist while I work. Honestly, I didn’t know Canada made country music. Unfortunately, there’s nothing particularly _Canadian_ about it. It would be cool if there were.\n\n\nPeople on LinkedIn still use a lot of #hashtags non-ironically. Who are they tagging content for?\n\n\n# Zach Snyder’s *Justice League*\nI was not I initially interested at all in the [Snyder Cut of _Justice League_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Snyder%27s_Justice_League) but I ended up watching it anyway, over two nights. I’m glad I did.\n\nI thought the theatrical release of _Justice League_ was pretty bad, but not quite as bad as the professional movie review consensus was. I figured that the Snyder cut must be better, but I was surprised at how much better it is. Granted, it still isn’t _good_. It doesn’t fix its pacing problems. It still is not as brisk and pleasurable as the best of the Marvel movies. It doesn’t tell a cohesive story, but it also crams in too many story lines for a non-DC fan to keep track of. It still has some dumb script problems, such every single part of the nonsensical museum height/terrorist bombing blot in the opening Wonder Woman scene, that could have been solved by editing a few sentences of dialog. While not exactly *good*, it is a good bad movie now. Its reach often exceeds its grasp, but it offers a lot of interesting material to people who are already fans. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to be the kind of movie that would bring a lot new fans in.\n\nIt is now very clear to me that Zach Snyder’s vision was dark and wild and weird—definitely too much of all of those things to launch a successful franchise—but Joss Whedon’s contributions were just awful: tasteless, asinine, nonsensical, and insulting to the audience. Whedon’s dialog (notably Superman’s and The Flash’s) and the character moments he created, like the race between The Flash and Superman, are embarrassing to watch and make the characters seem stupid. Snyder’s cut simply had better dialog for them. Simply getting rid of the random _people_ that Whedon put into that nuclear wasteland Russian city—the one that existed in the movie only to be destroyed in a bout of cinematic excess—made the climax bearable. Who needs to worry about a family who shouldn’t be living in a nuclear wasteland anyway when the entire world is already at stake? Whedon really did screw up that movie. \n\nI think that the Snyder Cut works very well for fans of the comics, especially fans of the “what-if” versions of all the famous characters. Some fans, like me, believe that comic book characters are archetypes, and really can be _anything_, and no representation of them is truly canonical. The grim, dark version of the Justice League is an interesting thought experiment, one of many worth exploring. It is not something I ever felt hung up on as “not the real version” of Superman or whatever. The Snyder Cut isn’t the real version of the DC Universe to me, because nothing is. It’s all just ideas and entertainment anyway.\n\n\n# Alt+F4\nI have been using [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com) for many years, and I never thought until today to map `Windows+Q` to quit the active app and close the active window. That creates something very similar to Mac’s `Command+Q` shortcut to Windows.\n\nThe default Windows keyboard shortcut for quitting an app is `Alt+F4`, which is a two hand operation for me. Note that in AutoHotKey, you don’t even need to send that key command; you can use the WinClose function instead:\n\n#q::\nWinClose, A\nReturn\n\nOne of the best things Apple has ever done with their support of keyboard shortcuts was to pretend that function keys (`F1` through `F12`) don’t exist.\n\n\n# Intel invests $20 billion into new factories, will produce chips for other companies\n[Chiam Gartenberg reports in *The Verge*](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing):\n\n> At the company’s “Engineering the Future” announcement today, Gelsinger announced plans to outsource more of Intel’s chip production to third-party foundries; a $20 billion investment into two new fabs in Arizona; and a new branch of the company called Intel Foundry Services, which will see Intel’s foundries produce chips for other companies.\n\nIntel has had an awful decade, having missed out on smartphone chips and having stalled out at their 14nm process for years. Still, it is a strategically important company for my country, and I have to ill will toward it, even if I don’t prefer their products right now. I would love to see them become competitive again.\n\nThe idea of Intel fabbing chips for other companies is a big deal. Intel has never done that before. It seems to me like it could be the first step of spinning off that part of the business into its own company, and focusing on process shrinks in ways that the fully integrated Intel could not before.\n\n\n# Seven mass shootings in seven days\nJosh Berlinger of _CNN_ reports today that [the Colorado attack is the 7th mass shooting in 7 days in the US](http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_d3f4ea80ea0d81acb5d30fcf939c3243). \n\nIt seemed like there were periods in recent years in which we had a deadly mass shooting in the national news at least every week, if not several times each week. There has been something of a pause due to COVID, for understandable reasons. Unfortunately, we seem to be un-pausing now. Sadly, mass shooting rates in the U.S. seem to be getting back to normal. \n\nBut what is “normal?” It is actually hard to know what is normal for gun violence in the U.S. Here’s an interesting factoid from the article about my country’s gun problem:\n\n> It's unclear how this number of mass shootings compares to an average week in the US.\n> \n> Though some official gun violence data is available, the US federal government does not have a centralized system or database to track firearm incidents and mass shootings nationwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks some gun violence data, nearly 40,000 people were killed in incidents involving firearms in 2019.\n\nThe article omits the reason for this: There are actually [laws against government agencies, such as the CDC, accurately tracking gun violence](https://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-government-study-gun-violence/story?id=50300379). That’s just stupid and self-defeating. While dying due to gun violence is incredibly unlikely, statistically speaking, it is also completely unnecessary. We should treat [all gun deaths](https://usafacts.org/data/topics/security-safety/crime-and-justice/firearms/firearm-deaths/) as *preventable* and *unacceptable*. Only then can we have the mental and moral clarity to do something about it.\n\n\n# Ulysses and Micro.blog\nIt is amazing that [Ulysses supports posting to Micro.blog now](https://blog.ulysses.app/ulysses-22/). I love the functionality, and its inclusion definitely cements Ulysses as my only writing app on iOS and macOS at this point.\n\nNow let’s bug the Ulysses team to do some other cool things:\n\n1. Implement publishing workflows, by which publishing a sheet can automatically trigger the sheet to be tagged with a keyword, be moved to a particular folder (such as “published”), or call an iOS Shortcut.\n2. Make every command accessible via a hardware keyboard shortcut. (I’m thinking mainly of the iPad version.)\n3. Add a command palette, like Visual Studio Code and Sublime Text have.\n4. Support [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/), a text-based markup language for creating flowcharts, in fenced code blocks, like [Typora](https://typora.io) does. \n\n\n# CDC Says Schools Can Now Space Students 3 Feet Apart, Rather Than 6\n[As Anya Kamenetz, Cory Turner, and Allison Aubrey report on the _NPR_ website today](https://text.npr.org/978608714):\n\n> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its guidance for schools. On Friday, the agency announced it \"now recommends that, with universal masking, students should maintain a distance of at least 3 feet in classroom settings.\"\n> \n> Previously the guidance stated, \"Physical distancing (at least 6 feet) should be maximized to the greatest extent possible.\" The new guidelines still call for 6 feet of distance between adults and students as well as in common areas, such as auditoriums, and when masks are off, such as while eating. And the 6-foot distancing rule still applies for the general public in settings such as grocery stores.\n\nThis news is causing a good deal of consternation in my family. COVID cases are going up in our local schools right now. There has been an extremely high risk level in the community for several weeks, and in-person instruction is expanding anyway. Our school systems have been flatly stating that they will open even though they cannot conform with some of the requirements. This change in CDC requirements makes it easier for them to comply.\n\nI think the changing of, and complexity in, the distancing rules makes them seem suspect and less likely to be followed at all. This concern is counterbalanced, however, by my belief that distancing helps very little in the classroom, because every classroom I have seen has poor ventilation. My wife and I are keeping our kids remote until the end of the school year. We are still hopeful enough to consider September as the right time to send them back to in-person learning.\n\n\n🎵 I’m currently listening to [_Chemtrails over the Country Club_](https://music.apple.com/us/album/chemtrails-over-the-country-club/1545567745) by Lana Del Ray for the first time. I have been waiting for this one. Lana Del Ray is one of my favorite artists. It’s too soon for me to tell how much I like it.\n\n\n# Friday is time for Inbox Zero\nI have been an [Inbox Zero](http://www.43folders.com/43-folders-series-inbox-zero) guy since the early 2000s. Now I can’t keep up with my email; it comes in too fast, and I actually have work to do that demands my attention. Consequently, my Inbox is almost never empty. \n\nNow, mostly on Fridays, I just select all my Inbox emails (`Ctrl-A`) and move them to my Archive folder (`Ctrl-Shift-1` thanks to an [Outlook Quick Step](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/automate-common-or-repetitive-tasks-with-quick-steps-b184f89f-3738-4562-96de-c0244ea830f2) I created), whether I have processed them or not. The emails aren’t deleted, they are just out of my Inbox, and that’s good enough.\n\n\nI am investing some time trying to see if I could implement a [Johnny Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com) system for my files at work. Some of the constraints are tricky to deal with, but the general idea of it dovetails into what I have been doing for organization, and takes it one or two steps further.\n\n\n# Apple's new iPad Pro leaks ahead of rumored event\n[Corinne Reichert and Stephen Shankland report in _CNET_](https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-new-ipad-pro-leaks-ahead-of-rumored-event/): \n\n> Apple will launch a series of new iPads in April, a report Wednesday said. The new iPad Pros will come with Apple's homemade M1 chips, a Thunderbolt port, and better cameras and screens, according to Bloomberg. They will reportedly come in 11- and 12.9-inch display sizes.\n\nThat’s cool. Maybe I’m not a “Pro” but the iPad Air 4 is just about perfect for me. From my layman’s perspective, the A14-based chip in the iPad Air 4 is very similar to the M1, minus some of the cores. The 2020 iPad Pro’s chip (an A12Z) is a generation or two behind that, though it has more cores than the A14 does. Apple obviously needs to remedy that to help justify the iPad Pro’s greater price. \n\nI am thinking that the “Thunderbolt” port is merely following the direction that everything with a USB-C connector is going in: USB 4 compatibility. That, plus more processor cores, sounds good for videographers, podcasters, photographers, and (I guess) gamers. Unfortunately, if Apple doesn’t fix some problems with the Files app (just try transferring a gigabyte-sized file off your iPad to a network share—I’ll wait...for it to fail), these performance boosts will be hamstrung.\n\n\n# Effective Presentations\nWhen it comes to creating effective PowerPoint presentations for work, my reach still exceeds my grasp.\n\nI know a lot of important concepts, including the following:\n\n1. The slide deck is a visual aid, _not_ the presentation\n2. Focus on one idea per slide\n3. Focus on very few visual elements/focus points per slide (e.g., five or six, maximum)\n4. Light text on a dark background is easier on the eye\n\nUnfortunately, when I try to apply those ideas, I feel like I’m not getting anywhere. All of my slides look completely conventional: no better than those I created many years ago. I think they are effective, but they are ugly and boring. It does not help that I have to present on topics that are dry and technical in nature. I also feel hamstrung by my company’s PowerPoint template, which is quite busy, focuses attention on the wrong areas of the slide (i.e., the title and the footer), and has (almost completely) black text on a white background.\n\nI think I need to invent a visual style that I can get away with on at least some of my slides:\n\n- Full-bleed images that cover the entire slide, and obviate the need for titles or footers on my slides.\n- Text boxes that float over the images, or captions that fill in the top title area that is already part of our PowerPoint template.\n\nI just hope, if I do these things, my slides won’t end up looking like tired internet memes.\n\n\n# Team-building call with Lindsi Swartz 2021-03-09\nBackground:\n\nHealth administration\n\nBusiness school\n\nFilling out testing worksheets.\n\nLooking up procedure codes on findacode.com.\n\n\n🎵 The Hold Steady’s latest album, [Open Door Policy](https://music.apple.com/us/album/open-door-policy/1539020630), is growing on me. I know reviewers love it, because it is a return to form, but I was hoping for something different. It’s hard to say, what, though. Something that’s a mix of fun and depressing, like my favorite Hold Steady lyrics, I guess. \n\n\n🎵 I loved all of the “Playlists from Visionary Women” that were front-and-center on Apple Music for International Women’s Day today.

It says that it will continue to produce and focus on the HomePod mini, introduced last year.\n\nI, like many audiophiles, passed on the original HomePod due to its high price and lack of connectivity. I’m sure I would have enjoyed how it sounded, and its size is just right for me, but I would likely have had to buy two of them to be fully satisfied (stereo separation is important to me). At $349 each, that was too expensive.\n\nThe smaller, cheaper HomePod mini holds little appeal to me, and seems to be a far less interesting product for the audio engineers at Apple to work on. For all I know, though, it sells in huge numbers, which makes it interesting in and of itself. Maybe a HomePod mini max (ha!) will be released someday, at around $150, which will hit the price/performance sweet spot I am looking for.\n\n\n# The COVID-versary\nI guess, based on the occurrence of a President Biden speech, that this week marks [the one-year anniversary of COVID-19 in the United States](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/Voices/2021/03/12/Joe-Biden-COVID-19-anniversary-speech-full-text/8161615555448/). To me, the baleful presence of COVID-19 has been around for what feels like much, much longer—[so long that I can’t even remember it clearly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic).\n\nMy COVID panic started in early [January](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_January_2020), when we thought the disease was only in Wuhan. In America, for a couple weeks at least, it still seemed likely that the disease would never leave China, much like H1N1 and SARS never made a big impact here. For almost three months my mental state caromed between what I think of now as irrational fear and rational fear. I could see the whole year of 2020 play out in my imagination, way before my friends and family could see what was coming, but I could do nothing to stop it, and I could do almost nothing to protect my family from it. All those feelings felt very real and very debilitating, even when almost no one else around me was feeling them.\n\nI had about two months of angst about COVID before it actually hit around here. The last time I went out with friends and family was, I think, on March 14, 2020. We went to see a musical and when out to eat at a crowded restaurant afterward. It was really hard for me to feel comfortable the entire time, but I didn’t want to let everybody down because I was concerned about a pandemic that hadn’t hit our area yet. Less than a week later, my entire family was on lockdown.\n\nBack in January, February, and early March 2020, it didn’t help me at all to have known about the scope and length and shape of prior pandemics, like the [Spanish Flu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu), which I know, from reading family letters, killed a bunch of people in my extended family about a hundred years ago. It didn’t help me at all to know what I should do and buy to prepare for it. It didn’t help me at all that I am smart enough to think for myself and to scrutinize, with a pretty good understanding of the relevant science and statistics, the information and advice experts were providing to us. All of these things just made me feel more uncertain and more cynical about what was going on.\n\nA year later, I am feeling more hopeful. I have the vaccine after all, and am probably (but not definitely) immune to COVID 18. But my [county is still at extremely high risk level](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/monmouth-new-jersey-covid-cases.html). The numbers are still higher than they were last year when all of us were in a panic. Despite that, all the states, even blue states like mine, are reopening rapidly and throwing caution to the wind, when it would be more prudent to do so more gradually. It makes me nervous that we are giving the virus a chance to circulate long enough to adapt resistance to our vaccines.\n\nI was early in being scared of COVID, and I may be late in getting over that fear. I just hope that, when I look forward from today, whatever fear I feel is merely anxiety over things that will not play out, rather than the accurate foresight into the future that I had late last winter.\n\n\nThere was [a brush fire yesterday not too far from where I live](https://www.nj.com/news/2021/03/large-lakewood-brush-fire-closes-portion-of-gsp.html). Brush fires are incredibly rare where I live, so this is a curiosity to me. We have had dry, windy weather for about two weeks now, which makes wildfire conditions rife. My family was outside yesterday but fortunately we didn’t notice it; we must have been upwind.\n\n\nI’m probably being a climate-change alarmist right now, but I think we have never had such frequent windstorms in New Jersey as we have had this winter.\n\n\nI am grateful that the weather has changed from snowy and blustery to warm and calm. I have been able to take a walk after my lunch break for two days in a row. It feels nice.\n\n\n# 'This Is The Reality Of Black Girls': Inauguration Poet Says She Was Tailed By Guard\n[Matthew S. Schwartz reports for NPR](https://text.npr.org/974362036):\n\n> To millions of people around the world, the young poet Amanda Gorman represents hope, change and the promise of a better America.\n> \n> But to a security guard on Friday night, the young African American woman represented a potential threat to public safety.\n\nThis is a sad story. My first thought was that Amanda Gorman could legitimately have been harmed in a situation like this. Then I thought, she should have a bodyguard or an entourage with her at all times for protection. _Then_ I thought, she should not need to! That could ruin her life.\n\nAmanda Gorman is a strong and bold speaker, and deserves the last word on the matter:\n\n> \"In a sense, he was right,\" the former National Youth Poet Laureate added. \"I AM A THREAT: a threat to injustice, to inequality, to ignorance. Anyone who speaks the truth and walks with hope is an obvious and fatal danger to the powers that be.\"\n\n\n# Mermaid 🧜‍♀️ for flowcharts\nTonight I learned about [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/), which is a plaintext markup language and renderer for creating flowcharts and other kinds of diagrams.\n\nI want to make flowcharts quickly for my technical projects at work, but i don’t have Visio, and I hate fiddling with a GUI to line up shapes and worry about arrow lengths and so on. The way my mind works, I just want to type out what I want and have software figure out how to lay it out for me. I don’t care that much how it looks, as long as it is simple and makes sense. \n\nMermaid’s plaintext premise is really cool, and the syntax is flexible enough to not be awful. It is way more flexible than the examples on The Mermaid website originally led me to believe.

That, indeed, is the life of an auditor.\n\n\n# Gen: Lock\nI watched “[Gen:lock](https://roosterteeth.com/series/gen-lock)” over the past week. I was disappointed that it introduced a premise-breaking plot development in the penultimate episode. My beef is 100% spoiler-y.\n\nThe shows is a [mecha anime](https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/tags/mecha). Its premise is that, in some future war in which big robots piloted by people fight each other, a new type of mech is developed that is remotely controlled by very rare, very special kind of person. That person must bind her mind to the mech through a lot of hand-wavey technology called gen:lock.\n\nThe problem is, we learn three things in the final two episodes of season 1 that make the pilots unnecessary:\n\n1. A person’s mind can uploaded to, and downloaded from, a digital brain\n2. A digital brain can be copied an indefinite number of times.\n3. A digital brain is all that is needed to drive a mech\n\nIf one pilot’s mind can be copied, without harming her, and then bound to any number of mechs, then why do we need the pilots at all, once you’ve got the first one’s mind copied? If the pilots aren’t really necessary, why haven’t the characters in charge of the gen:lock program figured that out yet?\n\nI’m not sure I will pick it up again when season 2 comes out. Maybe this kind of anime isn’t for me.\n\n\n# Neera Tanden is Biden’s first Cabinet-level nominee to withdraw\n[Ella Nilson at vox.com reports](https://www.vox.com/2021/3/2/22310271/neera-tanden-biden-omb-withdraws):\n\n> But much of Tanden’s résumé was overshadowed by her proliferous online posting — at least 1,000 tweets raking both Republicans and leftist Democrats over the coals — that Tanden quietly started deleting in November 2020.\n\nI haven’t been following this story, but my interest was piqued when I learned that Neera Tanden’s nomination chances were in jeopardy because of her tweets from the past. People keep getting in trouble for what they post to Twitter. (“Social media” in these cases always is Twitter, too. That is probably just because it is public facing, though it is also a popular place for broadcasting, calling out, and grandstanding.)\n\nIt will soon be the conventional wisdom that those who seek high offices—in public service or in private industry—should have no public social media presence, no blog—certainly no Twitter account—maybe no public online presence at all. That bothers me because I think there is value in publishing one’s thoughts to the world, in a blog, vlog, podcast, or whatever other medium I can't even conceive of yet. People have an urge to share and should not feel that they will be punished for it, especially years after they tap the “post” button. \n\nI understand that some people are deliberately awful on social media, and that _is_ a problem, but isn't it also a problem that “the Internet never forgets?” [The right to be forgotten](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten) is at both ridiculous to ask for and essential for people to get along with each other after a certain point. How should we evaluate a person based on what she posted online? Does it matter how long ago a thought was posted? What is fair? I think we are at a cultural crossroads regarding these questions, and may be stuck at that crossroads for a long, long time.\n\n\n# Trust\nTrust relies on three things:\n\n1. Competence—can you do something well?\n2. Benevolence—are you doing good?\n3. Integrity—will you do the right thing, even when things are bad for you?\n\nI heard this breakdown on a podcast episode earlier this week, and loved the idea so much that I hastily dictated a note to Siri about it (I was in my car at the time), but I can’t recall which podcast I heard it on or who said it. I found an analogous summary of the idea on the Wiley Online Library site, in an abstract about a chapter of the book _[Handbook of Principles of Organizational Behavior: Indispensable Knowledge for Evidence‐Based Management, Second Edition](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119206422.ch21)_:\n\n> This chapter focuses on using the concepts of ability, benevolence, and integrity as a means of increasing trust. Ability, benevolence, and integrity are the most critical facets of trustworthiness. They foster a sense of trust in the leader by followers. Ability reflects the knowledge, skills, and aptitudes of a leader, in both technical areas and general management competencies. Benevolence and integrity are aspects of the leader's character, and require more time and attention on the part of followers before they can be reliably judged. In order to increase trust, leaders need to take steps to increase their ability, build their benevolence, and demonstrate their integrity. Leaders can do so on a follower‐by‐follower basis, but can also take steps to create a culture of trustworthiness within their organizations.\n\nBreaking down concepts like “trust”—which seem innately understood and obvious—into component parts can be very powerful. It gives you a way “in” when it comes to solving problems dependent on that concept.\n\n\n# Boston Red Sox's Dustin Pedroia announces retirement from MLB\n[Joon Lee of ESPN reports](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/30816259/boston-red-sox-dustin-pedroia-announces-retirement-mlb'):\n\n> Boston Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia, who hasn't played since 2019 because of a knee injury suffered two seasons earlier, announced his retirement Monday.\n> \n> \"Could it have ended better and I finished my career the right way? Yeah of course,\" Pedroia said on a Zoom call with the media. \"But there was a reason I was the first one dressed at 5:30 for a 7 o'clock game. I always tell my teammates that you never know if the game is going to start early. My biggest thing in my mind was that this could be my last game and you don't know. That's the best way I approached it from Little League on. I had the best time playing.\"\n\nAs a Red Sox fan, Pedroia’s retirement is no surprise. He hasn’t been physically able to play for years, since he got injured by a Manny Machado slide at second base. It is sad nonetheless. In his prime, he was fun and exciting to watch, and embodied the quality I enjoy seeing the most as a fan: “the love of the game.”\n\n\n# NYU researchers find no evidence of anti-conservative bias on social media\n[Kim Lyons reports in _The Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260269/anti-conservative-bias-social-media-no-evidence-nyu-research):\n\n> “The contention that social media as an industry censors conservatives is now, as we speak, becoming part of an even broader disinformation campaign from the right, that conservatives are being silenced all across American society,” the report’s lead researcher Paul Barrett said in an interview with The Verge. “This is the obvious post-Trump theme, we’re seeing it on Fox News, hearing it from Trump lieutenants, and I think it will continue indefinitely. Rather than any of this going away with Trump leaving Washington, it’s only getting more intense.”\n\nThis is one of those studies that *may* help future historians sort through the mess we are living through now. It is pretty obvious to me that there is a conservative bias on social media rather than a liberal one. The shocking election in 2016 of a mendacious “conservative” social media gasbag is enough proof. That he wasn’t deplatformed until he lost the 2020 election, despite sowing devision and inciting violence on social media platforms, is further proof of it.\n\nI bristle now at hearing or seeing the word “conservative” describe the people running a disinformation campaign against their fellow citizens. There’s nothing “conservative” about this influential and dangerous wing of the Republican Party, which is undermining the basic traditions and institutions of society. I identify strongly as a political progressive, but I am also quite conservative in how I think that people should behave publicly and how ethically and transparently political institutions should be run.\n\n\n# Fullmetal Alchemist\nWhile I have been working a ton lately, I can’t work every second of the day. I have been watching the “Fullmetal Alchemist” anime series (there are two), mostly late at night, to unwind.\n\nI watched the entirety of “Fullmetal Alchemist”—which is the first anime adaptation of the manga—first. Because it veers widely off of the plot of the manga (which, since I am not a manga reader, I don’t care about), it seems to be widely considered the lesser of the two adaptations. I think that sells it short. There are lots of sad, thought-provoking episodes, especially toward the beginning of the run, in which characters and the audience question what it means to be human, and what is the value of a human soul. These questions build up to big ideas and set pieces by the end, which is satisfying. There are some structural problems with how the story is told—mostly in the way the timeline, pacing, and character balance shift between the beginning, middle, and end of the series—but there is no problem that majorly detracts from the series as a whole. You could quibble that a lot of the theory behind how the magic system works doesn’t make any sense, which is vital to the overall theme of the series. Consider, however, that it is a _magic system_, you have to suspend disbelief quite a bit to begin with, and of course it doesn’t make perfect sense.\n\nI am almost done watching the second adaptation, “Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood”, which stays true to the manga plot and is generally lauded as the better of the two anime series. At this point, I don’t think of it as “better” but it certainly is much different. The stakes in “Brotherhood” are much higher, the characters are more tightly integrated throughout the series, and the tone overall is funnier and less sad, despite the raised stakes and some (somewhat) more mature relationship elements between childhood friends/teenage-phenoms Edward and Winry. Despite these advantages, “Brotherhood” is far more cartoony in style, which I don’t prefer. It uses _chibi_ (super deformed) style far more heavily than the first adaptation did, which I find distracting—the characters are often blowing their stacks in anger or are extremely embarrassed or go into some of other extreme, but emotionally and visually, that takes me out of the story a bit. That is a relatively small demerit, however, and it is offset by the increased complexity of the story.\n\nI am eager to see how “Brotherhood” ends, and would recommend that everyone try watching both series, especially the first one, because it is very good despite being the less-loved one.\n\n\n# Little Voice\nMy wife and I recently discovered the Apple TV+ show “[Little Voice](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/little-voice/umc.cmc.4x932osv992wjjdq7ce12za2r)” and very much enjoy it.\n\nIt is different in pace and tone from other shows (like “Curb Your Enthusiasm”) that we have been watching lately. While there is a lot going on in each episode, the pace feels slow and thoughtful, as if the show is focused mainly on the growth of its characters and on illustrating (a version of) the New York City music scene. I would not recommend watching “Little Voice” for its main plot, because it appears to follow the well-worn path of “talented-but-unknown artist slowly becomes successful.” That said, there are a ton of great character moments throughout.\n\nThe main draw of the show is the music, most of which are songs written by series co-creator Sara Bareilles. There is a lot of music performance in each episode. All these sections look great, sound great, and are integrated completely naturally into the story. However, they serve as the primary reason why the pace is slow. If you don’t like the music, then the show will not be for you. \n\nOverall, I think that “Little Voice” is under-rated. It didn’t blow up like “Ted Lasso” (which is, indeed, great) or “Central Park” (which is also great), but is my third-favorite Apple TV+ series thus far.\n\n\nI have been super, super, super busy today, and it just won’t stop. It looks like I’ll be working a lot of overtime...like right now. At least, once the kids go to bed, I can put my headphones back on and enjoy some music while I work.\n\n\n# The Business of Influenece with MKBHD\nI found this [fairly long interview on _The Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/22231657/mkbhd-marques-brownlee-interview-youtube-creator-influencer-decoder) with Marques Brownlee ([MKBHD on YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/mkbhd)) to be very interesting:\n\n> But what looks effortless and fun to the viewer is often the result of careful planning and investment. YouTubers are entrepreneurs, and Brownlee — my guest on today’s episode of Decoder — talks that talk with the best of them.\n\nMarques Brownlee could be described as “tech reviewer” or a “social media influencer” or a “YouTuber.” I don’t watch all his videos, but I have checked in with his YouTube channel periodically since I first saw him (as a college student!) on an episode of TWiT. While he is telegenic and charismatic, he also presents himself as someone with a strong sense of ethics who is very smart and thoughtful about he approaches his business. This interview gives a pretty long look into Marques Brownlee’s professional world.\n\nMy wife, who is a high school teacher, recently reported to me that one of the top “professions” that teens want to go into is “social media influencer.” That is kind of eyeroll-inducing to me, but I suppose it is as realistic and as meaningful an aspiration as “famous writer” was to me. It is important to know how much work goes into that sort of job, and how much time, investment, and infrastructure goes into keeping up with the competition.\n\n\nI don’t really want to criticize [TapBots for making TweetBot version 6 a subscription app](https://www.macstories.net/news/tweetbot-6-moves-to-subscription-pricing/).

Let’s Quickly Get Them into People’s Arms.\n[Jason Kottke’s blog post](https://kottke.org/21/01/the-covid-19-vaccines-are-amazing-lets-quickly-get-them-into-peoples-arms) offers some great advice that we all should heed:\n\n> So what can you do about this right now? 1. Stop worrying about the variants until the experts let us know we have something to worry about. 2. If you are eligible for the vaccine, get it! 3. Spread the word about vaccine availability in your area. Yesterday Vermont opened signups for vaccination appointments for all Vermonters 75 and older, and I texted/emailed everyone I could think of who was over 75 or who had parents/relatives/friends who are over 75 to urge them to sign up or spread the word. 4. Continue to wear a mask (a better one if possible), wash your hands, social distance, stay home when possible, don’t spend time indoors w/ strangers, etc. Thanks to these remarkable vaccines, real relief is in sight — let’s keep on track and see this thing through.\n\nMy family is now obsessed with wearing two layers of masks, which I tried but couldn’t get to work with my glasses on. I am more interested in finally being able to buy and wear N95, KN95, and KN94 (my favorite) masks, which are more effective than the cloth masks and surgical masks I have been stuck with since February.\n\nIn New Jersey, vaccine distribution is both successful (my wife, who is a teacher, got her first dose yesterday) and a total mess (it is very hard to get an appointment, there is no central coordination of virus distribution, and any effective effort on prioritizing inoculations for higher-risk groups is effective gone). If my family is a good indicator of people’s behavior, then lots of us New Jerseyans keep hammering away at the appointment systems, trying to get a better appointment slot, which further jams up the system.\n\n\nI wrote a support email to [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app) last week inquiring about [micro.blog](https://micro.blog) support.

During the same period last year, the agency reported 1,016 cases.\n\nI get a vaccine every year for the flu—and luckily have not caught it since I was in elementary school—but other than that, I never think about it. My dream right now is that the COVID vaccine be the same kind of thing: a prick on the arm once a year, and otherwise nothing much to think about.\n\n\n🎵 I’m trying out [PlexAmp](https://plexamp.com) again, and am listening to Herbie Hancock’s “Gershwin’s World” (in [ALAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lossless)) which has been in my library for over twenty years and probably hasn’t been listened to since 2000.\n\n\nI made the mistake today of turning off my home media server (HP N54L) for a few minutes to see how quiet my office is without its fan running.

So the last time I was in a room with a lot of people was the table read episodes one and two of season three, and we were ready to go. Then it all got shut down. Season three is completely written, ready to go, and then during this time we actually went and wrote season four. So we have both of those kinda done. We’re just waiting until we can start shooting again.”\n\n“Barry” is a _ sui generis_ example of peak TV. It takes a lot of risks in terms of both plot and tone, and so far they have all paid off. I certainly couldn’t predict how Bill Hader and Alex Berg were going to write their way out of the end of Season 2 of “Barry,” but I guess they cracked it and then some.\n\n\n[Music for Programming](http://musicforprogramming.net/#) is definitely not for me, but I *love* the all-text site design.\n\n\n# Why did I get a webcam again? 😂\nI just got a Logitech C920 webcam to use for video calls at work.

I pushed the news of it away as best I could, so I am less informed than I otherwise would be, but I am sad, angry, and ashamed nonetheless.\n\n[Per Philip Rucker in _The Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-rioters-incite/2021/01/06/0acfc778-5035-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html):\n\n> The “American carnage” that Donald Trump vowed to end at the dawn of his presidency was revived in terrifying, treacherous form at its sunset Wednesday, as Trump made a fiery last stand and incited his supporters to storm and sack the U.S. Capitol as part of an attempted coup.\n\nI don’t even know how to comment on this event without seeming glib, but I feel compelled to say something anyway.\n\nI am, by trade, an auditor. One thing auditors are trained to investigate is called “tone at the top,” which represents the values expressed by the top management of a company which are expected from everyone who reports up to them. \n\nAfter auditing for years, I have discovered that “tone at the top” is almost everything you need to know about an organization to get an idea how well and how ethically it is operated. Ethics and decency from the top of an organization really do trickle down all the way to the bottom and permeate it entirely. Moreover, they are strongly indicative of the organization’s *solvency*—its ability to hold together as a going concern over time.\n\nWhen the “tone at the top” is selfish, vain, petty, petulant, aggrieved, unethical, amoral, and violent—as Trump’s has been—that tone trickles down to the whole organization, and pollutes the thoughts and corrupts the actions of the people within it. Unfortunately in this case, the “organization” is not just the Executive Branch, not just the federal government, and not just the Republican Party: it is the entire United States of America. What’s more, because the U.S. is a vastly influential country, the corruption and willful deceit at the head of it spills over into the rest of the world.\n\nI feel like I have known this from the beginning—before the slow-moving coup even started—because I understood what the “tone at the top” was, and knew that it was vitally important. _Knowing_ this, sadly, is not enough, because in a democracy a majority of people need to know this for things to turn out better. Being _able_ to know this, like being able to discern the “tone at the top” as a new auditor, is a rare gift. It requires a trait that is not easily acquired, but is so difficult to teach and to learn that it is often considered to be innate: _shrewdness_. \n\nThat’s because “tone at the top” isn’t always as blatantly obvious as Trump’s vitriolic tweets and shambolic rally speeches. Understanding what the “tone at the top” _really_ is, it requires a combination of healthy skepticism, decent powers of observation, and the knowledge of how things are supposed to work. You have to understand both context *and* subtext; subtext is much harder to grasp than context, but is often the more important to the two. You have to interpret people’s words *and* actions, and compare them to each other to see if the actions follow the words. You also have to have some kind of ethical foundation—which may be laws of the state, societal norms, or virtue ethics— on which to base your conclusions. \n\nThe human mind has evolved to do a lot of this analysis automatically. Consider that establishing whether you trust another person is, and always has been, an essential part of human interaction. But, like a lot of thought processes that are largely automatic, many times mental shortcuts are taken and the wrong choice is made. To be able to second-guess these automatic thought processes takes intellect, some degree of guidance, and a willingness to think a little harder.\n\nI would not be surprised to learn that many of the people trying to unlawfully overturn the election—not counting the elected officials who are operating out of cynical self-interest—really do think they are making an ethical decision, and really do think they are doing the right thing. They just trusted the wrong person, or made the wrong decision about voting for or supporting, because they lack the shrewdness and imagination to discern that the “tone at the top” really does matter, and that bad words from a lazy president really will lead to riots in the streets.\n\n\nI realized today that in, ACL, a scripting language I use at work, I have been using a mixture of `PascalCase` and `snake_case` (like this: `Table_Name`) that is the worst of both worlds in terms of typing difficulty. Fortunately, ACL is not case-sensitive.\n\n\n# Zero\nI am a big fan of [the Zero app](https://medium.com/[@kevinrose](https://micro.blog/kevinrose)/introducing-zero-a-new-app-to-help-you-fast-209935e8245d), which is a tracker for intermittent fasting. It is free, attractive, and has just enough features to keep me engaged and motivated, and no more. \n\nCurrently, my favorite feature is its Apple Watch complication, which fills up a ring (similar to the Activity app’s rings) as you progress through your fasting period. I find that filling that ring every day, and the app's cheerful notifications every morning, really help motivate me to stop snacking or having an extra meal at night.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about it is that it requires you to set up an account with an email address. While the company behind it does not appear to be abusing my privacy in any way, I would prefer that they didn’t require an account. Perhaps they will adopt Sign in with Apple when it becomes available this fall.\n\nIf you are interested in Zero, [download it from the iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zero-fasting-tracker/id1168348542?mt=8).\n\n\n# Thoughts on Apple Card\nI got the Apple Card about a week ago, and just started using it this weekend. Here are some initial thoughts:\n\n1. I very much like the security and privacy features Apple Pay and the Apple Card. I try to use Apple Pay whenever I can to take advantage of most of these features, no matter what card I was using.\n2. I very much like the enhancements to the Wallet app on my iPhone to review transactions and spending.\n3. 2% cash back on all Apple Pay purchases seems like a pretty good benefit to me.\n4. 3% back on Apple transactions seems a little stingy, considering that Amazon and Target offer 5% back when you use their branded cards. I would get a much better cash-back rate buying an Apple product on Amazon, using my Amazon.com Visa.\n5. The interest rate offered to me was the lowest that they offer, and it is a between two and three percentage points lower than the other cards I have. I never carry a balance, so it doesn’t mean much to me.\n6. I had a false-alarm fraud alert shortly after I set it up. I made it my default on my Apple account, and a $30 annual subscription fee trigged a fraud alert. I contacted Apple Card support via iMessage, and cleared up the problem.\n7. Buying different things changes the color of the card in the Wallet app, which is amusing. The colors correspond to the spending charts.\n8. I had a lot of trouble adding the card to my Apple Watch. It took lots of fiddling with settings, but, fortunately, I did not have to unpair and repair the Apple Watch to my iPhone.\n9. The titanium card is boring and heavy. I expect to never use it. Its best feature is that my card number is not printed on it.\n10. Some common features are missing: a website, integration with personal finance applications, and joint accounts (or authorized users).\n\n\nBlog post: SwiftoDo Development Notes, July 2018 [https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/swiftodo-develop…-notes-july-2018/](https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/swiftodo-development-notes-july-2018/ \"https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/swiftodo-develop…-notes-july-2018/\")\n\nBlog post: [SwiftoDo Development Notes, July 2018](https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/swiftodo-development-notes-july-2018/)\n\n\n# 📚 Ready Player One, by Ernest Cline\nEarlier this year, I completed reading _[Ready Player One](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One)_ by Ernest Cline. It was the first novel that I had read in a while, as I have been reading mostly nonfiction in recent years. I discovered the book from an [episode of the “Triangulation” podcast in which Leo Laporte interviewed author Andy Weir](https://twit.tv/shows/triangulation/episodes/322), who enthusiastically recommended the book. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the book. The prose is efficient and the pacing is swift. I thought it started out strong, and I liked the world building and the build-up of suspense in the early chapters. After a while, though, I tired of all the 1980s video game and movie references, and wanted the book to end. While I was about three quarters through the book, I referred to it as “the reading equivalent to watching somebody else play video games”. For me, the stakes felt too low, and the characterizations were too thin, to make a lasting impression. Still, I had fun reading it, at least most of the way through.\n\n\n# Introducing The New Yorker Crossword Puzzle\n[The New Yorker just launched a crossword puzzle](https://www.newyorker.com/crossword/puzzles-dept/2018/04/30).\n\n> Most of our readers have e-mail addresses now, and the Web has given us the space to try new things—and to try old things again. In that spirit, we’re launching another crossword, online this time, and in the American style. It’ll be weekly, just like the magazine: a new one every Monday morning\n\nI am a daily crossword puzzle player. I enjoy them, though I am not terribly good at them, because I love word games and have read that crosswords help keep your mind sharp into old age.\n\nThe New Yorker puzzle is a _tiny_ bit more challenging than I would like (as I said, I’m not a strong player), but I’m happy there’s another source of crossword puzzles (beyond the New York Times, which I also subscribe to) coming may way.\n\nI hope they will someday move it into their iOS app. The scrolling behavior, which affects the on-page keyboard, is annoying on mobile.\n\n\n# Prolific Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo departs KGI Securities, likely to focus on companies other than Apple\n[Kuo’s departure](https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/30/prolific-apple-supply-chain-analyst-ming-chi-kuo-departs-kgi/) comes hot off the heels of [Apple’s recent “leaked” memo](https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/13/apple-memo-on-leaks-leaks/) about leaking that threatened the leaky leaders who leak. \n\n> Why has Ming-Chi Kuo, arguably one of the most popular technology analysts in the world, decided to move on? One possible reason is that his sources have done likewise, or perhaps have even been removed in light of Apple’s recent memo and strong stance against leaks — supply chain or otherwise.\n\nI wondered why myself, and figured that Apple has either threatened him, or his sources, with criminal lawsuits. I, for one, wouldn’t mind if Apple finally closed up all the leaks in its supply chain. While these leaks may benefit Apple investors, they don’t really benefit Apple fans that much.\n\n\nBlog post: [SwiftoDo Development Notes, April 2018](https://mjdescy.me/2018/04/28/swiftodo-development-notes-april-2018/)\n\n\n# How We Got To Now\nI recently finished reading Steen Johnson’s [How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/books/review/how-we-got-to-now-by-steven-johnson.html). It was a breezy and pleasurable read, full of interesting information. Johnson’s writing is clear, concise, and engaging throughout. \n\nAs a huge nerd who spent a lot of time in childhood perusing a science and technology encyclopedia, and a lot of time in my teens watching tech-related documentaries on Discovery and TLC (before those networks drifted to reality TV), I already knew a lot of the material. Still, it’s a wonderful read to anyone who loves the “history of ideas course” way of looking at disparate, seemingly unrelated things in everyday life, and drawing a through line that connects them all. Plus I learned new phrases that describe these unintended and intended technological and cultural developments—“hummingbird effects” and “the adjacent possible”—that I particularly like.\n\n\n# I miss Caesar salad\nIt seems to me that massive outbreaks of food borne illness are becoming more and more common. That [our current, worsening outbreak](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-outbreak-worsens-98-people-now-sick-n869681) is the *second* E. Coli outbreak tied to my favorite type of lettuce in the past six months or so, and it is so virulent, is making me feel worried about our food system, and pessimistic about my country’s will to improve it.\n\n> An outbreak of E. coli food poisoning linked to romaine lettuce has widened and has now made at least 98 people sick, federal health officials said Friday.\n> \n> More than half have had to be hospitalized because the strain of E. coli causing this outbreak is an especially nasty one, the officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said.\n> \n> People in 22 states have reported E. coli infections linked to the outbreak, the CDC and FDA said.\n\nI’m no expert in this, but I feel like we have several problems in our food system that have, in the past few decades, started to compound in dangerous ways that we should have seen coming. Some of these problems include overcrowding of animals, overuse of antibiotics in livestock, and over-concentration in production and processing. When bad hygiene infects food, it’s worse now than it used to be. The bacteria are more resistant to antibiotics, and the food, and food borne illness, is distributed all across the country.\n\nAnother annoyance to me, as a someone who has eaten some raw eggs (usually in cookie dough or homemade eggnog) and rare meat over the years, is that I have *never* gotten a food borne illness from those activities. I have, however, gotten terribly ill several times from eating restaurant salads, probably due to unwashed hands or vegetables. There are menu warnings about undercooked meat in every restaurant I go to, but none about the danger of eating unwashed vegetables.\n\nI am impatiently awaiting the day I can eat Caesar salads again.\n\n\nWhile I was on vacation, I wrote a series of blog posts about all my old speaker systems. My goal was to trace my journey from a normal person to an audiophile, as I upgrade my gear up over the years.\n\n1. [Speakers over the years](https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/10/speakers-over-the-years/)\n2. [My first speaker system](https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/11/my-first-speaker-system/)\n3.

				"content_html": "\n\n<p>A software update at work pushed out the virtual backgrounds feature for WebEx. Since my home office—at least the part of it that is <em>behind</em> me and not under my control— is a mess, I enabled it.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, it looks pretty awful. The background mostly leaves a halo around me un-obscured; sometimes it clips portions of my face or shoulder off. I have a very high-end laptop and a “very good” Logitech webcam (all webcams are terrible, I think), so I have concluded that WebEx’s technology is way behind Zoom’s, which does the virtual backgrounds flawlessly. I think I will leave virtual backgrounds on, for privacy reasons, and hope no one minds the weird visual side effects.</p>\n\n<p>I did not have to wait long for the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/\">Apple Music announcement</a> to drop.</p>\n\n<p>Apple Music can release its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439885/apple-music-tease-hi-fi-lossless-music-streaming\">rumored lossless tier</a> any minute now. I’m waiting with my best headphones. I don’t care at all about spatial audio or Dolby Atmos, though, so I hope that isn’t the only kind of thing coming.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"apple-is-poised-to-lose-its-antitrust-battle\">Apple is Poised to Lose its Antitrust Battle</h1>\n\n<p>I think that Apple is going to lose whatever antitrust cases are eventually brought against it in the EU and in the US. I don’t actually think Apple <em>should</em> lose, because I don’t think it is correct to call Apple a monopoly.</p>\n\n<p>The general antitrust argument against Apple is that its App Store platform is too locked down, and that is unfair because Apple is a monopoly (insert eye roll here) of its own platform. App is a platform owner. Of course it has a “monopoly” over the platform it owns. That doesn’t make it a monopoly in the overall marketplace. Moreover, while iOS is undoubtedly popular, it is a <em>minority</em> smartphone platform, which in the broadest legal terms that I understand, makes monopoly-related antitrust law not apply to them.</p>\n\n<p>App developers have to accept Apple’s terms, and pay a pretty large commission to Apple, to distribute apps in the store or to take in-app purchases. That may not feel fair to developers, but I can’t take seriously the arguments that it is illegal. It is the same way that game consoles work. Will we go after Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft next? Shouldn’t they open up their game consoles to alternative payment systems and alternate app stores, too? I have heard of no one seriously arguing this.</p>\n\n<p>The most compelling argument against Apple’s App Store requirements is that Apple demands too much money from developers for distribution and payment solutions that other companies now offer at lower prices. I am sympathetic to this argument because I too think Apple should have lowered its commission over the years, as marginal costs for these technologies and services have declined. However, the size of Apple’s cut is not really at issue here. Apple, rather clumsily, lowered its commission for a majority of its developers to 15%, starting in January 2021, but the antitrust talk just keeps rolling on.</p>\n\n<p>The second most compelling argument against Apple is that it uses its platform-owner advantage to position its own software and services over third-party competitors. Again, I sympathize. Apple Sherlocks developers sometimes, and can position its own software and services over anyone else’s. So does Microsoft (ever use Windows?). Amazon exercises a tremendous advantage over third party sellers in its online marketplace.</p>\n\n<p>I could argue that even Linux vendors, such as Ubuntu, position their own, preferred software over that of third-party developers. Software platform owners always have advantages over third parties that operate on their platform. Extracting as much value from that as is possible is the entire point of creating and owning a platform. I think it only becomes an antitrust problem when a company has majority market share, which Apple does not have.</p>\n\n<p>If developers can’t accept Apple’s terms, then they shouldn’t. They should develop for Android instead, which has the majority market share anyway, or create progressive web apps. (Remember, the web is an app platform, too, not just a way to collect credit card payments for software.) If developers “need” to develop for iOS because iOS users, on average, spend way more money on apps than Android users, then that just shows the value Apple’s marketplace has, and <em>is</em> worth paying for.</p>\n\n<p>Despite my views, I still think Apple is poised to lose any legal actions about them regarding monopoly. It won’t lose based on the merits of whatever case is brought against it; it will lose because enough political sentiment is against Apple, at least in this area, and that is all that matters. Perhaps all the tech giants will fall under this scrutiny, and all will be forced to open up their platforms more widely, and will be forced to renounce their first-party advantage when distributing applications and features. I just don’t see that actually happening, and if it does happen, I don’t think it will benefit anybody in the way government regulators would expect. It could even stifle the development of the next generation of technology platforms.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"is-a-higher-quality-apple-music-tier-on-the-way\">Is a higher-quality Apple Music tier on the way?</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2021/05/is-a-higher-quality-apple-music-tier-on-the-way/\">I hope so.</a> I am a sucker for lossless codecs, even though I probably can’t hear the difference between them and AAC-256.</p>\n\n<p>I have been using SQL for 25 years and I just learned today that <code>SELECT [...] FROM Table1, Table2</code> is called a “<a href=\"https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-basics/sql-server-cross-join/\">cross join</a>” an can also be expressed as <code>SELECT [...] FROM Table1 CROSS JOIN Table2</code>. 🤦 In my defense, I must say that I have only had to use a cross join a few times in my entire career.</p>\n\n<p>I unblocked Reddit.com earlier this week because the domain keeps coming up in tech question-related search results.

The interface looks a lot better, and it is a little easier to use. They didn’t change the keyboard hardware driver to support function layers, which is unfortunately. I really want that. (Honestly, what I want is the ObinsKit software that powers the Anne Pro 2 to apply work on it.)</p>\n\n<p>I set up a new RGB color scheme and remapped my CapsLock to Control, saved them to the keyboard’s local profile, and (out of habit) configured the Zeus Engine to <em>not</em> start every time I log on.

What I would expect is more I/O, driven by more cores and supported by more RAM. Of course, I could be wrong.

It is a puzzle game where you, essentially, build a machine with various component parts to move a ball (well, the game calls it a “binary cell”) from one part of the screen to another. It sounds simple, and it starts out fairly simple, but it becomes very challenging as you progress. It’s the sort of game a programmer, or anyone who enjoyed <em><a href=\"https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine\">Human Resource Machine</a></em> would enjoy.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"fez\">Fez 🎮</h1>\n\n<p>I am delighted that I discovered a video game that is <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/fez-switch/\">new to the Nintendo Switch</a>, but not at all new to the world, called <a href=\"http://www.fezgame.com\">Fez</a>. This is the game’s official blurb:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gomez is a 2D creature living in a 2D world. Or is he? When the existence of a mysterious 3rd dimension is revealed to him, Gomez is sent out on a journey that will take him to the very end of time and space. Use your ability to navigate 3D structures from 4 distinct classic 2D perspectives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is a 2D puzzle platformer where your character can rotate the environment left or right 90 degrees at a time, but you always interact with the environment in two dimensions. Some of the puzzles are quite challenging, but I think that the most hidden secrets that you can get from solving the hardest puzzles are all optional to completing the game. It’s a charming game, and easily my favorite Switch game of this year so far.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-shooting-likely-lasted-one-or-two-minutes\">The shooting likely lasted one or two minutes.</h1>\n\n<p>I am unsettled today by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/16/us/indianapolis-fedex-shooting#the-attack-is-the-latest-in-a-recent-series-of-mass-shootings-in-the-us\">yet another mass shooting</a> in my country. It seems like not a day goes by without a <em>New York Times</em> news alert about it. (I plan to turn those alerts off after I finish writing this.) This time, a gunman killed seven people, then himself. This detail about the story jumped out at me: “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/16/us/indianapolis-fedex-shooting#shooting-at-a-fedex-warehouse-in-indianapolis-leaves-8-dead\">The shooting likely lasted one or two minutes</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>I think the news media covers mass shootings like they are exciting, like some kind of action movie where bad outcomes only happen to the extras, and the rest of us get to watch. But “one or two minutes” isn’t an action movie. It isn’t something exciting. It’s actually, really, really stupid. That such a thing is even possible, outside a war, is embarrassing and shameful to all of us. I wish it were more widely considered to be.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"iphone-13-mini-could-be-the-last-mini-iphone-says-kuo\">iPhone 13 mini could be the last &lsquo;mini&rsquo; iPhone, says Kuo</h1>\n\n<p>Stephen Warwick reports in <em>iMore</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kuo says that next year Apple will drop the 5.4-inch model and run with two 6.1-inch models instead, one Pro, one regular.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This rumor is a prime reason I upgraded to the iPhone 12 mini early this year. I absolutely love the size and weight of it. It fits better in my hands and in my pockets than my iPhone 7 Plus ever did. However, the 12 mini’s small screen size makes it less compelling to read on, edit photos on, or watch videos on. These are all things I do pretty much every day without complaint, but if it were going to be my only portable device I would have bought one with a bigger screen.</p>\n\n<p>I have no desire to go back to a larger phone, because the phone, for me, is one tool among many, rather than the center of my computing universe. It doesn’t have to be compelling, just useful. It doesn’t have to be used constantly, just when it makes the most sense to.</p>\n\n<p>Some time from now, I think the smartphone, as a thing I carry around all the time, and as the default “Internet communication device,” is going to disappear and be replaced by something else: smart glasses maybe, or some kind of earpiece (when I am really old and need hearing aides).</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"my-first-nuget-package\">My First NuGet Package</h1>\n\n<p>Last night, I published my first <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/what-is-nuget\">NuGet</a> package: <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/TodoTxt.Library/1.0.0\">TodoTxt.Library</a>. It is a code library meant to help develop <a href=\"http://todotxt.org\">todo.txt</a> applications in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework\">.NET</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote the code back in 2015, <a href=\"https://github.com/mjdescy/TodoTxt.Library\">open-sourced it on GitHub</a>, but otherwise left it alone because I had moved on to more macOS and iOS development by that time. This week, I upgraded the code base work on .NET 5, so that it is cross platform (rather than Windows-only, as was my original version), and figured out how to package it and upload it to NuGet, where it may have a shot at actually being used.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"microsoft-announces-surface-laptop-4-with-choice-of-intel-or-amd-processors\">Microsoft announces Surface Laptop 4 with choice of Intel or AMD processors</h1>\n\n<p>Tom Warren’s article on <em>The Verge</em> caught my eye:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Microsoft is refreshing its Surface lineup with the Surface Laptop 4 today, which now offers the choice between AMD or Intel processors across both the 13.5- and 15-inch models. Both sizes will ship with Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors or AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series processors. Microsoft is shipping its Surface Laptop 4 on April 15th in the US, Canada, and Japan, starting at $999 for the AMD model and $1,299 for the Intel version — a $300 price gap between the pair.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If I was more of a Windows guy I would probably buy only Microsoft-brand laptops at this point. They don’t always have the best specs, but I like their designs a lot.</p>\n\n<p>I spend most of my computing time using Windows for work. I try to forget that I have a Lenovo laptop by putting it behind a giant monitor and using an external keyboard and trackball to operate it. Lenovo laptops are good, I guess, as long as I don’t have to touch them. I don’t like their keyboards (both in terms of layout and feel) or the pointing devices (the trackpad is too small, and I’m done with using the trackpoint/eraserhead thing). The Surface Laptops keyboards and trackpads have always seemed a lot more sensible to me in how they are designed.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"siri-reveals-apple-event-planned-for-tuesday-april-20\">Siri Reveals Apple Event Planned for Tuesday, April 20</h1>\n\n<p>I’m assuming that somebody’s job, every day, is to wake up in the morning and ask Siri “<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/13/siri-apple-event-tuesday-april-20/\">When is the next Apple Event</a>?” I’m glad I didn’t try to change careers back in 2009 or 2011 (when I thought of it) and get into tech journalism.</p>\n\n<p>I never would have predicted that in 2021 I would be using <a href=\"https://farmanager.com\">a text-mode file manager from the 1990s</a>, a <a href=\"https://github.com/VladimirMarkelov/ttdl\">command-line based to-do list program</a>, and, at least sometimes (by choice!), the <a href=\"https://www.vim.org\">Vim</a> text editor.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight I published a huge update to the website for my first iOS app: <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com\">SwiftoDo</a>. What was once a one page site with a very outdated template is now a Hugo-based site full of information. There is a lot more that I could add, it is now so much better than my old site I had to publish it.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"james-hoffman-s-aeropress-video\">James Hoffman’s AeroPress video</h1>\n\n<p>Last year when I was looking for something soothing to watch on YouTube, I came across James Hoffmann’s many videos about coffee, coffee machines, coffee products, and so on. I have watched a ton of them, mostly because I like his voice and demeanor. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/aidvrssMSGo\">His latest video</a> is about the <a href=\"https://aeropress.com\">AeroPress</a>, which I have used for many, many years. I actually learned something new from it: People use the funnel, which is meant to help put your coffee grounds into the press without making a mess, to brew coffee into cups with mouths too small for the bottom of the AeroPress. I have to try that! He also states in the video that the AeroPress is easy to make good coffee from, but is difficult to master. I actually put very little effort into my AeroPress use—far less than I used to when I first starting using it. I have found that my AeroPress brewing technique, no matter how sloppy or lazy, doesn’t seem to affect my coffee all that much. It prefer not stressing about it anymore.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"linux-on-the-m1-mac-mini\">Linux on the M1 Mac Mini</h1>\n\n<p>The Linux kernel is <a href=\"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/soc/soc.git/commit/?h=for-next&amp;id=0d5fe4b31785b732b71e764b55cda5c8d6e3bbbf\">gaining Apple M1 support</a>. I have been wondering if, years from now, I can move my M1 Mac Mini to a home app-server role, running Linux, when it gets too old for Xcode and stops getting macOS updates. I have a Celeron based PC doing that for me now, but it runs hot and can be noisy, too. If a machine can run Linux, it extends its lifespan considerably for me.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"my-first-failed-attempt-to-flash-qmk-on-my-mechanical-keyboard\">My (first) failed attempt to flash QMK on my mechanical keyboard</h1>\n\n<p>I wasted an hour last night trying to install <a href=\"https://qmk.fm\">QMK firmware</a> on my work computer’s mechanical keyboard, a <a href=\"https://www.durgod.com/page9?product_id=47&amp;_l=en\">Durgod Taurus K320</a>. I have a love/hate relationship with it. I love that it has the best build quality, rigidity, stabilization, keycaps, and typing feel and sound of any of the many (many!) keyboards I have owned over the years. I hate that its software is buggy: so buggy that sometimes the keyboard hangs and I have to unplug it to fix it; so buggy that I have to plug it in directly to my laptop rather than through a USB hub; so buggy that that I cannot program its layers the way I want to.</p>\n\n<p>Very recently, someone figured out how to run QMK firmware on it, which could resolve the stability and customizability problems I have with the board. Unfortunately, I was not able to figure out how to flash the firmware to the keyboard. The main problem I faced was that the keyboard was not recognized by the QMK Toolkit software (on Windows) even after I put the keyboard into bootloader mode, and even after I started messing with the bootloader firmware using <a href=\"https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/guides/driver_installation_zadig\">Zadig</a>.</p>\n\n<p>After lots of tries, I couldn’t figure out. I think I dodged a bullet, though, because I’m not sure QMK can control the RGB backlighting, which, on this keyboard, is necessary to see the key legends. Fortunately, despite me trying to mess with it, my keyboard still works as well as it did before. It’s not perfect, and I really would like to create a more robust <code>Fn</code> (function key) layer, but I will live with it for now.</p>\n\n<p>🎵 I’m listening to <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/for-her/1499733036?i=1499733045\"><em>Gaslighter</em> by The Chicks</a> again today. It is one of my favorite albums of 2020. Everything is great about it, from the catchy choruses to the close harmonies to the clean production. My favorite part of it is the songwriting, which is fueled with righteous anger and makes for compelling country-pop music.</p>\n\n<p>Today I made the mistake to look up someone I knew while I was in high school. I was reading an article about illegal drugs, and thought about a high school friend’s younger brother who ran into some drug problems about 20 years ago. Sadly, I discovered that he died last year. I can only conjecture, but it seems, based on what else happened to him over the past few years, that drug problems led to his premature death. Learning about what happened to him made me very sad.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"apple-arcade-just-got-a-huge-update-of-new-games-including-some-mobile-classics\">Apple Arcade just got a huge update of new games, including some mobile classics</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362388/apple-arcade-game-subscription-update-monument-valley-threes-iphone-ipad\">As reported by Andrew Webster in <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apple’s gaming subscription service just got a massive influx of new titles. The headliner is Fantasian — the latest release from the creator of Final Fantasy — which is joined by other titles like new versions of NBA 2K and The Oregon Trail, and World of Demons from PlatinumGames. As part of the update, the service is getting two new categories of games: Apple calls them “Timeless Classics” and “App Store Greats.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I literally just canceled my (second) Apple Arcade free trial twelve hours before this announcement. I just can’t seem to get into Apple Arcade at all. For the most part, the reason is that I find my iPhone 12 mini to be too small to be a compelling gaming device. Secondarily, I don’t want to get into a complex, involved game on my iPhone or iPad. I prefer my mobile games to be simple things that can be jumped into and out of, more like the “Timeless Classics” that Apple is now adding to Apple Arcade. It’s too bad for Apple Arcade that I already own almost all of those games.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"fully-vaccinated-people-may-travel-cdc-says\">Fully vaccinated people may travel, CDC says</h1>\n\n<p>As reported by Lena H. Sun and Lori Aratani in <em>The Washington Post</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Federal health officials gave the green light Friday for fully vaccinated people to resume travel as an estimated 100 million Americans have had at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine, and evidence mounts of the shots’ effectiveness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s good news, but it doesn’t make me want to go out and travel by plane or train anytime soon.</p>\n\n<p>I am fully vaccinated, but my kids are not (because, of course, there is no approved vaccine for children yet), and that dramatically limits my desire to travel, eat in indoor restaurants, or do any indoor activities in public unless they are absolutely necessary. I understand that it is probably quite safe for me to do some of these activities (provided I wear a mask, etc.), but it seems to me that doing so would still be (even more) uncomfortable and unpleasant (than it was before).</p>\n\n<p>My wife and I have been talking every day about what is OK or not OK for us to do now that we are vaccinated. Despite both being vaccinated, we are still not comfortable dining in restaurants or staying in hotels (don’t even talk about flying!), but we have realized that we are way behind our friends and acquaintances in terms of risk taking. We remain concerned about our children being explored to the virus, and about the rising and “extremely high” (per <em>The New York Times</em>) COVID-19 risk level our county is currently at. It just doesn’t make sense for us to change our behavior that much yet—at least not until the local COVID infection numbers go down quite a bit, which won’t happen until after a lot more people get vaccinated.</p>\n\n<p>⚾️ For the first time in over a year I have a baseball game on in the background as I work. I hope to get by the with MLB “free game of the day” offering this year, rather than paying to subscribe to the season package. There was no free game for the season opener yesterday, though, so I’m watching a spring training game.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"openai-s-text-generating-system-gpt-3-is-now-spewing-out-4-5-billion-words-a-day\">OpenAI’s text-generating system GPT-3 is now spewing out 4.5 billion words a day</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356180/openai-gpt-3-text-generation-words-day\">James Vincent reports in <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The best-known AI text-generator is OpenAI’s GPT-3, which the company recently announced is now being used in more than 300 different apps, by “tens of thousands” of developers, and producing 4.5 billion words per day. That’s a lot of robot verbiage. This may be an arbitrary milestone for OpenAI to celebrate, but it’s also a useful indicator of the growing scale, impact, and commercial potential of AI text generation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The obvious industry target for auto-text is journalism. It is already being used there for sports reporting, and could probably be used for local government reporting too. There are other areas it will encroach on that are news-adjacent (think financial news or business book digest services like Blinkist), like education and entertainment.</p>\n\n<p>I’m an auditor, and I think that, eventually, auto-text is going to destroy about 50% of our billable hours. Auditors spend a <em>ton</em> of time writing. We document our procedures. We record our work. We summarize our findings. We write reports for our clients. Making sense of all the work, both for our own understanding and for our client’s, for the sake of writing it down, takes a lot of time. Moreover, the simple act of typing it out and, especially, hyperlinking everything together so we support our conclusions, requires a lot of manual work. Some of this work is communicative, but a lot of it (like the hyperlinking part) is mechanical. Consequently, much of it is ripe for automation.</p>\n\n<p>I think, though, that transforming this laborious and time-consuming writing process into something auto-generated by a bot would produce a lot more <em>information</em> but a lot less <em>knowledge</em> than we had before. You gain a lot more understanding how a company, business process, or control works by writing about it than by reading about it. Why? Because writing is <em>thinking</em>. To write well is mentally strenuous. It requires you to think how you would communicate an idea to someone else, notably someone else with a different perspective and different knowledge than you have. At the end of the writing process, you should understand your subject backwards and forwards and from all sides; you could probably describe it in a number of different ways; and you will likely remember the gist of it, and specific nuances about it, for far longer than you would if you had just read about it in a report.</p>\n\n<p>The world won’t end, and few will shed tears, when AI writes audit reports and work papers. Audits cost money, and businesses mostly don’t think they benefit from them. If it makes the auditors less knowledgeable, however, side effects will develop, and those will be long-lasting. Knowledgable auditors help make good control environments possible, which leads to more stable and more solvent companies. Decreasing the understanding of auditors could make systems and processes more unstable and less trustworthy over time. Additionally, knowledgable auditors often move to the business side and go on to manage well-controlled organizations. While the auditor-to-manager career path will likely continue, such moves would not result in the same level of management quality if the auditors don’t have to think as deeply about what they are auditing as they did before the AI text-bots took over. Neither of these side effects bodes particularly well for the people the auditors and the audited companies (and their fancy AI) serve.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"there-is-no-perfect-template-just-pick-one\">There is no perfect template—just pick one</h1>\n\n<p>I stayed up late last night drafting a new, Hugo-driven version of one of my websites. I went from having nothing at all built to having about one third of the site done in a couple hours. The result, I think, will be more plain (and maybe more ugly) than the existing site, but it will be less janky on mobile devices.</p>\n\n<p>I sank a lot of time over the past week looking for a Hugo theme that is perfect for my needs, but I couldn’t find one. For the sake of achieving my simple goal of refreshing my tiny websites, I gave up the goal of visual perfection, and am driving forward with a theme that I think is OK that works well enough for me.</p>\n\n<p>From my perspective, I want my site to be easier to maintain and add content. That is more important to me than having a site that looks really slick. My old websites don’t look slick anymore, anyway: No one is fooled by outdated HTML templates into thinking that my very niche apps are developed by a huge, sophisticated software corporation.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-organizational-rabbit-hole\">The organizational rabbit hole</h1>\n\n<p>This is a short, short version of what happened to me over the past week when I decided to get organized.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Form a desire to organize my project files differently.</li>\n<li>Discover the <a href=\"https://johnnydecimal.com\">Johnny Decimal</a> system.</li>\n<li>Create a taxonomy for my files in a text file.</li>\n<li>Start writing PowerShell script to switch folders based on the Johnny Decimal number</li>\n<li>Start writing a PowerShell script to index all the Johnny Decimal numbers in my folder tree</li>\n<li>Think about working with files from the command line more often</li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://midnight-commander.org\">Midnight Commander</a> for a command line file manager</li>\n<li>Learn a lot of Midnight Commander shortcuts and customizations</li>\n<li>Learn about <a href=\"https://farmanager.com\">Far Manager</a>, which is a lot like Midnight Commander but works much better on Windows</li>\n<li>Run into keyboard shortcut conflicts with Windows Terminal</li>\n<li>Learn about assigning and removing keyboard shortcuts in Windows Terminal</li>\n<li>Start thinking about using <a href=\"http://todotxt.org\">todo.txt</a> from the Windows Terminal, because my <a href=\"https://www.taskpaper.com\">TaskPaper</a> file has been too big for months and is awful to work with</li>\n<li>Tried to find a todo.txt command line app for Windows that works on my machine</li>\n<li>Thought about writing my own todo.txt command line app using an old C# library I created</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>And&hellip;I still haven’t organized anything yet. 😅</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier\">The Falcon and the Winter Soldier 📺</h1>\n\n<p>I watched episode one of <a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/tv-shows/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier/1\"><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a> this week. It’s a show about two <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe\">MCU</a> characters I don’t particularly care that much about, so it wasn’t something I was really looking forward to, but I pay for Disney+ anyway and thought I may as well check it out. Reader, I liked it!</p>\n\n<p>My first impression is that it looks like it cost a zillion dollars. Special-effects-wise, it looks on par with the Marvel movies. Based on that alone, I could see why Disney originally wanted it to premiere first, before <em>WandaVision</em> and whatever other Marvel shows are being developed.</p>\n\n<p>My second impression is that I appreciated that it was trying to tell a Black story as well as a super hero story. I am not optimistic that Sam’s (The Falcon’s) family side story is going to be anything but predictable, but it is nice to see an attempt to give the character some grounding in reality. Race is an issue that touches everything in American life, unfortunately. In some ways, it would be disrespectful to Sam’s character and to the audience not to address that in some way.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t have anything bad to say about the Winter Soldier part of the show, but it isn’t as interesting to me. I expect it to follow a predictable “antihero almost, but doesn’t quite, make good” formula, but maybe the writers will surprise me.</p>\n\n<p>Predictability aside, I’m just glad to have something new and fun to watch.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-menu-key\">The menu key</h1>\n\n<p>I was thinking about creating a training presentation to help my coworkers with keyboards shortcuts, but was dismayed to see that our Lenovo laptop keyboards (which I never use, because I work from home and use external peripherals) don’t even have a menu key. Someone decided that <code>Print Screen</code> was more important, which may even be true, but it doesn’t help me make a good presentation for my coworkers. The menu key alternative, <code>Shift+F10</code> is going to be a very hard sell, especially because <code>F10</code> on the laptop requires the <code>Fn</code> key to be pressed, too.</p>\n\n<p>I have gone from someone who did not use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_key\">menu key</a> on my keyboard for 20+ years (since it was invented in the 1990s) to someone who can’t live without it (on my Windows at least). I made it a point to start using it a few months ago, and now I use it constantly. I recommend that all Windows users with an ANSI or ISO keyboard layout check it out. That key is positioned right underneath your thumb when you use the arrow keys.</p>\n\n<p>🎵 “<a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/canadas-country/pl.f2da318b2e1a4f358f10efc2021cba6e\">Canada’s Country</a>”: I’ve been enjoying this laid-back playlist while I work.

I’m glad I did.</p>\n\n<p>I thought the theatrical release of <em>Justice League</em> was pretty bad, but not quite as bad as the professional movie review consensus was. I figured that the Snyder cut must be better, but I was surprised at how much better it is. Granted, it still isn’t <em>good</em>. It doesn’t fix its pacing problems. It still is not as brisk and pleasurable as the best of the Marvel movies. It doesn’t tell a cohesive story, but it also crams in too many story lines for a non-DC fan to keep track of. It still has some dumb script problems, such every single part of the nonsensical museum height/terrorist bombing blot in the opening Wonder Woman scene, that could have been solved by editing a few sentences of dialog. While not exactly <em>good</em>, it is a good bad movie now. Its reach often exceeds its grasp, but it offers a lot of interesting material to people who are already fans. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to be the kind of movie that would bring a lot new fans in.</p>\n\n<p>It is now very clear to me that Zach Snyder’s vision was dark and wild and weird—definitely too much of all of those things to launch a successful franchise—but Joss Whedon’s contributions were just awful: tasteless, asinine, nonsensical, and insulting to the audience. Whedon’s dialog (notably Superman’s and The Flash’s) and the character moments he created, like the race between The Flash and Superman, are embarrassing to watch and make the characters seem stupid. Snyder’s cut simply had better dialog for them. Simply getting rid of the random <em>people</em> that Whedon put into that nuclear wasteland Russian city—the one that existed in the movie only to be destroyed in a bout of cinematic excess—made the climax bearable. Who needs to worry about a family who shouldn’t be living in a nuclear wasteland anyway when the entire world is already at stake? Whedon really did screw up that movie.</p>\n\n<p>I think that the Snyder Cut works very well for fans of the comics, especially fans of the “what-if” versions of all the famous characters. Some fans, like me, believe that comic book characters are archetypes, and really can be <em>anything</em>, and no representation of them is truly canonical. The grim, dark version of the Justice League is an interesting thought experiment, one of many worth exploring. It is not something I ever felt hung up on as “not the real version” of Superman or whatever. The Snyder Cut isn’t the real version of the DC Universe to me, because nothing is. It’s all just ideas and entertainment anyway.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"alt-f4\">Alt+F4</h1>\n\n<p>I have been using <a href=\"https://www.autohotkey.com\">AutoHotKey</a> for many years, and I never thought until today to map <code>Windows+Q</code> to quit the active app and close the active window. That creates something very similar to Mac’s <code>Command+Q</code> shortcut to Windows.</p>\n\n<p>The default Windows keyboard shortcut for quitting an app is <code>Alt+F4</code>, which is a two hand operation for me. Note that in AutoHotKey, you don’t even need to send that key command; you can use the WinClose function instead:</p>\n\n<p>#q::\nWinClose, A\nReturn</p>\n\n<p>One of the best things Apple has ever done with their support of keyboard shortcuts was to pretend that function keys (<code>F1</code> through <code>F12</code>) don’t exist.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"intel-invests-20-billion-into-new-factories-will-produce-chips-for-other-companies\">Intel invests $20 billion into new factories, will produce chips for other companies</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing\">Chiam Gartenberg reports in <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the company’s “Engineering the Future” announcement today, Gelsinger announced plans to outsource more of Intel’s chip production to third-party foundries; a $20 billion investment into two new fabs in Arizona; and a new branch of the company called Intel Foundry Services, which will see Intel’s foundries produce chips for other companies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Intel has had an awful decade, having missed out on smartphone chips and having stalled out at their 14nm process for years. Still, it is a strategically important company for my country, and I have to ill will toward it, even if I don’t prefer their products right now. I would love to see them become competitive again.</p>\n\n<p>The idea of Intel fabbing chips for other companies is a big deal. Intel has never done that before. It seems to me like it could be the first step of spinning off that part of the business into its own company, and focusing on process shrinks in ways that the fully integrated Intel could not before.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"seven-mass-shootings-in-seven-days\">Seven mass shootings in seven days</h1>\n\n<p>Josh Berlinger of <em>CNN</em> reports today that <a href=\"http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_d3f4ea80ea0d81acb5d30fcf939c3243\">the Colorado attack is the 7th mass shooting in 7 days in the US</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It seemed like there were periods in recent years in which we had a deadly mass shooting in the national news at least every week, if not several times each week. There has been something of a pause due to COVID, for understandable reasons. Unfortunately, we seem to be un-pausing now. Sadly, mass shooting rates in the U.S. seem to be getting back to normal.</p>\n\n<p>But what is “normal?” It is actually hard to know what is normal for gun violence in the U.S. Here’s an interesting factoid from the article about my country’s gun problem:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s unclear how this number of mass shootings compares to an average week in the US.</p>\n\n<p>Though some official gun violence data is available, the US federal government does not have a centralized system or database to track firearm incidents and mass shootings nationwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks some gun violence data, nearly 40,000 people were killed in incidents involving firearms in 2019.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The article omits the reason for this: There are actually <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-government-study-gun-violence/story?id=50300379\">laws against government agencies, such as the CDC, accurately tracking gun violence</a>. That’s just stupid and self-defeating. While dying due to gun violence is incredibly unlikely, statistically speaking, it is also completely unnecessary. We should treat <a href=\"https://usafacts.org/data/topics/security-safety/crime-and-justice/firearms/firearm-deaths/\">all gun deaths</a> as <em>preventable</em> and <em>unacceptable</em>. Only then can we have the mental and moral clarity to do something about it.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"ulysses-and-micro-blog\">Ulysses and Micro.blog</h1>\n\n<p>It is amazing that <a href=\"https://blog.ulysses.app/ulysses-22/\">Ulysses supports posting to Micro.blog now</a>. I love the functionality, and its inclusion definitely cements Ulysses as my only writing app on iOS and macOS at this point.</p>\n\n<p>Now let’s bug the Ulysses team to do some other cool things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Implement publishing workflows, by which publishing a sheet can automatically trigger the sheet to be tagged with a keyword, be moved to a particular folder (such as “published”), or call an iOS Shortcut.</li>\n<li>Make every command accessible via a hardware keyboard shortcut. (I’m thinking mainly of the iPad version.)</li>\n<li>Add a command palette, like Visual Studio Code and Sublime Text have.</li>\n<li>Support <a href=\"https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/\">Mermaid</a>, a text-based markup language for creating flowcharts, in fenced code blocks, like <a href=\"https://typora.io\">Typora</a> does.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1 id=\"cdc-says-schools-can-now-space-students-3-feet-apart-rather-than-6\">CDC Says Schools Can Now Space Students 3 Feet Apart, Rather Than 6</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://text.npr.org/978608714\">As Anya Kamenetz, Cory Turner, and Allison Aubrey report on the <em>NPR</em> website today</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its guidance for schools. On Friday, the agency announced it &ldquo;now recommends that, with universal masking, students should maintain a distance of at least 3 feet in classroom settings.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Previously the guidance stated, &ldquo;Physical distancing (at least 6 feet) should be maximized to the greatest extent possible.&rdquo; The new guidelines still call for 6 feet of distance between adults and students as well as in common areas, such as auditoriums, and when masks are off, such as while eating. And the 6-foot distancing rule still applies for the general public in settings such as grocery stores.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This news is causing a good deal of consternation in my family. COVID cases are going up in our local schools right now. There has been an extremely high risk level in the community for several weeks, and in-person instruction is expanding anyway. Our school systems have been flatly stating that they will open even though they cannot conform with some of the requirements. This change in CDC requirements makes it easier for them to comply.</p>\n\n<p>I think the changing of, and complexity in, the distancing rules makes them seem suspect and less likely to be followed at all. This concern is counterbalanced, however, by my belief that distancing helps very little in the classroom, because every classroom I have seen has poor ventilation. My wife and I are keeping our kids remote until the end of the school year. We are still hopeful enough to consider September as the right time to send them back to in-person learning.</p>\n\n<p>🎵 I’m currently listening to <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/chemtrails-over-the-country-club/1545567745\"><em>Chemtrails over the Country Club</em></a> by Lana Del Ray for the first time. I have been waiting for this one. Lana Del Ray is one of my favorite artists.

Now I can’t keep up with my email; it comes in too fast, and I actually have work to do that demands my attention. Consequently, my Inbox is almost never empty.</p>\n\n<p>Now, mostly on Fridays, I just select all my Inbox emails (<code>Ctrl-A</code>) and move them to my Archive folder (<code>Ctrl-Shift-1</code> thanks to an <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/automate-common-or-repetitive-tasks-with-quick-steps-b184f89f-3738-4562-96de-c0244ea830f2\">Outlook Quick Step</a> I created), whether I have processed them or not. The emails aren’t deleted, they are just out of my Inbox, and that’s good enough.</p>\n\n<p>I am investing some time trying to see if I could implement a <a href=\"https://johnnydecimal.com\">Johnny Decimal</a> system for my files at work. Some of the constraints are tricky to deal with, but the general idea of it dovetails into what I have been doing for organization, and takes it one or two steps further.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"apple-s-new-ipad-pro-leaks-ahead-of-rumored-event\">Apple&rsquo;s new iPad Pro leaks ahead of rumored event</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-new-ipad-pro-leaks-ahead-of-rumored-event/\">Corinne Reichert and Stephen Shankland report in <em>CNET</em></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apple will launch a series of new iPads in April, a report Wednesday said. The new iPad Pros will come with Apple&rsquo;s homemade M1 chips, a Thunderbolt port, and better cameras and screens, according to Bloomberg. They will reportedly come in 11- and 12.9-inch display sizes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s cool. Maybe I’m not a “Pro” but the iPad Air 4 is just about perfect for me. From my layman’s perspective, the A14-based chip in the iPad Air 4 is very similar to the M1, minus some of the cores. The 2020 iPad Pro’s chip (an A12Z) is a generation or two behind that, though it has more cores than the A14 does. Apple obviously needs to remedy that to help justify the iPad Pro’s greater price.</p>\n\n<p>I am thinking that the “Thunderbolt” port is merely following the direction that everything with a USB-C connector is going in: USB 4 compatibility. That, plus more processor cores, sounds good for videographers, podcasters, photographers, and (I guess) gamers. Unfortunately, if Apple doesn’t fix some problems with the Files app (just try transferring a gigabyte-sized file off your iPad to a network share—I’ll wait&hellip;for it to fail), these performance boosts will be hamstrung.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"effective-presentations\">Effective Presentations</h1>\n\n<p>When it comes to creating effective PowerPoint presentations for work, my reach still exceeds my grasp.</p>\n\n<p>I know a lot of important concepts, including the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The slide deck is a visual aid, <em>not</em> the presentation</li>\n<li>Focus on one idea per slide</li>\n<li>Focus on very few visual elements/focus points per slide (e.g., five or six, maximum)</li>\n<li>Light text on a dark background is easier on the eye</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, when I try to apply those ideas, I feel like I’m not getting anywhere. All of my slides look completely conventional: no better than those I created many years ago. I think they are effective, but they are ugly and boring. It does not help that I have to present on topics that are dry and technical in nature. I also feel hamstrung by my company’s PowerPoint template, which is quite busy, focuses attention on the wrong areas of the slide (i.e., the title and the footer), and has (almost completely) black text on a white background.</p>\n\n<p>I think I need to invent a visual style that I can get away with on at least some of my slides:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Full-bleed images that cover the entire slide, and obviate the need for titles or footers on my slides.</li>\n<li>Text boxes that float over the images, or captions that fill in the top title area that is already part of our PowerPoint template.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I just hope, if I do these things, my slides won’t end up looking like tired internet memes.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"team-building-call-with-lindsi-swartz-2021-03-09\">Team-building call with Lindsi Swartz 2021-03-09</h1>\n\n<p>Background:</p>\n\n<p>Health administration</p>\n\n<p>Business school</p>\n\n<p>Filling out testing worksheets.</p>\n\n<p>Looking up procedure codes on findacode.com.</p>\n\n<p>🎵 The Hold Steady’s latest album, <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/open-door-policy/1539020630\">Open Door Policy</a>, is growing on me. I know reviewers love it, because it is a return to form, but I was hoping for something different. It’s hard to say, what, though. Something that’s a mix of fun and depressing, like my favorite Hold Steady lyrics, I guess.</p>\n\n<p>🎵 I loved all of the “Playlists from Visionary Women” that were front-and-center on Apple Music for International Women’s Day today. I’m glad they are still there today on the “Browse” page.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"apple-discontinues-original-homepod-will-focus-on-mini\">Apple discontinues original HomePod, will focus on mini</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-will-focus-on-mini/\">Matthew Panzarino of <em>TechCrunch</em> reports</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apple has discontinued its original HomePod after four years. It says that it will continue to produce and focus on the HomePod mini, introduced last year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I, like many audiophiles, passed on the original HomePod due to its high price and lack of connectivity. I’m sure I would have enjoyed how it sounded, and its size is just right for me, but I would likely have had to buy two of them to be fully satisfied (stereo separation is important to me). At $349 each, that was too expensive.</p>\n\n<p>The smaller, cheaper HomePod mini holds little appeal to me, and seems to be a far less interesting product for the audio engineers at Apple to work on. For all I know, though, it sells in huge numbers, which makes it interesting in and of itself. Maybe a HomePod mini max (ha!) will be released someday, at around $150, which will hit the price/performance sweet spot I am looking for.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-covid-versary\">The COVID-versary</h1>\n\n<p>I guess, based on the occurrence of a President Biden speech, that this week marks <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/Voices/2021/03/12/Joe-Biden-COVID-19-anniversary-speech-full-text/8161615555448/\">the one-year anniversary of COVID-19 in the United States</a>. To me, the baleful presence of COVID-19 has been around for what feels like much, much longer—<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic\">so long that I can’t even remember it clearly</a>.</p>\n\n<p>My COVID panic started in early <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_January_2020\">January</a>, when we thought the disease was only in Wuhan. In America, for a couple weeks at least, it still seemed likely that the disease would never leave China, much like H1N1 and SARS never made a big impact here. For almost three months my mental state caromed between what I think of now as irrational fear and rational fear. I could see the whole year of 2020 play out in my imagination, way before my friends and family could see what was coming, but I could do nothing to stop it, and I could do almost nothing to protect my family from it. All those feelings felt very real and very debilitating, even when almost no one else around me was feeling them.</p>\n\n<p>I had about two months of angst about COVID before it actually hit around here. The last time I went out with friends and family was, I think, on March 14, 2020. We went to see a musical and when out to eat at a crowded restaurant afterward. It was really hard for me to feel comfortable the entire time, but I didn’t want to let everybody down because I was concerned about a pandemic that hadn’t hit our area yet. Less than a week later, my entire family was on lockdown.</p>\n\n<p>Back in January, February, and early March 2020, it didn’t help me at all to have known about the scope and length and shape of prior pandemics, like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu\">Spanish Flu</a>, which I know, from reading family letters, killed a bunch of people in my extended family about a hundred years ago. It didn’t help me at all to know what I should do and buy to prepare for it. It didn’t help me at all that I am smart enough to think for myself and to scrutinize, with a pretty good understanding of the relevant science and statistics, the information and advice experts were providing to us. All of these things just made me feel more uncertain and more cynical about what was going on.</p>\n\n<p>A year later, I am feeling more hopeful. I have the vaccine after all, and am probably (but not definitely) immune to COVID 18. But my <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/monmouth-new-jersey-covid-cases.html\">county is still at extremely high risk level</a>. The numbers are still higher than they were last year when all of us were in a panic. Despite that, all the states, even blue states like mine, are reopening rapidly and throwing caution to the wind, when it would be more prudent to do so more gradually. It makes me nervous that we are giving the virus a chance to circulate long enough to adapt resistance to our vaccines.</p>\n\n<p>I was early in being scared of COVID, and I may be late in getting over that fear. I just hope that, when I look forward from today, whatever fear I feel is merely anxiety over things that will not play out, rather than the accurate foresight into the future that I had late last winter.</p>\n\n<p>There was <a href=\"https://www.nj.com/news/2021/03/large-lakewood-brush-fire-closes-portion-of-gsp.html\">a brush fire yesterday not too far from where I live</a>. Brush fires are incredibly rare where I live, so this is a curiosity to me. We have had dry, windy weather for about two weeks now, which makes wildfire conditions rife. My family was outside yesterday but fortunately we didn’t notice it; we must have been upwind.</p>\n\n<p>I’m probably being a climate-change alarmist right now, but I think we have never had such frequent windstorms in New Jersey as we have had this winter.</p>\n\n<p>I am grateful that the weather has changed from snowy and blustery to warm and calm. I have been able to take a walk after my lunch break for two days in a row. It feels nice.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"this-is-the-reality-of-black-girls-inauguration-poet-says-she-was-tailed-by-guard\">&lsquo;This Is The Reality Of Black Girls&rsquo;: Inauguration Poet Says She Was Tailed By Guard</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://text.npr.org/974362036\">Matthew S. Schwartz reports for NPR</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>To millions of people around the world, the young poet Amanda Gorman represents hope, change and the promise of a better America.</p>\n\n<p>But to a security guard on Friday night, the young African American woman represented a potential threat to public safety.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a sad story. My first thought was that Amanda Gorman could legitimately have been harmed in a situation like this. Then I thought, she should have a bodyguard or an entourage with her at all times for protection. <em>Then</em> I thought, she should not need to! That could ruin her life.</p>\n\n<p>Amanda Gorman is a strong and bold speaker, and deserves the last word on the matter:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;In a sense, he was right,&rdquo; the former National Youth Poet Laureate added. &ldquo;I AM A THREAT: a threat to injustice, to inequality, to ignorance. Anyone who speaks the truth and walks with hope is an obvious and fatal danger to the powers that be.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1 id=\"mermaid-for-flowcharts\">Mermaid 🧜‍♀️ for flowcharts</h1>\n\n<p>Tonight I learned about <a href=\"https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/\">Mermaid</a>, which is a plaintext markup language and renderer for creating flowcharts and other kinds of diagrams.</p>\n\n<p>I want to make flowcharts quickly for my technical projects at work, but i don’t have Visio, and I hate fiddling with a GUI to line up shapes and worry about arrow lengths and so on. The way my mind works, I just want to type out what I want and have software figure out how to lay it out for me. I don’t care that much how it looks, as long as it is simple and makes sense.</p>\n\n<p>Mermaid’s plaintext premise is really cool, and the syntax is flexible enough to not be awful. It is way more flexible than the examples on The Mermaid website originally led me to believe. You can name each shape whatever you like (not just single letter identifiers) and you can define the content (shapes) and relationships (arrows) separately if you want to. The only thing that stinks is that you have to manually insert html break tags (<code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>) for line breaks, because there is no word wrap.</p>\n\n<p>I still need to figure out what the best renderer is for me.

That person must bind her mind to the mech through a lot of hand-wavey technology called gen:lock.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is, we learn three things in the final two episodes of season 1 that make the pilots unnecessary:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A person’s mind can uploaded to, and downloaded from, a digital brain</li>\n<li>A digital brain can be copied an indefinite number of times.</li>\n<li>A digital brain is all that is needed to drive a mech</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If one pilot’s mind can be copied, without harming her, and then bound to any number of mechs, then why do we need the pilots at all, once you’ve got the first one’s mind copied? If the pilots aren’t really necessary, why haven’t the characters in charge of the gen:lock program figured that out yet?</p>\n\n<p>I’m not sure I will pick it up again when season 2 comes out. Maybe this kind of anime isn’t for me.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"neera-tanden-is-biden-s-first-cabinet-level-nominee-to-withdraw\">Neera Tanden is Biden’s first Cabinet-level nominee to withdraw</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/3/2/22310271/neera-tanden-biden-omb-withdraws\">Ella Nilson at vox.com reports</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But much of Tanden’s résumé was overshadowed by her proliferous online posting — at least 1,000 tweets raking both Republicans and leftist Democrats over the coals — that Tanden quietly started deleting in November 2020.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I haven’t been following this story, but my interest was piqued when I learned that Neera Tanden’s nomination chances were in jeopardy because of her tweets from the past. People keep getting in trouble for what they post to Twitter. (“Social media” in these cases always is Twitter, too. That is probably just because it is public facing, though it is also a popular place for broadcasting, calling out, and grandstanding.)</p>\n\n<p>It will soon be the conventional wisdom that those who seek high offices—in public service or in private industry—should have no public social media presence, no blog—certainly no Twitter account—maybe no public online presence at all. That bothers me because I think there is value in publishing one’s thoughts to the world, in a blog, vlog, podcast, or whatever other medium I can&rsquo;t even conceive of yet. People have an urge to share and should not feel that they will be punished for it, especially years after they tap the “post” button.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that some people are deliberately awful on social media, and that <em>is</em> a problem, but isn&rsquo;t it also a problem that “the Internet never forgets?” <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten\">The right to be forgotten</a> is at both ridiculous to ask for and essential for people to get along with each other after a certain point. How should we evaluate a person based on what she posted online? Does it matter how long ago a thought was posted? What is fair? I think we are at a cultural crossroads regarding these questions, and may be stuck at that crossroads for a long, long time.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"trust\">Trust</h1>\n\n<p>Trust relies on three things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Competence—can you do something well?</li>\n<li>Benevolence—are you doing good?</li>\n<li>Integrity—will you do the right thing, even when things are bad for you?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I heard this breakdown on a podcast episode earlier this week, and loved the idea so much that I hastily dictated a note to Siri about it (I was in my car at the time), but I can’t recall which podcast I heard it on or who said it. I found an analogous summary of the idea on the Wiley Online Library site, in an abstract about a chapter of the book <em><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119206422.ch21\">Handbook of Principles of Organizational Behavior: Indispensable Knowledge for Evidence‐Based Management, Second Edition</a></em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This chapter focuses on using the concepts of ability, benevolence, and integrity as a means of increasing trust. Ability, benevolence, and integrity are the most critical facets of trustworthiness. They foster a sense of trust in the leader by followers. Ability reflects the knowledge, skills, and aptitudes of a leader, in both technical areas and general management competencies. Benevolence and integrity are aspects of the leader&rsquo;s character, and require more time and attention on the part of followers before they can be reliably judged. In order to increase trust, leaders need to take steps to increase their ability, build their benevolence, and demonstrate their integrity. Leaders can do so on a follower‐by‐follower basis, but can also take steps to create a culture of trustworthiness within their organizations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Breaking down concepts like “trust”—which seem innately understood and obvious—into component parts can be very powerful. It gives you a way “in” when it comes to solving problems dependent on that concept.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"boston-red-sox-s-dustin-pedroia-announces-retirement-from-mlb\">Boston Red Sox&rsquo;s Dustin Pedroia announces retirement from MLB</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/30816259/boston-red-sox-dustin-pedroia-announces-retirement-mlb\">Joon Lee of ESPN reports</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Boston Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia, who hasn&rsquo;t played since 2019 because of a knee injury suffered two seasons earlier, announced his retirement Monday.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Could it have ended better and I finished my career the right way? Yeah of course,&rdquo; Pedroia said on a Zoom call with the media. &ldquo;But there was a reason I was the first one dressed at 5:30 for a 7 o&rsquo;clock game. I always tell my teammates that you never know if the game is going to start early. My biggest thing in my mind was that this could be my last game and you don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s the best way I approached it from Little League on. I had the best time playing.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As a Red Sox fan, Pedroia’s retirement is no surprise. He hasn’t been physically able to play for years, since he got injured by a Manny Machado slide at second base. It is sad nonetheless. In his prime, he was fun and exciting to watch, and embodied the quality I enjoy seeing the most as a fan: “the love of the game.”</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"nyu-researchers-find-no-evidence-of-anti-conservative-bias-on-social-media\">NYU researchers find no evidence of anti-conservative bias on social media</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260269/anti-conservative-bias-social-media-no-evidence-nyu-research\">Kim Lyons reports in <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The contention that social media as an industry censors conservatives is now, as we speak, becoming part of an even broader disinformation campaign from the right, that conservatives are being silenced all across American society,” the report’s lead researcher Paul Barrett said in an interview with The Verge. “This is the obvious post-Trump theme, we’re seeing it on Fox News, hearing it from Trump lieutenants, and I think it will continue indefinitely. Rather than any of this going away with Trump leaving Washington, it’s only getting more intense.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is one of those studies that <em>may</em> help future historians sort through the mess we are living through now. It is pretty obvious to me that there is a conservative bias on social media rather than a liberal one. The shocking election in 2016 of a mendacious “conservative” social media gasbag is enough proof. That he wasn’t deplatformed until he lost the 2020 election, despite sowing devision and inciting violence on social media platforms, is further proof of it.</p>\n\n<p>I bristle now at hearing or seeing the word “conservative” describe the people running a disinformation campaign against their fellow citizens. There’s nothing “conservative” about this influential and dangerous wing of the Republican Party, which is undermining the basic traditions and institutions of society. I identify strongly as a political progressive, but I am also quite conservative in how I think that people should behave publicly and how ethically and transparently political institutions should be run.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"fullmetal-alchemist\">Fullmetal Alchemist</h1>\n\n<p>While I have been working a ton lately, I can’t work every second of the day. I have been watching the “Fullmetal Alchemist” anime series (there are two), mostly late at night, to unwind.</p>\n\n<p>I watched the entirety of “Fullmetal Alchemist”—which is the first anime adaptation of the manga—first. Because it veers widely off of the plot of the manga (which, since I am not a manga reader, I don’t care about), it seems to be widely considered the lesser of the two adaptations. I think that sells it short. There are lots of sad, thought-provoking episodes, especially toward the beginning of the run, in which characters and the audience question what it means to be human, and what is the value of a human soul. These questions build up to big ideas and set pieces by the end, which is satisfying. There are some structural problems with how the story is told—mostly in the way the timeline, pacing, and character balance shift between the beginning, middle, and end of the series—but there is no problem that majorly detracts from the series as a whole. You could quibble that a lot of the theory behind how the magic system works doesn’t make any sense, which is vital to the overall theme of the series. Consider, however, that it is a <em>magic system</em>, you have to suspend disbelief quite a bit to begin with, and of course it doesn’t make perfect sense.</p>\n\n<p>I am almost done watching the second adaptation, “Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood”, which stays true to the manga plot and is generally lauded as the better of the two anime series. At this point, I don’t think of it as “better” but it certainly is much different. The stakes in “Brotherhood” are much higher, the characters are more tightly integrated throughout the series, and the tone overall is funnier and less sad, despite the raised stakes and some (somewhat) more mature relationship elements between childhood friends/teenage-phenoms Edward and Winry. Despite these advantages, “Brotherhood” is far more cartoony in style, which I don’t prefer. It uses <em>chibi</em> (super deformed) style far more heavily than the first adaptation did, which I find distracting—the characters are often blowing their stacks in anger or are extremely embarrassed or go into some of other extreme, but emotionally and visually, that takes me out of the story a bit. That is a relatively small demerit, however, and it is offset by the increased complexity of the story.</p>\n\n<p>I am eager to see how “Brotherhood” ends, and would recommend that everyone try watching both series, especially the first one, because it is very good despite being the less-loved one.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"little-voice\">Little Voice</h1>\n\n<p>My wife and I recently discovered the Apple TV+ show “<a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/show/little-voice/umc.cmc.4x932osv992wjjdq7ce12za2r\">Little Voice</a>” and very much enjoy it.</p>\n\n<p>It is different in pace and tone from other shows (like “Curb Your Enthusiasm”) that we have been watching lately. While there is a lot going on in each episode, the pace feels slow and thoughtful, as if the show is focused mainly on the growth of its characters and on illustrating (a version of) the New York City music scene. I would not recommend watching “Little Voice” for its main plot, because it appears to follow the well-worn path of “talented-but-unknown artist slowly becomes successful.” That said, there are a ton of great character moments throughout.</p>\n\n<p>The main draw of the show is the music, most of which are songs written by series co-creator Sara Bareilles. There is a lot of music performance in each episode. All these sections look great, sound great, and are integrated completely naturally into the story. However, they serve as the primary reason why the pace is slow. If you don’t like the music, then the show will not be for you.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I think that “Little Voice” is under-rated. It didn’t blow up like “Ted Lasso” (which is, indeed, great) or “Central Park” (which is also great), but is my third-favorite Apple TV+ series thus far.</p>\n\n<p>I have been super, super, super busy today, and it just won’t stop. It looks like I’ll be working a lot of overtime&hellip;like right now. At least, once the kids go to bed, I can put my headphones back on and enjoy some music while I work.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-business-of-influenece-with-mkbhd\">The Business of Influenece with MKBHD</h1>\n\n<p>I found this <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22231657/mkbhd-marques-brownlee-interview-youtube-creator-influencer-decoder\">fairly long interview on <em>The Verge</em></a> with Marques Brownlee (<a href=\"https://youtube.com/c/mkbhd\">MKBHD on YouTube</a>) to be very interesting:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But what looks effortless and fun to the viewer is often the result of careful planning and investment. YouTubers are entrepreneurs, and Brownlee — my guest on today’s episode of Decoder — talks that talk with the best of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Marques Brownlee could be described as “tech reviewer” or a “social media influencer” or a “YouTuber.” I don’t watch all his videos, but I have checked in with his YouTube channel periodically since I first saw him (as a college student!) on an episode of TWiT. While he is telegenic and charismatic, he also presents himself as someone with a strong sense of ethics who is very smart and thoughtful about he approaches his business. This interview gives a pretty long look into Marques Brownlee’s professional world.</p>\n\n<p>My wife, who is a high school teacher, recently reported to me that one of the top “professions” that teens want to go into is “social media influencer.” That is kind of eyeroll-inducing to me, but I suppose it is as realistic and as meaningful an aspiration as “famous writer” was to me. It is important to know how much work goes into that sort of job, and how much time, investment, and infrastructure goes into keeping up with the competition.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t really want to criticize <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/news/tweetbot-6-moves-to-subscription-pricing/\">TapBots for making TweetBot version 6 a subscription app</a>.

Stop worrying about the variants until the experts let us know we have something to worry about. 2. If you are eligible for the vaccine, get it! 3. Spread the word about vaccine availability in your area. Yesterday Vermont opened signups for vaccination appointments for all Vermonters 75 and older, and I texted/emailed everyone I could think of who was over 75 or who had parents/relatives/friends who are over 75 to urge them to sign up or spread the word. 4. Continue to wear a mask (a better one if possible), wash your hands, social distance, stay home when possible, don’t spend time indoors w/ strangers, etc. Thanks to these remarkable vaccines, real relief is in sight — let’s keep on track and see this thing through.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My family is now obsessed with wearing two layers of masks, which I tried but couldn’t get to work with my glasses on. I am more interested in finally being able to buy and wear N95, KN95, and KN94 (my favorite) masks, which are more effective than the cloth masks and surgical masks I have been stuck with since February.</p>\n\n<p>In New Jersey, vaccine distribution is both successful (my wife, who is a teacher, got her first dose yesterday) and a total mess (it is very hard to get an appointment, there is no central coordination of virus distribution, and any effective effort on prioritizing inoculations for higher-risk groups is effective gone). If my family is a good indicator of people’s behavior, then lots of us New Jerseyans keep hammering away at the appointment systems, trying to get a better appointment slot, which further jams up the system.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote a support email to <a href=\"https://ulysses.app\">Ulysses</a> last week inquiring about <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">micro.blog</a> support.

We’re just waiting until we can start shooting again.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>“Barry” is a <em> sui generis</em> example of peak TV. It takes a lot of risks in terms of both plot and tone, and so far they have all paid off.

I pushed the news of it away as best I could, so I am less informed than I otherwise would be, but I am sad, angry, and ashamed nonetheless.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-rioters-incite/2021/01/06/0acfc778-5035-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html\">Per Philip Rucker in <em>The Washington Post</em></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The “American carnage” that Donald Trump vowed to end at the dawn of his presidency was revived in terrifying, treacherous form at its sunset Wednesday, as Trump made a fiery last stand and incited his supporters to storm and sack the U.S. Capitol as part of an attempted coup.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t even know how to comment on this event without seeming glib, but I feel compelled to say something anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I am, by trade, an auditor. One thing auditors are trained to investigate is called “tone at the top,” which represents the values expressed by the top management of a company which are expected from everyone who reports up to them.</p>\n\n<p>After auditing for years, I have discovered that “tone at the top” is almost everything you need to know about an organization to get an idea how well and how ethically it is operated. Ethics and decency from the top of an organization really do trickle down all the way to the bottom and permeate it entirely. Moreover, they are strongly indicative of the organization’s *solvency*—its ability to hold together as a going concern over time.</p>\n\n<p>When the “tone at the top” is selfish, vain, petty, petulant, aggrieved, unethical, amoral, and violent—as Trump’s has been—that tone trickles down to the whole organization, and pollutes the thoughts and corrupts the actions of the people within it. Unfortunately in this case, the “organization” is not just the Executive Branch, not just the federal government, and not just the Republican Party: it is the entire United States of America. What’s more, because the U.S. is a vastly influential country, the corruption and willful deceit at the head of it spills over into the rest of the world.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like I have known this from the beginning—before the slow-moving coup even started—because I understood what the “tone at the top” was, and knew that it was vitally important. <em>Knowing</em> this, sadly, is not enough, because in a democracy a majority of people need to know this for things to turn out better. Being <em>able</em> to know this, like being able to discern the “tone at the top” as a new auditor, is a rare gift. It requires a trait that is not easily acquired, but is so difficult to teach and to learn that it is often considered to be innate: <em>shrewdness</em>.</p>\n\n<p>That’s because “tone at the top” isn’t always as blatantly obvious as Trump’s vitriolic tweets and shambolic rally speeches. Understanding what the “tone at the top” <em>really</em> is, it requires a combination of healthy skepticism, decent powers of observation, and the knowledge of how things are supposed to work. You have to understand both context <em>and</em> subtext; subtext is much harder to grasp than context, but is often the more important to the two. You have to interpret people’s words <em>and</em> actions, and compare them to each other to see if the actions follow the words. You also have to have some kind of ethical foundation—which may be laws of the state, societal norms, or virtue ethics— on which to base your conclusions.</p>\n\n<p>The human mind has evolved to do a lot of this analysis automatically. Consider that establishing whether you trust another person is, and always has been, an essential part of human interaction. But, like a lot of thought processes that are largely automatic, many times mental shortcuts are taken and the wrong choice is made. To be able to second-guess these automatic thought processes takes intellect, some degree of guidance, and a willingness to think a little harder.</p>\n\n<p>I would not be surprised to learn that many of the people trying to unlawfully overturn the election—not counting the elected officials who are operating out of cynical self-interest—really do think they are making an ethical decision, and really do think they are doing the right thing. They just trusted the wrong person, or made the wrong decision about voting for or supporting, because they lack the shrewdness and imagination to discern that the “tone at the top” really does matter, and that bad words from a lazy president really will lead to riots in the streets.</p>\n\n<p>I realized today that in, ACL, a scripting language I use at work, I have been using a mixture of <code>PascalCase</code> and <code>snake_case</code> (like this: <code>Table_Name</code>) that is the worst of both worlds in terms of typing difficulty.

Here are some initial thoughts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I very much like the security and privacy features Apple Pay and the Apple Card. I try to use Apple Pay whenever I can to take advantage of most of these features, no matter what card I was using.</li>\n<li>I very much like the enhancements to the Wallet app on my iPhone to review transactions and spending.</li>\n<li>2% cash back on all Apple Pay purchases seems like a pretty good benefit to me.</li>\n<li>3% back on Apple transactions seems a little stingy, considering that Amazon and Target offer 5% back when you use their branded cards. I would get a much better cash-back rate buying an Apple product on Amazon, using my Amazon.com Visa.</li>\n<li>The interest rate offered to me was the lowest that they offer, and it is a between two and three percentage points lower than the other cards I have. I never carry a balance, so it doesn’t mean much to me.</li>\n<li>I had a false-alarm fraud alert shortly after I set it up. I made it my default on my Apple account, and a $30 annual subscription fee trigged a fraud alert. I contacted Apple Card support via iMessage, and cleared up the problem.</li>\n<li>Buying different things changes the color of the card in the Wallet app, which is amusing. The colors correspond to the spending charts.</li>\n<li>I had a lot of trouble adding the card to my Apple Watch. It took lots of fiddling with settings, but, fortunately, I did not have to unpair and repair the Apple Watch to my iPhone.</li>\n<li>The titanium card is boring and heavy. I expect to never use it. Its best feature is that my card number is not printed on it.</li>\n<li>Some common features are missing: a website, integration with personal finance applications, and joint accounts (or authorized users).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Blog post: SwiftoDo Development Notes, July 2018 <a href=\"https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/swiftodo-development-notes-july-2018/\" title=\"https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/swiftodo-develop…-notes-july-2018/\">https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/swiftodo-develop…-notes-july-2018/</a></p>\n\n<p>Blog post: <a href=\"https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/swiftodo-development-notes-july-2018/\">SwiftoDo Development Notes, July 2018</a></p>\n\n<h1 id=\"ready-player-one-by-ernest-cline\">📚 Ready Player One, by Ernest Cline</h1>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, I completed reading _<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One\">Ready Player One</a>_ by Ernest Cline. It was the first novel that I had read in a while, as I have been reading mostly nonfiction in recent years. I discovered the book from an <a href=\"https://twit.tv/shows/triangulation/episodes/322\">episode of the “Triangulation” podcast in which Leo Laporte interviewed author Andy Weir</a>, who enthusiastically recommended the book.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I enjoyed the book. The prose is efficient and the pacing is swift. I thought it started out strong, and I liked the world building and the build-up of suspense in the early chapters. After a while, though, I tired of all the 1980s video game and movie references, and wanted the book to end. While I was about three quarters through the book, I referred to it as “the reading equivalent to watching somebody else play video games”. For me, the stakes felt too low, and the characterizations were too thin, to make a lasting impression. Still, I had fun reading it, at least most of the way through.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"introducing-the-new-yorker-crossword-puzzle\">Introducing The New Yorker Crossword Puzzle</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/crossword/puzzles-dept/2018/04/30\">The New Yorker just launched a crossword puzzle</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most of our readers have e-mail addresses now, and the Web has given us the space to try new things—and to try old things again. In that spirit, we’re launching another crossword, online this time, and in the American style. It’ll be weekly, just like the magazine: a new one every Monday morning</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am a daily crossword puzzle player. I enjoy them, though I am not terribly good at them, because I love word games and have read that crosswords help keep your mind sharp into old age.</p>\n\n<p>The New Yorker puzzle is a <em>tiny</em> bit more challenging than I would like (as I said, I’m not a strong player), but I’m happy there’s another source of crossword puzzles (beyond the New York Times, which I also subscribe to) coming may way.</p>\n\n<p>I hope they will someday move it into their iOS app. The scrolling behavior, which affects the on-page keyboard, is annoying on mobile.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"prolific-apple-supply-chain-analyst-ming-chi-kuo-departs-kgi-securities-likely-to-focus-on-companies-other-than-apple\">Prolific Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo departs KGI Securities, likely to focus on companies other than Apple</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/30/prolific-apple-supply-chain-analyst-ming-chi-kuo-departs-kgi/\">Kuo’s departure</a> comes hot off the heels of <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/13/apple-memo-on-leaks-leaks/\">Apple’s recent “leaked” memo</a> about leaking that threatened the leaky leaders who leak.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why has Ming-Chi Kuo, arguably one of the most popular technology analysts in the world, decided to move on? One possible reason is that his sources have done likewise, or perhaps have even been removed in light of Apple’s recent memo and strong stance against leaks — supply chain or otherwise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wondered why myself, and figured that Apple has either threatened him, or his sources, with criminal lawsuits. I, for one, wouldn’t mind if Apple finally closed up all the leaks in its supply chain. While these leaks may benefit Apple investors, they don’t really benefit Apple fans that much.</p>\n\n<p>Blog post: <a href=\"https://mjdescy.me/2018/04/28/swiftodo-development-notes-april-2018/\">SwiftoDo Development Notes, April 2018</a></p>\n\n<h1 id=\"how-we-got-to-now\">How We Got To Now</h1>\n\n<p>I recently finished reading Steen Johnson’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/books/review/how-we-got-to-now-by-steven-johnson.html\">How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World</a>. It was a breezy and pleasurable read, full of interesting information. Johnson’s writing is clear, concise, and engaging throughout.</p>\n\n<p>As a huge nerd who spent a lot of time in childhood perusing a science and technology encyclopedia, and a lot of time in my teens watching tech-related documentaries on Discovery and TLC (before those networks drifted to reality TV), I already knew a lot of the material. Still, it’s a wonderful read to anyone who loves the “history of ideas course” way of looking at disparate, seemingly unrelated things in everyday life, and drawing a through line that connects them all. Plus I learned new phrases that describe these unintended and intended technological and cultural developments—“hummingbird effects” and “the adjacent possible”—that I particularly like.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"i-miss-caesar-salad\">I miss Caesar salad</h1>\n\n<p>It seems to me that massive outbreaks of food borne illness are becoming more and more common. That <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-outbreak-worsens-98-people-now-sick-n869681\">our current, worsening outbreak</a> is the <em>second</em> E. Coli outbreak tied to my favorite type of lettuce in the past six months or so, and it is so virulent, is making me feel worried about our food system, and pessimistic about my country’s will to improve it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>An outbreak of E. coli food poisoning linked to romaine lettuce has widened and has now made at least 98 people sick, federal health officials said Friday.</p>\n\n<p>More than half have had to be hospitalized because the strain of E. coli causing this outbreak is an especially nasty one, the officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said.</p>\n\n<p>People in 22 states have reported E. coli infections linked to the outbreak, the CDC and FDA said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m no expert in this, but I feel like we have several problems in our food system that have, in the past few decades, started to compound in dangerous ways that we should have seen coming. Some of these problems include overcrowding of animals, overuse of antibiotics in livestock, and over-concentration in production and processing. When bad hygiene infects food, it’s worse now than it used to be. The bacteria are more resistant to antibiotics, and the food, and food borne illness, is distributed all across the country.</p>\n\n<p>Another annoyance to me, as a someone who has eaten some raw eggs (usually in cookie dough or homemade eggnog) and rare meat over the years, is that I have <em>never</em> gotten a food borne illness from those activities. I have, however, gotten terribly ill several times from eating restaurant salads, probably due to unwashed hands or vegetables. There are menu warnings about undercooked meat in every restaurant I go to, but none about the danger of eating unwashed vegetables.</p>\n\n<p>I am impatiently awaiting the day I can eat Caesar salads again.</p>\n\n<p>While I was on vacation, I wrote a series of blog posts about all my old speaker systems.

				"content_text": "A software update at work pushed out the virtual backgrounds feature for WebEx. Since my home office—at least the part of it that is _behind_ me and not under my control— is a mess, I enabled it. \n\nSadly, it looks pretty awful. The background mostly leaves a halo around me un-obscured; sometimes it clips portions of my face or shoulder off. I have a very high-end laptop and a “very good” Logitech webcam (all webcams are terrible, I think), so I have concluded that WebEx’s technology is way behind Zoom’s, which does the virtual backgrounds flawlessly. I think I will leave virtual backgrounds on, for privacy reasons, and hope no one minds the weird visual side effects.\n\n\nI did not have to wait long for the [Apple Music announcement](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/) to drop.\n\n\nApple Music can release its [rumored lossless tier](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439885/apple-music-tease-hi-fi-lossless-music-streaming) any minute now. I’m waiting with my best headphones. I don’t care at all about spatial audio or Dolby Atmos, though, so I hope that isn’t the only kind of thing coming.\n\n\n# Apple is Poised to Lose its Antitrust Battle\nI think that Apple is going to lose whatever antitrust cases are eventually brought against it in the EU and in the US. I don’t actually think Apple _should_ lose, because I don’t think it is correct to call Apple a monopoly.\n\nThe general antitrust argument against Apple is that its App Store platform is too locked down, and that is unfair because Apple is a monopoly (insert eye roll here) of its own platform. App is a platform owner. Of course it has a “monopoly” over the platform it owns. That doesn’t make it a monopoly in the overall marketplace. Moreover, while iOS is undoubtedly popular, it is a _minority_ smartphone platform, which in the broadest legal terms that I understand, makes monopoly-related antitrust law not apply to them.\n\nApp developers have to accept Apple’s terms, and pay a pretty large commission to Apple, to distribute apps in the store or to take in-app purchases. That may not feel fair to developers, but I can’t take seriously the arguments that it is illegal. It is the same way that game consoles work. Will we go after Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft next? Shouldn’t they open up their game consoles to alternative payment systems and alternate app stores, too? I have heard of no one seriously arguing this.\n\nThe most compelling argument against Apple’s App Store requirements is that Apple demands too much money from developers for distribution and payment solutions that other companies now offer at lower prices. I am sympathetic to this argument because I too think Apple should have lowered its commission over the years, as marginal costs for these technologies and services have declined. However, the size of Apple’s cut is not really at issue here. Apple, rather clumsily, lowered its commission for a majority of its developers to 15%, starting in January 2021, but the antitrust talk just keeps rolling on.\n\nThe second most compelling argument against Apple is that it uses its platform-owner advantage to position its own software and services over third-party competitors. Again, I sympathize. Apple Sherlocks developers sometimes, and can position its own software and services over anyone else’s. So does Microsoft (ever use Windows?). Amazon exercises a tremendous advantage over third party sellers in its online marketplace.\n\nI could argue that even Linux vendors, such as Ubuntu, position their own, preferred software over that of third-party developers. Software platform owners always have advantages over third parties that operate on their platform. Extracting as much value from that as is possible is the entire point of creating and owning a platform. I think it only becomes an antitrust problem when a company has majority market share, which Apple does not have.\n\nIf developers can’t accept Apple’s terms, then they shouldn’t. They should develop for Android instead, which has the majority market share anyway, or create progressive web apps. (Remember, the web is an app platform, too, not just a way to collect credit card payments for software.) If developers “need” to develop for iOS because iOS users, on average, spend way more money on apps than Android users, then that just shows the value Apple’s marketplace has, and _is_ worth paying for.\n\nDespite my views, I still think Apple is poised to lose any legal actions about them regarding monopoly. It won’t lose based on the merits of whatever case is brought against it; it will lose because enough political sentiment is against Apple, at least in this area, and that is all that matters. Perhaps all the tech giants will fall under this scrutiny, and all will be forced to open up their platforms more widely, and will be forced to renounce their first-party advantage when distributing applications and features. I just don’t see that actually happening, and if it does happen, I don’t think it will benefit anybody in the way government regulators would expect. It could even stifle the development of the next generation of technology platforms.\n\n\n# Is a higher-quality Apple Music tier on the way?\n[I hope so.](https://sixcolors.com/link/2021/05/is-a-higher-quality-apple-music-tier-on-the-way/) I am a sucker for lossless codecs, even though I probably can’t hear the difference between them and AAC-256.\n\n\nI have been using SQL for 25 years and I just learned today that `SELECT [...] FROM Table1, Table2` is called a “[cross join](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-basics/sql-server-cross-join/)” an can also be expressed as `SELECT [...] FROM Table1 CROSS JOIN Table2`. 🤦 In my defense, I must say that I have only had to use a cross join a few times in my entire career.\n\n\nI unblocked Reddit.com earlier this week because the domain keeps coming up in tech question-related search results. After only a few days, I’m back looking at mechanical keyboards and expensive headphones on Reddit like an addict. I just blocked the domain again.\n\n\n# ⌨️ Durgod Zeus Engine Upgrade\nTo my complete surprise, I discovered today that Durgod released an update to their keyboard configuration: Durgod Zeus Engine. The interface looks a lot better, and it is a little easier to use. They didn’t change the keyboard hardware driver to support function layers, which is unfortunately. I really want that. (Honestly, what I want is the ObinsKit software that powers the Anne Pro 2 to apply work on it.)\n\nI set up a new RGB color scheme and remapped my CapsLock to Control, saved them to the keyboard’s local profile, and (out of habit) configured the Zeus Engine to _not_ start every time I log on. I plugged my keyboard into my USB hub and will keep my fingers crossed that it will work reliably now.\n\n\n# Report: Apple’s M2 chips may launch as soon as July 2021\n[Napier Lopez reports in _The Next Web_](https://thenextweb.com/news/report-apples-m2-chips-may-launch-as-soon-as-july-2021):\n\n> Apple only just released its new iMacs featuring the acclaimed M1 ARM-based processor, but according to a report from Nikkei, the company plans to launch M2 as soon as July.\n\nI don’t know anything in particular about Apple’s plans, but it seems crazy to me to expect a faster chip at this time. What I would expect is more I/O, driven by more cores and supported by more RAM. Of course, I could be wrong. Maybe Apple can overvolt the M1 to get more speed out of it, and will call it by another name.\n\n\nI am very conservative about cities re-opening too soon, considering the pandemic has not ended. But [NYC reopening on July 1](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/29/new-york-city-mayor-bill-de-blasio-says-the-city-will-re-open-100percent-on-july-1.html) almost seems reasonable to me. Time will tell.\n\n\n🎵 I’m going to lean into my New Jersey-ness today and listen to a ton of Bruce Springsteen. First album up: [_The Wild, The Innocent, & the E Street Shuffle_](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-wild-the-innocent-the-e-street-shuffle/186149850). This is one of Springsteen’s records that I never think to listen to, but, of course, it’s great. It was made back when Springsteen still wrote songs with a torrent of stream-of-consciousness-style lyrics like a verbose street poet.\n\n\n# Microsoft is changing the default Office font and wants your help to pick a new one\n[Per Tom Warren In _The Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407297/microsoft-office-new-default-font-2022):\n\n> Microsoft is changing its default Office font next year and wants everyone to help pick the new default. While there are more than 700 font options in Word, Microsoft has commissioned five new custom fonts for Office, in a move away from the Calibri font that has been the default in Microsoft Office for nearly 15 years.\n\nI am unusually attached to Calibri so I am not looking forward to this change. Then again, at work I often have to publish using Arial Narrow, which I think is objectively awful in terms of aesthetics and legibility, so it probably won’t affect me too much.\n\n\n# Amazon Vine Review: PomeloHome Bread Knife | 8\" Serrated Stainless Steel Bread Knife | German High Carbon Steel Serrated Knife\n## 4 Stars\n### Looks great, but I don’t love the shape of the handle\nOverall, this bread knife is pretty good, but its straight shape provides poor knuckle clearance, which makes cutting loaves with hard bottom crusts more difficult than it should be. A curved or tapered blade is a better design.\n\nThe coolest thing about this knife is that it is one piece of metal from tip to handle. That is appealing to me in terms of durability, especially because I am in the middle of getting rid of a set of knives from another brand because their handles are falling apart.\n\nI could not tell it from the product photos, but the shape of the handle is roughly triangular: it is slimmer at the bottom than at the top. It looks cool in photos, but it isn’t the best ergonomically for me because there is a less surface area than I am used to to grip on the bottom of the knife.\n\nThe blade is made of high-carbon steel, which is exactly what you want in a kitchen knife because it promises to retain sharpness for a long time.\n\n\n# The Sequence 🎮\nYesterday I decided to re-play a game I loved a few years ago called _[[The Sequence]](http://ombgames.com/?p=121)_. It is a puzzle game where you, essentially, build a machine with various component parts to move a ball (well, the game calls it a “binary cell”) from one part of the screen to another. It sounds simple, and it starts out fairly simple, but it becomes very challenging as you progress. It’s the sort of game a programmer, or anyone who enjoyed _[Human Resource Machine](https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine)_ would enjoy.\n\n\n# Fez 🎮\nI am delighted that I discovered a video game that is [new to the Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/fez-switch/), but not at all new to the world, called [Fez](http://www.fezgame.com). This is the game’s official blurb:\n\n> Gomez is a 2D creature living in a 2D world. Or is he? When the existence of a mysterious 3rd dimension is revealed to him, Gomez is sent out on a journey that will take him to the very end of time and space. Use your ability to navigate 3D structures from 4 distinct classic 2D perspectives.\n\nIt is a 2D puzzle platformer where your character can rotate the environment left or right 90 degrees at a time, but you always interact with the environment in two dimensions. Some of the puzzles are quite challenging, but I think that the most hidden secrets that you can get from solving the hardest puzzles are all optional to completing the game. It’s a charming game, and easily my favorite Switch game of this year so far.\n\n\n# The shooting likely lasted one or two minutes.\nI am unsettled today by [yet another mass shooting](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/16/us/indianapolis-fedex-shooting#the-attack-is-the-latest-in-a-recent-series-of-mass-shootings-in-the-us) in my country. It seems like not a day goes by without a _New York Times_ news alert about it. (I plan to turn those alerts off after I finish writing this.) This time, a gunman killed seven people, then himself. This detail about the story jumped out at me: “[The shooting likely lasted one or two minutes](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/16/us/indianapolis-fedex-shooting#shooting-at-a-fedex-warehouse-in-indianapolis-leaves-8-dead).”\n\nI think the news media covers mass shootings like they are exciting, like some kind of action movie where bad outcomes only happen to the extras, and the rest of us get to watch. But “one or two minutes” isn’t an action movie. It isn’t something exciting. It’s actually, really, really stupid. That such a thing is even possible, outside a war, is embarrassing and shameful to all of us. I wish it were more widely considered to be.\n\n\n# iPhone 13 mini could be the last 'mini' iPhone, says Kuo\nStephen Warwick reports in _iMore_: \n\n> Kuo says that next year Apple will drop the 5.4-inch model and run with two 6.1-inch models instead, one Pro, one regular.\n\nThis rumor is a prime reason I upgraded to the iPhone 12 mini early this year. I absolutely love the size and weight of it. It fits better in my hands and in my pockets than my iPhone 7 Plus ever did. However, the 12 mini’s small screen size makes it less compelling to read on, edit photos on, or watch videos on. These are all things I do pretty much every day without complaint, but if it were going to be my only portable device I would have bought one with a bigger screen.\n\nI have no desire to go back to a larger phone, because the phone, for me, is one tool among many, rather than the center of my computing universe. It doesn’t have to be compelling, just useful. It doesn’t have to be used constantly, just when it makes the most sense to. \n\nSome time from now, I think the smartphone, as a thing I carry around all the time, and as the default “Internet communication device,” is going to disappear and be replaced by something else: smart glasses maybe, or some kind of earpiece (when I am really old and need hearing aides).\n\n\n# My First NuGet Package\nLast night, I published my first [NuGet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/what-is-nuget) package: [TodoTxt.Library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TodoTxt.Library/1.0.0). It is a code library meant to help develop [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org) applications in [.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework). \n\nI wrote the code back in 2015, [open-sourced it on GitHub](https://github.com/mjdescy/TodoTxt.Library), but otherwise left it alone because I had moved on to more macOS and iOS development by that time. This week, I upgraded the code base work on .NET 5, so that it is cross platform (rather than Windows-only, as was my original version), and figured out how to package it and upload it to NuGet, where it may have a shot at actually being used.\n\n\n# Microsoft announces Surface Laptop 4 with choice of Intel or AMD processors\nTom Warren’s article on _The Verge_ caught my eye:\n\n> Microsoft is refreshing its Surface lineup with the Surface Laptop 4 today, which now offers the choice between AMD or Intel processors across both the 13.5- and 15-inch models. Both sizes will ship with Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors or AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series processors. Microsoft is shipping its Surface Laptop 4 on April 15th in the US, Canada, and Japan, starting at $999 for the AMD model and $1,299 for the Intel version — a $300 price gap between the pair.\n\nIf I was more of a Windows guy I would probably buy only Microsoft-brand laptops at this point. They don’t always have the best specs, but I like their designs a lot.\n\nI spend most of my computing time using Windows for work. I try to forget that I have a Lenovo laptop by putting it behind a giant monitor and using an external keyboard and trackball to operate it. Lenovo laptops are good, I guess, as long as I don’t have to touch them. I don’t like their keyboards (both in terms of layout and feel) or the pointing devices (the trackpad is too small, and I’m done with using the trackpoint/eraserhead thing). The Surface Laptops keyboards and trackpads have always seemed a lot more sensible to me in how they are designed.\n\n\n# Siri Reveals Apple Event Planned for Tuesday, April 20\nI’m assuming that somebody’s job, every day, is to wake up in the morning and ask Siri “[When is the next Apple Event](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/13/siri-apple-event-tuesday-april-20/)?” I’m glad I didn’t try to change careers back in 2009 or 2011 (when I thought of it) and get into tech journalism.\n\n\nI never would have predicted that in 2021 I would be using [a text-mode file manager from the 1990s](https://farmanager.com), a [command-line based to-do list program](https://github.com/VladimirMarkelov/ttdl), and, at least sometimes (by choice!), the [Vim](https://www.vim.org) text editor.\n\n\nTonight I published a huge update to the website for my first iOS app: [SwiftoDo](https://swiftodoapp.com). What was once a one page site with a very outdated template is now a Hugo-based site full of information. There is a lot more that I could add, it is now so much better than my old site I had to publish it.\n\n\n# James Hoffman’s AeroPress video\nLast year when I was looking for something soothing to watch on YouTube, I came across James Hoffmann’s many videos about coffee, coffee machines, coffee products, and so on. I have watched a ton of them, mostly because I like his voice and demeanor. [His latest video](https://youtu.be/aidvrssMSGo) is about the [AeroPress](https://aeropress.com), which I have used for many, many years. I actually learned something new from it: People use the funnel, which is meant to help put your coffee grounds into the press without making a mess, to brew coffee into cups with mouths too small for the bottom of the AeroPress. I have to try that! He also states in the video that the AeroPress is easy to make good coffee from, but is difficult to master. I actually put very little effort into my AeroPress use—far less than I used to when I first starting using it. I have found that my AeroPress brewing technique, no matter how sloppy or lazy, doesn’t seem to affect my coffee all that much. It prefer not stressing about it anymore.\n\n\n# Linux on the M1 Mac Mini\nThe Linux kernel is [gaining Apple M1 support](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/soc/soc.git/commit/?h=for-next&id=0d5fe4b31785b732b71e764b55cda5c8d6e3bbbf). I have been wondering if, years from now, I can move my M1 Mac Mini to a home app-server role, running Linux, when it gets too old for Xcode and stops getting macOS updates. I have a Celeron based PC doing that for me now, but it runs hot and can be noisy, too. If a machine can run Linux, it extends its lifespan considerably for me.\n\n\n# My (first) failed attempt to flash QMK on my mechanical keyboard\nI wasted an hour last night trying to install [QMK firmware](https://qmk.fm) on my work computer’s mechanical keyboard, a [Durgod Taurus K320](https://www.durgod.com/page9?product_id=47&_l=en). I have a love/hate relationship with it. I love that it has the best build quality, rigidity, stabilization, keycaps, and typing feel and sound of any of the many (many!) keyboards I have owned over the years. I hate that its software is buggy: so buggy that sometimes the keyboard hangs and I have to unplug it to fix it; so buggy that I have to plug it in directly to my laptop rather than through a USB hub; so buggy that that I cannot program its layers the way I want to.\n\nVery recently, someone figured out how to run QMK firmware on it, which could resolve the stability and customizability problems I have with the board. Unfortunately, I was not able to figure out how to flash the firmware to the keyboard. The main problem I faced was that the keyboard was not recognized by the QMK Toolkit software (on Windows) even after I put the keyboard into bootloader mode, and even after I started messing with the bootloader firmware using [Zadig](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/guides/driver_installation_zadig).\n\nAfter lots of tries, I couldn’t figure out. I think I dodged a bullet, though, because I’m not sure QMK can control the RGB backlighting, which, on this keyboard, is necessary to see the key legends. Fortunately, despite me trying to mess with it, my keyboard still works as well as it did before. It’s not perfect, and I really would like to create a more robust `Fn` (function key) layer, but I will live with it for now.\n\n\n🎵 I’m listening to [_Gaslighter_ by The Chicks](https://music.apple.com/us/album/for-her/1499733036?i=1499733045) again today. It is one of my favorite albums of 2020. Everything is great about it, from the catchy choruses to the close harmonies to the clean production. My favorite part of it is the songwriting, which is fueled with righteous anger and makes for compelling country-pop music.\n\n\nToday I made the mistake to look up someone I knew while I was in high school. I was reading an article about illegal drugs, and thought about a high school friend’s younger brother who ran into some drug problems about 20 years ago. Sadly, I discovered that he died last year. I can only conjecture, but it seems, based on what else happened to him over the past few years, that drug problems led to his premature death. Learning about what happened to him made me very sad.\n\n\n# Apple Arcade just got a huge update of new games, including some mobile classics\n[As reported by Andrew Webster in _The Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362388/apple-arcade-game-subscription-update-monument-valley-threes-iphone-ipad):\n\n> Apple’s gaming subscription service just got a massive influx of new titles. The headliner is Fantasian — the latest release from the creator of Final Fantasy — which is joined by other titles like new versions of NBA 2K and The Oregon Trail, and World of Demons from PlatinumGames. As part of the update, the service is getting two new categories of games: Apple calls them “Timeless Classics” and “App Store Greats.”\n\nI literally just canceled my (second) Apple Arcade free trial twelve hours before this announcement. I just can’t seem to get into Apple Arcade at all. For the most part, the reason is that I find my iPhone 12 mini to be too small to be a compelling gaming device. Secondarily, I don’t want to get into a complex, involved game on my iPhone or iPad. I prefer my mobile games to be simple things that can be jumped into and out of, more like the “Timeless Classics” that Apple is now adding to Apple Arcade. It’s too bad for Apple Arcade that I already own almost all of those games.\n\n\n# Fully vaccinated people may travel, CDC says\nAs reported by Lena H. Sun and Lori Aratani in _The Washington Post_:\n\n> Federal health officials gave the green light Friday for fully vaccinated people to resume travel as an estimated 100 million Americans have had at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine, and evidence mounts of the shots’ effectiveness.\n\nThat’s good news, but it doesn’t make me want to go out and travel by plane or train anytime soon.\n\nI am fully vaccinated, but my kids are not (because, of course, there is no approved vaccine for children yet), and that dramatically limits my desire to travel, eat in indoor restaurants, or do any indoor activities in public unless they are absolutely necessary. I understand that it is probably quite safe for me to do some of these activities (provided I wear a mask, etc.), but it seems to me that doing so would still be (even more) uncomfortable and unpleasant (than it was before). \n\nMy wife and I have been talking every day about what is OK or not OK for us to do now that we are vaccinated. Despite both being vaccinated, we are still not comfortable dining in restaurants or staying in hotels (don’t even talk about flying!), but we have realized that we are way behind our friends and acquaintances in terms of risk taking. We remain concerned about our children being explored to the virus, and about the rising and “extremely high” (per _The New York Times_) COVID-19 risk level our county is currently at. It just doesn’t make sense for us to change our behavior that much yet—at least not until the local COVID infection numbers go down quite a bit, which won’t happen until after a lot more people get vaccinated.\n\n\n⚾️ For the first time in over a year I have a baseball game on in the background as I work. I hope to get by the with MLB “free game of the day” offering this year, rather than paying to subscribe to the season package. There was no free game for the season opener yesterday, though, so I’m watching a spring training game.\n\n\n# OpenAI’s text-generating system GPT-3 is now spewing out 4.5 billion words a day\n[James Vincent reports in _The Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356180/openai-gpt-3-text-generation-words-day):\n\n> The best-known AI text-generator is OpenAI’s GPT-3, which the company recently announced is now being used in more than 300 different apps, by “tens of thousands” of developers, and producing 4.5 billion words per day. That’s a lot of robot verbiage. This may be an arbitrary milestone for OpenAI to celebrate, but it’s also a useful indicator of the growing scale, impact, and commercial potential of AI text generation.\n\nThe obvious industry target for auto-text is journalism. It is already being used there for sports reporting, and could probably be used for local government reporting too. There are other areas it will encroach on that are news-adjacent (think financial news or business book digest services like Blinkist), like education and entertainment.\n\nI’m an auditor, and I think that, eventually, auto-text is going to destroy about 50% of our billable hours. Auditors spend a *ton* of time writing. We document our procedures. We record our work. We summarize our findings. We write reports for our clients. Making sense of all the work, both for our own understanding and for our client’s, for the sake of writing it down, takes a lot of time. Moreover, the simple act of typing it out and, especially, hyperlinking everything together so we support our conclusions, requires a lot of manual work. Some of this work is communicative, but a lot of it (like the hyperlinking part) is mechanical. Consequently, much of it is ripe for automation.\n\nI think, though, that transforming this laborious and time-consuming writing process into something auto-generated by a bot would produce a lot more *information* but a lot less *knowledge* than we had before. You gain a lot more understanding how a company, business process, or control works by writing about it than by reading about it. Why? Because writing is *thinking*. To write well is mentally strenuous. It requires you to think how you would communicate an idea to someone else, notably someone else with a different perspective and different knowledge than you have. At the end of the writing process, you should understand your subject backwards and forwards and from all sides; you could probably describe it in a number of different ways; and you will likely remember the gist of it, and specific nuances about it, for far longer than you would if you had just read about it in a report.\n\nThe world won’t end, and few will shed tears, when AI writes audit reports and work papers. Audits cost money, and businesses mostly don’t think they benefit from them. If it makes the auditors less knowledgeable, however, side effects will develop, and those will be long-lasting. Knowledgable auditors help make good control environments possible, which leads to more stable and more solvent companies. Decreasing the understanding of auditors could make systems and processes more unstable and less trustworthy over time. Additionally, knowledgable auditors often move to the business side and go on to manage well-controlled organizations. While the auditor-to-manager career path will likely continue, such moves would not result in the same level of management quality if the auditors don’t have to think as deeply about what they are auditing as they did before the AI text-bots took over. Neither of these side effects bodes particularly well for the people the auditors and the audited companies (and their fancy AI) serve.\n\n\n# There is no perfect template—just pick one\nI stayed up late last night drafting a new, Hugo-driven version of one of my websites. I went from having nothing at all built to having about one third of the site done in a couple hours. The result, I think, will be more plain (and maybe more ugly) than the existing site, but it will be less janky on mobile devices.\n\nI sank a lot of time over the past week looking for a Hugo theme that is perfect for my needs, but I couldn’t find one. For the sake of achieving my simple goal of refreshing my tiny websites, I gave up the goal of visual perfection, and am driving forward with a theme that I think is OK that works well enough for me.\n\nFrom my perspective, I want my site to be easier to maintain and add content. That is more important to me than having a site that looks really slick. My old websites don’t look slick anymore, anyway: No one is fooled by outdated HTML templates into thinking that my very niche apps are developed by a huge, sophisticated software corporation.\n\n\n# The organizational rabbit hole\nThis is a short, short version of what happened to me over the past week when I decided to get organized.\n\n1. Form a desire to organize my project files differently.\n2. Discover the [Johnny Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com) system.\n3. Create a taxonomy for my files in a text file.\n4. Start writing PowerShell script to switch folders based on the Johnny Decimal number\n5. Start writing a PowerShell script to index all the Johnny Decimal numbers in my folder tree\n6. Think about working with files from the command line more often\n7. Install [Midnight Commander](https://midnight-commander.org) for a command line file manager\n8. Learn a lot of Midnight Commander shortcuts and customizations\n9. Learn about [Far Manager](https://farmanager.com), which is a lot like Midnight Commander but works much better on Windows\n10. Run into keyboard shortcut conflicts with Windows Terminal\n11. Learn about assigning and removing keyboard shortcuts in Windows Terminal\n12. Start thinking about using [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org) from the Windows Terminal, because my [TaskPaper](https://www.taskpaper.com) file has been too big for months and is awful to work with\n13. Tried to find a todo.txt command line app for Windows that works on my machine \n14. Thought about writing my own todo.txt command line app using an old C# library I created\n\nAnd...I still haven’t organized anything yet. 😅\n\n\n# The Falcon and the Winter Soldier 📺\nI watched episode one of [_The Falcon and the Winter Soldier_](https://www.marvel.com/tv-shows/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier/1) this week. It’s a show about two [MCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) characters I don’t particularly care that much about, so it wasn’t something I was really looking forward to, but I pay for Disney+ anyway and thought I may as well check it out. Reader, I liked it!\n\nMy first impression is that it looks like it cost a zillion dollars. Special-effects-wise, it looks on par with the Marvel movies. Based on that alone, I could see why Disney originally wanted it to premiere first, before _WandaVision_ and whatever other Marvel shows are being developed.\n\nMy second impression is that I appreciated that it was trying to tell a Black story as well as a super hero story. I am not optimistic that Sam’s (The Falcon’s) family side story is going to be anything but predictable, but it is nice to see an attempt to give the character some grounding in reality. Race is an issue that touches everything in American life, unfortunately. In some ways, it would be disrespectful to Sam’s character and to the audience not to address that in some way.\n\nI don’t have anything bad to say about the Winter Soldier part of the show, but it isn’t as interesting to me. I expect it to follow a predictable “antihero almost, but doesn’t quite, make good” formula, but maybe the writers will surprise me. \n\nPredictability aside, I’m just glad to have something new and fun to watch.\n\n\n# The menu key\nI was thinking about creating a training presentation to help my coworkers with keyboards shortcuts, but was dismayed to see that our Lenovo laptop keyboards (which I never use, because I work from home and use external peripherals) don’t even have a menu key. Someone decided that `Print Screen` was more important, which may even be true, but it doesn’t help me make a good presentation for my coworkers. The menu key alternative, `Shift+F10` is going to be a very hard sell, especially because `F10` on the laptop requires the `Fn` key to be pressed, too.\n\nI have gone from someone who did not use the [menu key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_key) on my keyboard for 20+ years (since it was invented in the 1990s) to someone who can’t live without it (on my Windows at least). I made it a point to start using it a few months ago, and now I use it constantly. I recommend that all Windows users with an ANSI or ISO keyboard layout check it out. That key is positioned right underneath your thumb when you use the arrow keys.\n\n\n🎵 “[Canada’s Country](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/canadas-country/pl.f2da318b2e1a4f358f10efc2021cba6e)”: I’ve been enjoying this laid-back playlist while I work. Honestly, I didn’t know Canada made country music. Unfortunately, there’s nothing particularly _Canadian_ about it. It would be cool if there were.\n\n\nPeople on LinkedIn still use a lot of #hashtags non-ironically. Who are they tagging content for?\n\n\n# Zach Snyder’s *Justice League*\nI was not I initially interested at all in the [Snyder Cut of _Justice League_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Snyder%27s_Justice_League) but I ended up watching it anyway, over two nights. I’m glad I did.\n\nI thought the theatrical release of _Justice League_ was pretty bad, but not quite as bad as the professional movie review consensus was. I figured that the Snyder cut must be better, but I was surprised at how much better it is. Granted, it still isn’t _good_. It doesn’t fix its pacing problems. It still is not as brisk and pleasurable as the best of the Marvel movies. It doesn’t tell a cohesive story, but it also crams in too many story lines for a non-DC fan to keep track of. It still has some dumb script problems, such every single part of the nonsensical museum height/terrorist bombing blot in the opening Wonder Woman scene, that could have been solved by editing a few sentences of dialog. While not exactly *good*, it is a good bad movie now. Its reach often exceeds its grasp, but it offers a lot of interesting material to people who are already fans. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to be the kind of movie that would bring a lot new fans in.\n\nIt is now very clear to me that Zach Snyder’s vision was dark and wild and weird—definitely too much of all of those things to launch a successful franchise—but Joss Whedon’s contributions were just awful: tasteless, asinine, nonsensical, and insulting to the audience. Whedon’s dialog (notably Superman’s and The Flash’s) and the character moments he created, like the race between The Flash and Superman, are embarrassing to watch and make the characters seem stupid. Snyder’s cut simply had better dialog for them. Simply getting rid of the random _people_ that Whedon put into that nuclear wasteland Russian city—the one that existed in the movie only to be destroyed in a bout of cinematic excess—made the climax bearable. Who needs to worry about a family who shouldn’t be living in a nuclear wasteland anyway when the entire world is already at stake? Whedon really did screw up that movie. \n\nI think that the Snyder Cut works very well for fans of the comics, especially fans of the “what-if” versions of all the famous characters. Some fans, like me, believe that comic book characters are archetypes, and really can be _anything_, and no representation of them is truly canonical. The grim, dark version of the Justice League is an interesting thought experiment, one of many worth exploring. It is not something I ever felt hung up on as “not the real version” of Superman or whatever. The Snyder Cut isn’t the real version of the DC Universe to me, because nothing is. It’s all just ideas and entertainment anyway.\n\n\n# Alt+F4\nI have been using [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com) for many years, and I never thought until today to map `Windows+Q` to quit the active app and close the active window. That creates something very similar to Mac’s `Command+Q` shortcut to Windows.\n\nThe default Windows keyboard shortcut for quitting an app is `Alt+F4`, which is a two hand operation for me. Note that in AutoHotKey, you don’t even need to send that key command; you can use the WinClose function instead:\n\n#q::\nWinClose, A\nReturn\n\nOne of the best things Apple has ever done with their support of keyboard shortcuts was to pretend that function keys (`F1` through `F12`) don’t exist.\n\n\n# Intel invests $20 billion into new factories, will produce chips for other companies\n[Chiam Gartenberg reports in *The Verge*](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing):\n\n> At the company’s “Engineering the Future” announcement today, Gelsinger announced plans to outsource more of Intel’s chip production to third-party foundries; a $20 billion investment into two new fabs in Arizona; and a new branch of the company called Intel Foundry Services, which will see Intel’s foundries produce chips for other companies.\n\nIntel has had an awful decade, having missed out on smartphone chips and having stalled out at their 14nm process for years. Still, it is a strategically important company for my country, and I have to ill will toward it, even if I don’t prefer their products right now. I would love to see them become competitive again.\n\nThe idea of Intel fabbing chips for other companies is a big deal. Intel has never done that before. It seems to me like it could be the first step of spinning off that part of the business into its own company, and focusing on process shrinks in ways that the fully integrated Intel could not before.\n\n\n# Seven mass shootings in seven days\nJosh Berlinger of _CNN_ reports today that [the Colorado attack is the 7th mass shooting in 7 days in the US](http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_d3f4ea80ea0d81acb5d30fcf939c3243). \n\nIt seemed like there were periods in recent years in which we had a deadly mass shooting in the national news at least every week, if not several times each week. There has been something of a pause due to COVID, for understandable reasons. Unfortunately, we seem to be un-pausing now. Sadly, mass shooting rates in the U.S. seem to be getting back to normal. \n\nBut what is “normal?” It is actually hard to know what is normal for gun violence in the U.S. Here’s an interesting factoid from the article about my country’s gun problem:\n\n> It's unclear how this number of mass shootings compares to an average week in the US.\n> \n> Though some official gun violence data is available, the US federal government does not have a centralized system or database to track firearm incidents and mass shootings nationwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks some gun violence data, nearly 40,000 people were killed in incidents involving firearms in 2019.\n\nThe article omits the reason for this: There are actually [laws against government agencies, such as the CDC, accurately tracking gun violence](https://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-government-study-gun-violence/story?id=50300379). That’s just stupid and self-defeating. While dying due to gun violence is incredibly unlikely, statistically speaking, it is also completely unnecessary. We should treat [all gun deaths](https://usafacts.org/data/topics/security-safety/crime-and-justice/firearms/firearm-deaths/) as *preventable* and *unacceptable*. Only then can we have the mental and moral clarity to do something about it.\n\n\n# Ulysses and Micro.blog\nIt is amazing that [Ulysses supports posting to Micro.blog now](https://blog.ulysses.app/ulysses-22/). I love the functionality, and its inclusion definitely cements Ulysses as my only writing app on iOS and macOS at this point.\n\nNow let’s bug the Ulysses team to do some other cool things:\n\n1. Implement publishing workflows, by which publishing a sheet can automatically trigger the sheet to be tagged with a keyword, be moved to a particular folder (such as “published”), or call an iOS Shortcut.\n2. Make every command accessible via a hardware keyboard shortcut. (I’m thinking mainly of the iPad version.)\n3. Add a command palette, like Visual Studio Code and Sublime Text have.\n4. Support [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/), a text-based markup language for creating flowcharts, in fenced code blocks, like [Typora](https://typora.io) does. \n\n\n# CDC Says Schools Can Now Space Students 3 Feet Apart, Rather Than 6\n[As Anya Kamenetz, Cory Turner, and Allison Aubrey report on the _NPR_ website today](https://text.npr.org/978608714):\n\n> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its guidance for schools. On Friday, the agency announced it \"now recommends that, with universal masking, students should maintain a distance of at least 3 feet in classroom settings.\"\n> \n> Previously the guidance stated, \"Physical distancing (at least 6 feet) should be maximized to the greatest extent possible.\" The new guidelines still call for 6 feet of distance between adults and students as well as in common areas, such as auditoriums, and when masks are off, such as while eating. And the 6-foot distancing rule still applies for the general public in settings such as grocery stores.\n\nThis news is causing a good deal of consternation in my family. COVID cases are going up in our local schools right now. There has been an extremely high risk level in the community for several weeks, and in-person instruction is expanding anyway. Our school systems have been flatly stating that they will open even though they cannot conform with some of the requirements. This change in CDC requirements makes it easier for them to comply.\n\nI think the changing of, and complexity in, the distancing rules makes them seem suspect and less likely to be followed at all. This concern is counterbalanced, however, by my belief that distancing helps very little in the classroom, because every classroom I have seen has poor ventilation. My wife and I are keeping our kids remote until the end of the school year. We are still hopeful enough to consider September as the right time to send them back to in-person learning.\n\n\n🎵 I’m currently listening to [_Chemtrails over the Country Club_](https://music.apple.com/us/album/chemtrails-over-the-country-club/1545567745) by Lana Del Ray for the first time. I have been waiting for this one. Lana Del Ray is one of my favorite artists. It’s too soon for me to tell how much I like it.\n\n\n# Friday is time for Inbox Zero\nI have been an [Inbox Zero](http://www.43folders.com/43-folders-series-inbox-zero) guy since the early 2000s. Now I can’t keep up with my email; it comes in too fast, and I actually have work to do that demands my attention. Consequently, my Inbox is almost never empty. \n\nNow, mostly on Fridays, I just select all my Inbox emails (`Ctrl-A`) and move them to my Archive folder (`Ctrl-Shift-1` thanks to an [Outlook Quick Step](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/automate-common-or-repetitive-tasks-with-quick-steps-b184f89f-3738-4562-96de-c0244ea830f2) I created), whether I have processed them or not. The emails aren’t deleted, they are just out of my Inbox, and that’s good enough.\n\n\nI am investing some time trying to see if I could implement a [Johnny Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com) system for my files at work. Some of the constraints are tricky to deal with, but the general idea of it dovetails into what I have been doing for organization, and takes it one or two steps further.\n\n\n# Apple's new iPad Pro leaks ahead of rumored event\n[Corinne Reichert and Stephen Shankland report in _CNET_](https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-new-ipad-pro-leaks-ahead-of-rumored-event/): \n\n> Apple will launch a series of new iPads in April, a report Wednesday said. The new iPad Pros will come with Apple's homemade M1 chips, a Thunderbolt port, and better cameras and screens, according to Bloomberg. They will reportedly come in 11- and 12.9-inch display sizes.\n\nThat’s cool. Maybe I’m not a “Pro” but the iPad Air 4 is just about perfect for me. From my layman’s perspective, the A14-based chip in the iPad Air 4 is very similar to the M1, minus some of the cores. The 2020 iPad Pro’s chip (an A12Z) is a generation or two behind that, though it has more cores than the A14 does. Apple obviously needs to remedy that to help justify the iPad Pro’s greater price. \n\nI am thinking that the “Thunderbolt” port is merely following the direction that everything with a USB-C connector is going in: USB 4 compatibility. That, plus more processor cores, sounds good for videographers, podcasters, photographers, and (I guess) gamers. Unfortunately, if Apple doesn’t fix some problems with the Files app (just try transferring a gigabyte-sized file off your iPad to a network share—I’ll wait...for it to fail), these performance boosts will be hamstrung.\n\n\n# Effective Presentations\nWhen it comes to creating effective PowerPoint presentations for work, my reach still exceeds my grasp.\n\nI know a lot of important concepts, including the following:\n\n1. The slide deck is a visual aid, _not_ the presentation\n2. Focus on one idea per slide\n3. Focus on very few visual elements/focus points per slide (e.g., five or six, maximum)\n4. Light text on a dark background is easier on the eye\n\nUnfortunately, when I try to apply those ideas, I feel like I’m not getting anywhere. All of my slides look completely conventional: no better than those I created many years ago. I think they are effective, but they are ugly and boring. It does not help that I have to present on topics that are dry and technical in nature. I also feel hamstrung by my company’s PowerPoint template, which is quite busy, focuses attention on the wrong areas of the slide (i.e., the title and the footer), and has (almost completely) black text on a white background.\n\nI think I need to invent a visual style that I can get away with on at least some of my slides:\n\n- Full-bleed images that cover the entire slide, and obviate the need for titles or footers on my slides.\n- Text boxes that float over the images, or captions that fill in the top title area that is already part of our PowerPoint template.\n\nI just hope, if I do these things, my slides won’t end up looking like tired internet memes.\n\n\n# Team-building call with Lindsi Swartz 2021-03-09\nBackground:\n\nHealth administration\n\nBusiness school\n\nFilling out testing worksheets.\n\nLooking up procedure codes on findacode.com.\n\n\n🎵 The Hold Steady’s latest album, [Open Door Policy](https://music.apple.com/us/album/open-door-policy/1539020630), is growing on me. I know reviewers love it, because it is a return to form, but I was hoping for something different. It’s hard to say, what, though. Something that’s a mix of fun and depressing, like my favorite Hold Steady lyrics, I guess. \n\n\n🎵 I loved all of the “Playlists from Visionary Women” that were front-and-center on Apple Music for International Women’s Day today.

It says that it will continue to produce and focus on the HomePod mini, introduced last year.\n\nI, like many audiophiles, passed on the original HomePod due to its high price and lack of connectivity. I’m sure I would have enjoyed how it sounded, and its size is just right for me, but I would likely have had to buy two of them to be fully satisfied (stereo separation is important to me). At $349 each, that was too expensive.\n\nThe smaller, cheaper HomePod mini holds little appeal to me, and seems to be a far less interesting product for the audio engineers at Apple to work on. For all I know, though, it sells in huge numbers, which makes it interesting in and of itself. Maybe a HomePod mini max (ha!) will be released someday, at around $150, which will hit the price/performance sweet spot I am looking for.\n\n\n# The COVID-versary\nI guess, based on the occurrence of a President Biden speech, that this week marks [the one-year anniversary of COVID-19 in the United States](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/Voices/2021/03/12/Joe-Biden-COVID-19-anniversary-speech-full-text/8161615555448/). To me, the baleful presence of COVID-19 has been around for what feels like much, much longer—[so long that I can’t even remember it clearly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic).\n\nMy COVID panic started in early [January](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_January_2020), when we thought the disease was only in Wuhan. In America, for a couple weeks at least, it still seemed likely that the disease would never leave China, much like H1N1 and SARS never made a big impact here. For almost three months my mental state caromed between what I think of now as irrational fear and rational fear. I could see the whole year of 2020 play out in my imagination, way before my friends and family could see what was coming, but I could do nothing to stop it, and I could do almost nothing to protect my family from it. All those feelings felt very real and very debilitating, even when almost no one else around me was feeling them.\n\nI had about two months of angst about COVID before it actually hit around here. The last time I went out with friends and family was, I think, on March 14, 2020. We went to see a musical and when out to eat at a crowded restaurant afterward. It was really hard for me to feel comfortable the entire time, but I didn’t want to let everybody down because I was concerned about a pandemic that hadn’t hit our area yet. Less than a week later, my entire family was on lockdown.\n\nBack in January, February, and early March 2020, it didn’t help me at all to have known about the scope and length and shape of prior pandemics, like the [Spanish Flu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu), which I know, from reading family letters, killed a bunch of people in my extended family about a hundred years ago. It didn’t help me at all to know what I should do and buy to prepare for it. It didn’t help me at all that I am smart enough to think for myself and to scrutinize, with a pretty good understanding of the relevant science and statistics, the information and advice experts were providing to us. All of these things just made me feel more uncertain and more cynical about what was going on.\n\nA year later, I am feeling more hopeful. I have the vaccine after all, and am probably (but not definitely) immune to COVID 18. But my [county is still at extremely high risk level](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/monmouth-new-jersey-covid-cases.html). The numbers are still higher than they were last year when all of us were in a panic. Despite that, all the states, even blue states like mine, are reopening rapidly and throwing caution to the wind, when it would be more prudent to do so more gradually. It makes me nervous that we are giving the virus a chance to circulate long enough to adapt resistance to our vaccines.\n\nI was early in being scared of COVID, and I may be late in getting over that fear. I just hope that, when I look forward from today, whatever fear I feel is merely anxiety over things that will not play out, rather than the accurate foresight into the future that I had late last winter.\n\n\nThere was [a brush fire yesterday not too far from where I live](https://www.nj.com/news/2021/03/large-lakewood-brush-fire-closes-portion-of-gsp.html). Brush fires are incredibly rare where I live, so this is a curiosity to me. We have had dry, windy weather for about two weeks now, which makes wildfire conditions rife. My family was outside yesterday but fortunately we didn’t notice it; we must have been upwind.\n\n\nI’m probably being a climate-change alarmist right now, but I think we have never had such frequent windstorms in New Jersey as we have had this winter.\n\n\nI am grateful that the weather has changed from snowy and blustery to warm and calm. I have been able to take a walk after my lunch break for two days in a row. It feels nice.\n\n\n# 'This Is The Reality Of Black Girls': Inauguration Poet Says She Was Tailed By Guard\n[Matthew S. Schwartz reports for NPR](https://text.npr.org/974362036):\n\n> To millions of people around the world, the young poet Amanda Gorman represents hope, change and the promise of a better America.\n> \n> But to a security guard on Friday night, the young African American woman represented a potential threat to public safety.\n\nThis is a sad story. My first thought was that Amanda Gorman could legitimately have been harmed in a situation like this. Then I thought, she should have a bodyguard or an entourage with her at all times for protection. _Then_ I thought, she should not need to! That could ruin her life.\n\nAmanda Gorman is a strong and bold speaker, and deserves the last word on the matter:\n\n> \"In a sense, he was right,\" the former National Youth Poet Laureate added. \"I AM A THREAT: a threat to injustice, to inequality, to ignorance. Anyone who speaks the truth and walks with hope is an obvious and fatal danger to the powers that be.\"\n\n\n# Mermaid 🧜‍♀️ for flowcharts\nTonight I learned about [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/), which is a plaintext markup language and renderer for creating flowcharts and other kinds of diagrams.\n\nI want to make flowcharts quickly for my technical projects at work, but i don’t have Visio, and I hate fiddling with a GUI to line up shapes and worry about arrow lengths and so on. The way my mind works, I just want to type out what I want and have software figure out how to lay it out for me. I don’t care that much how it looks, as long as it is simple and makes sense. \n\nMermaid’s plaintext premise is really cool, and the syntax is flexible enough to not be awful. It is way more flexible than the examples on The Mermaid website originally led me to believe. You can name each shape whatever you like (not just single letter identifiers) and you can define the content (shapes) and relationships (arrows) separately if you want to. The only thing that stinks is that you have to manually insert html break tags (`<br/>`) for line breaks, because there is no word wrap. \n\nI still need to figure out what the best renderer is for me.

That, indeed, is the life of an auditor.\n\n\n# Gen: Lock\nI watched “[Gen:lock](https://roosterteeth.com/series/gen-lock)” over the past week. I was disappointed that it introduced a premise-breaking plot development in the penultimate episode. My beef is 100% spoiler-y.\n\nThe shows is a [mecha anime](https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/tags/mecha). Its premise is that, in some future war in which big robots piloted by people fight each other, a new type of mech is developed that is remotely controlled by very rare, very special kind of person. That person must bind her mind to the mech through a lot of hand-wavey technology called gen:lock.\n\nThe problem is, we learn three things in the final two episodes of season 1 that make the pilots unnecessary:\n\n1. A person’s mind can uploaded to, and downloaded from, a digital brain\n2. A digital brain can be copied an indefinite number of times.\n3. A digital brain is all that is needed to drive a mech\n\nIf one pilot’s mind can be copied, without harming her, and then bound to any number of mechs, then why do we need the pilots at all, once you’ve got the first one’s mind copied? If the pilots aren’t really necessary, why haven’t the characters in charge of the gen:lock program figured that out yet?\n\nI’m not sure I will pick it up again when season 2 comes out. Maybe this kind of anime isn’t for me.\n\n\n# Neera Tanden is Biden’s first Cabinet-level nominee to withdraw\n[Ella Nilson at vox.com reports](https://www.vox.com/2021/3/2/22310271/neera-tanden-biden-omb-withdraws):\n\n> But much of Tanden’s résumé was overshadowed by her proliferous online posting — at least 1,000 tweets raking both Republicans and leftist Democrats over the coals — that Tanden quietly started deleting in November 2020.\n\nI haven’t been following this story, but my interest was piqued when I learned that Neera Tanden’s nomination chances were in jeopardy because of her tweets from the past. People keep getting in trouble for what they post to Twitter. (“Social media” in these cases always is Twitter, too. That is probably just because it is public facing, though it is also a popular place for broadcasting, calling out, and grandstanding.)\n\nIt will soon be the conventional wisdom that those who seek high offices—in public service or in private industry—should have no public social media presence, no blog—certainly no Twitter account—maybe no public online presence at all. That bothers me because I think there is value in publishing one’s thoughts to the world, in a blog, vlog, podcast, or whatever other medium I can't even conceive of yet. People have an urge to share and should not feel that they will be punished for it, especially years after they tap the “post” button. \n\nI understand that some people are deliberately awful on social media, and that _is_ a problem, but isn't it also a problem that “the Internet never forgets?” [The right to be forgotten](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten) is at both ridiculous to ask for and essential for people to get along with each other after a certain point. How should we evaluate a person based on what she posted online? Does it matter how long ago a thought was posted? What is fair? I think we are at a cultural crossroads regarding these questions, and may be stuck at that crossroads for a long, long time.\n\n\n# Trust\nTrust relies on three things:\n\n1. Competence—can you do something well?\n2. Benevolence—are you doing good?\n3. Integrity—will you do the right thing, even when things are bad for you?\n\nI heard this breakdown on a podcast episode earlier this week, and loved the idea so much that I hastily dictated a note to Siri about it (I was in my car at the time), but I can’t recall which podcast I heard it on or who said it. I found an analogous summary of the idea on the Wiley Online Library site, in an abstract about a chapter of the book _[Handbook of Principles of Organizational Behavior: Indispensable Knowledge for Evidence‐Based Management, Second Edition](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119206422.ch21)_:\n\n> This chapter focuses on using the concepts of ability, benevolence, and integrity as a means of increasing trust. Ability, benevolence, and integrity are the most critical facets of trustworthiness. They foster a sense of trust in the leader by followers. Ability reflects the knowledge, skills, and aptitudes of a leader, in both technical areas and general management competencies. Benevolence and integrity are aspects of the leader's character, and require more time and attention on the part of followers before they can be reliably judged. In order to increase trust, leaders need to take steps to increase their ability, build their benevolence, and demonstrate their integrity. Leaders can do so on a follower‐by‐follower basis, but can also take steps to create a culture of trustworthiness within their organizations.\n\nBreaking down concepts like “trust”—which seem innately understood and obvious—into component parts can be very powerful. It gives you a way “in” when it comes to solving problems dependent on that concept.\n\n\n# Boston Red Sox's Dustin Pedroia announces retirement from MLB\n[Joon Lee of ESPN reports](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/30816259/boston-red-sox-dustin-pedroia-announces-retirement-mlb'):\n\n> Boston Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia, who hasn't played since 2019 because of a knee injury suffered two seasons earlier, announced his retirement Monday.\n> \n> \"Could it have ended better and I finished my career the right way? Yeah of course,\" Pedroia said on a Zoom call with the media. \"But there was a reason I was the first one dressed at 5:30 for a 7 o'clock game. I always tell my teammates that you never know if the game is going to start early. My biggest thing in my mind was that this could be my last game and you don't know. That's the best way I approached it from Little League on. I had the best time playing.\"\n\nAs a Red Sox fan, Pedroia’s retirement is no surprise. He hasn’t been physically able to play for years, since he got injured by a Manny Machado slide at second base. It is sad nonetheless. In his prime, he was fun and exciting to watch, and embodied the quality I enjoy seeing the most as a fan: “the love of the game.”\n\n\n# NYU researchers find no evidence of anti-conservative bias on social media\n[Kim Lyons reports in _The Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260269/anti-conservative-bias-social-media-no-evidence-nyu-research):\n\n> “The contention that social media as an industry censors conservatives is now, as we speak, becoming part of an even broader disinformation campaign from the right, that conservatives are being silenced all across American society,” the report’s lead researcher Paul Barrett said in an interview with The Verge. “This is the obvious post-Trump theme, we’re seeing it on Fox News, hearing it from Trump lieutenants, and I think it will continue indefinitely. Rather than any of this going away with Trump leaving Washington, it’s only getting more intense.”\n\nThis is one of those studies that *may* help future historians sort through the mess we are living through now. It is pretty obvious to me that there is a conservative bias on social media rather than a liberal one. The shocking election in 2016 of a mendacious “conservative” social media gasbag is enough proof. That he wasn’t deplatformed until he lost the 2020 election, despite sowing devision and inciting violence on social media platforms, is further proof of it.\n\nI bristle now at hearing or seeing the word “conservative” describe the people running a disinformation campaign against their fellow citizens. There’s nothing “conservative” about this influential and dangerous wing of the Republican Party, which is undermining the basic traditions and institutions of society. I identify strongly as a political progressive, but I am also quite conservative in how I think that people should behave publicly and how ethically and transparently political institutions should be run.\n\n\n# Fullmetal Alchemist\nWhile I have been working a ton lately, I can’t work every second of the day. I have been watching the “Fullmetal Alchemist” anime series (there are two), mostly late at night, to unwind.\n\nI watched the entirety of “Fullmetal Alchemist”—which is the first anime adaptation of the manga—first. Because it veers widely off of the plot of the manga (which, since I am not a manga reader, I don’t care about), it seems to be widely considered the lesser of the two adaptations. I think that sells it short. There are lots of sad, thought-provoking episodes, especially toward the beginning of the run, in which characters and the audience question what it means to be human, and what is the value of a human soul. These questions build up to big ideas and set pieces by the end, which is satisfying. There are some structural problems with how the story is told—mostly in the way the timeline, pacing, and character balance shift between the beginning, middle, and end of the series—but there is no problem that majorly detracts from the series as a whole. You could quibble that a lot of the theory behind how the magic system works doesn’t make any sense, which is vital to the overall theme of the series. Consider, however, that it is a _magic system_, you have to suspend disbelief quite a bit to begin with, and of course it doesn’t make perfect sense.\n\nI am almost done watching the second adaptation, “Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood”, which stays true to the manga plot and is generally lauded as the better of the two anime series. At this point, I don’t think of it as “better” but it certainly is much different. The stakes in “Brotherhood” are much higher, the characters are more tightly integrated throughout the series, and the tone overall is funnier and less sad, despite the raised stakes and some (somewhat) more mature relationship elements between childhood friends/teenage-phenoms Edward and Winry. Despite these advantages, “Brotherhood” is far more cartoony in style, which I don’t prefer. It uses _chibi_ (super deformed) style far more heavily than the first adaptation did, which I find distracting—the characters are often blowing their stacks in anger or are extremely embarrassed or go into some of other extreme, but emotionally and visually, that takes me out of the story a bit. That is a relatively small demerit, however, and it is offset by the increased complexity of the story.\n\nI am eager to see how “Brotherhood” ends, and would recommend that everyone try watching both series, especially the first one, because it is very good despite being the less-loved one.\n\n\n# Little Voice\nMy wife and I recently discovered the Apple TV+ show “[Little Voice](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/little-voice/umc.cmc.4x932osv992wjjdq7ce12za2r)” and very much enjoy it.\n\nIt is different in pace and tone from other shows (like “Curb Your Enthusiasm”) that we have been watching lately. While there is a lot going on in each episode, the pace feels slow and thoughtful, as if the show is focused mainly on the growth of its characters and on illustrating (a version of) the New York City music scene. I would not recommend watching “Little Voice” for its main plot, because it appears to follow the well-worn path of “talented-but-unknown artist slowly becomes successful.” That said, there are a ton of great character moments throughout.\n\nThe main draw of the show is the music, most of which are songs written by series co-creator Sara Bareilles. There is a lot of music performance in each episode. All these sections look great, sound great, and are integrated completely naturally into the story. However, they serve as the primary reason why the pace is slow. If you don’t like the music, then the show will not be for you. \n\nOverall, I think that “Little Voice” is under-rated. It didn’t blow up like “Ted Lasso” (which is, indeed, great) or “Central Park” (which is also great), but is my third-favorite Apple TV+ series thus far.\n\n\nI have been super, super, super busy today, and it just won’t stop. It looks like I’ll be working a lot of overtime...like right now. At least, once the kids go to bed, I can put my headphones back on and enjoy some music while I work.\n\n\n# The Business of Influenece with MKBHD\nI found this [fairly long interview on _The Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/22231657/mkbhd-marques-brownlee-interview-youtube-creator-influencer-decoder) with Marques Brownlee ([MKBHD on YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/mkbhd)) to be very interesting:\n\n> But what looks effortless and fun to the viewer is often the result of careful planning and investment. YouTubers are entrepreneurs, and Brownlee — my guest on today’s episode of Decoder — talks that talk with the best of them.\n\nMarques Brownlee could be described as “tech reviewer” or a “social media influencer” or a “YouTuber.” I don’t watch all his videos, but I have checked in with his YouTube channel periodically since I first saw him (as a college student!) on an episode of TWiT. While he is telegenic and charismatic, he also presents himself as someone with a strong sense of ethics who is very smart and thoughtful about he approaches his business. This interview gives a pretty long look into Marques Brownlee’s professional world.\n\nMy wife, who is a high school teacher, recently reported to me that one of the top “professions” that teens want to go into is “social media influencer.” That is kind of eyeroll-inducing to me, but I suppose it is as realistic and as meaningful an aspiration as “famous writer” was to me. It is important to know how much work goes into that sort of job, and how much time, investment, and infrastructure goes into keeping up with the competition.\n\n\nI don’t really want to criticize [TapBots for making TweetBot version 6 a subscription app](https://www.macstories.net/news/tweetbot-6-moves-to-subscription-pricing/). I would like to highlight that $6.99/yr is a reasonable price to pay every year if you use an app every day. I wish more annual app subscriptions were below the $9.99 level.\n\n\n# The Covid-19 Vaccines Are Amazing. Let’s Quickly Get Them into People’s Arms.\n[Jason Kottke’s blog post](https://kottke.org/21/01/the-covid-19-vaccines-are-amazing-lets-quickly-get-them-into-peoples-arms) offers some great advice that we all should heed:\n\n> So what can you do about this right now? 1. Stop worrying about the variants until the experts let us know we have something to worry about. 2. If you are eligible for the vaccine, get it! 3. Spread the word about vaccine availability in your area. Yesterday Vermont opened signups for vaccination appointments for all Vermonters 75 and older, and I texted/emailed everyone I could think of who was over 75 or who had parents/relatives/friends who are over 75 to urge them to sign up or spread the word. 4. Continue to wear a mask (a better one if possible), wash your hands, social distance, stay home when possible, don’t spend time indoors w/ strangers, etc. Thanks to these remarkable vaccines, real relief is in sight — let’s keep on track and see this thing through.\n\nMy family is now obsessed with wearing two layers of masks, which I tried but couldn’t get to work with my glasses on. I am more interested in finally being able to buy and wear N95, KN95, and KN94 (my favorite) masks, which are more effective than the cloth masks and surgical masks I have been stuck with since February.\n\nIn New Jersey, vaccine distribution is both successful (my wife, who is a teacher, got her first dose yesterday) and a total mess (it is very hard to get an appointment, there is no central coordination of virus distribution, and any effective effort on prioritizing inoculations for higher-risk groups is effective gone). If my family is a good indicator of people’s behavior, then lots of us New Jerseyans keep hammering away at the appointment systems, trying to get a better appointment slot, which further jams up the system.\n\n\nI wrote a support email to [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app) last week inquiring about [micro.blog](https://micro.blog) support.

During the same period last year, the agency reported 1,016 cases.\n\nI get a vaccine every year for the flu—and luckily have not caught it since I was in elementary school—but other than that, I never think about it. My dream right now is that the COVID vaccine be the same kind of thing: a prick on the arm once a year, and otherwise nothing much to think about.\n\n\n🎵 I’m trying out [PlexAmp](https://plexamp.com) again, and am listening to Herbie Hancock’s “Gershwin’s World” (in [ALAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lossless)) which has been in my library for over twenty years and probably hasn’t been listened to since 2000.\n\n\nI made the mistake today of turning off my home media server (HP N54L) for a few minutes to see how quiet my office is without its fan running.

So the last time I was in a room with a lot of people was the table read episodes one and two of season three, and we were ready to go. Then it all got shut down. Season three is completely written, ready to go, and then during this time we actually went and wrote season four. So we have both of those kinda done. We’re just waiting until we can start shooting again.”\n\n“Barry” is a _ sui generis_ example of peak TV. It takes a lot of risks in terms of both plot and tone, and so far they have all paid off. I certainly couldn’t predict how Bill Hader and Alex Berg were going to write their way out of the end of Season 2 of “Barry,” but I guess they cracked it and then some.\n\n\n[Music for Programming](http://musicforprogramming.net/#) is definitely not for me, but I *love* the all-text site design.\n\n\n# Why did I get a webcam again? 😂\nI just got a Logitech C920 webcam to use for video calls at work.

One thing auditors are trained to investigate is called “tone at the top,” which represents the values expressed by the top management of a company which are expected from everyone who reports up to them. \n\nAfter auditing for years, I have discovered that “tone at the top” is almost everything you need to know about an organization to get an idea how well and how ethically it is operated. Ethics and decency from the top of an organization really do trickle down all the way to the bottom and permeate it entirely. Moreover, they are strongly indicative of the organization’s *solvency*—its ability to hold together as a going concern over time.\n\nWhen the “tone at the top” is selfish, vain, petty, petulant, aggrieved, unethical, amoral, and violent—as Trump’s has been—that tone trickles down to the whole organization, and pollutes the thoughts and corrupts the actions of the people within it. Unfortunately in this case, the “organization” is not just the Executive Branch, not just the federal government, and not just the Republican Party: it is the entire United States of America. What’s more, because the U.S. is a vastly influential country, the corruption and willful deceit at the head of it spills over into the rest of the world.\n\nI feel like I have known this from the beginning—before the slow-moving coup even started—because I understood what the “tone at the top” was, and knew that it was vitally important. _Knowing_ this, sadly, is not enough, because in a democracy a majority of people need to know this for things to turn out better. Being _able_ to know this, like being able to discern the “tone at the top” as a new auditor, is a rare gift. It requires a trait that is not easily acquired, but is so difficult to teach and to learn that it is often considered to be innate: _shrewdness_. \n\nThat’s because “tone at the top” isn’t always as blatantly obvious as Trump’s vitriolic tweets and shambolic rally speeches. Understanding what the “tone at the top” _really_ is, it requires a combination of healthy skepticism, decent powers of observation, and the knowledge of how things are supposed to work. You have to understand both context *and* subtext; subtext is much harder to grasp than context, but is often the more important to the two. You have to interpret people’s words *and* actions, and compare them to each other to see if the actions follow the words. You also have to have some kind of ethical foundation—which may be laws of the state, societal norms, or virtue ethics— on which to base your conclusions. \n\nThe human mind has evolved to do a lot of this analysis automatically. Consider that establishing whether you trust another person is, and always has been, an essential part of human interaction. But, like a lot of thought processes that are largely automatic, many times mental shortcuts are taken and the wrong choice is made. To be able to second-guess these automatic thought processes takes intellect, some degree of guidance, and a willingness to think a little harder.\n\nI would not be surprised to learn that many of the people trying to unlawfully overturn the election—not counting the elected officials who are operating out of cynical self-interest—really do think they are making an ethical decision, and really do think they are doing the right thing. They just trusted the wrong person, or made the wrong decision about voting for or supporting, because they lack the shrewdness and imagination to discern that the “tone at the top” really does matter, and that bad words from a lazy president really will lead to riots in the streets.\n\n\nI realized today that in, ACL, a scripting language I use at work, I have been using a mixture of `PascalCase` and `snake_case` (like this: `Table_Name`) that is the worst of both worlds in terms of typing difficulty. Fortunately, ACL is not case-sensitive.\n\n\n# Zero\nI am a big fan of [the Zero app](https://medium.com/[@kevinrose](https://micro.blog/kevinrose)/introducing-zero-a-new-app-to-help-you-fast-209935e8245d), which is a tracker for intermittent fasting. It is free, attractive, and has just enough features to keep me engaged and motivated, and no more. \n\nCurrently, my favorite feature is its Apple Watch complication, which fills up a ring (similar to the Activity app’s rings) as you progress through your fasting period. I find that filling that ring every day, and the app's cheerful notifications every morning, really help motivate me to stop snacking or having an extra meal at night.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about it is that it requires you to set up an account with an email address. While the company behind it does not appear to be abusing my privacy in any way, I would prefer that they didn’t require an account. Perhaps they will adopt Sign in with Apple when it becomes available this fall.\n\nIf you are interested in Zero, [download it from the iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zero-fasting-tracker/id1168348542?mt=8).\n\n\n# Thoughts on Apple Card\nI got the Apple Card about a week ago, and just started using it this weekend. Here are some initial thoughts:\n\n1. I very much like the security and privacy features Apple Pay and the Apple Card. I try to use Apple Pay whenever I can to take advantage of most of these features, no matter what card I was using.\n2. I very much like the enhancements to the Wallet app on my iPhone to review transactions and spending.\n3. 2% cash back on all Apple Pay purchases seems like a pretty good benefit to me.\n4. 3% back on Apple transactions seems a little stingy, considering that Amazon and Target offer 5% back when you use their branded cards. I would get a much better cash-back rate buying an Apple product on Amazon, using my Amazon.com Visa.\n5. The interest rate offered to me was the lowest that they offer, and it is a between two and three percentage points lower than the other cards I have. I never carry a balance, so it doesn’t mean much to me.\n6. I had a false-alarm fraud alert shortly after I set it up. I made it my default on my Apple account, and a $30 annual subscription fee trigged a fraud alert. I contacted Apple Card support via iMessage, and cleared up the problem.\n7. Buying different things changes the color of the card in the Wallet app, which is amusing. The colors correspond to the spending charts.\n8. I had a lot of trouble adding the card to my Apple Watch. It took lots of fiddling with settings, but, fortunately, I did not have to unpair and repair the Apple Watch to my iPhone.\n9. The titanium card is boring and heavy. I expect to never use it. Its best feature is that my card number is not printed on it.\n10. Some common features are missing: a website, integration with personal finance applications, and joint accounts (or authorized users).\n\n\nBlog post: SwiftoDo Development Notes, July 2018 [https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/swiftodo-develop…-notes-july-2018/](https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/swiftodo-development-notes-july-2018/ \"https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/swiftodo-develop…-notes-july-2018/\")\n\nBlog post: [SwiftoDo Development Notes, July 2018](https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/swiftodo-development-notes-july-2018/)\n\n\n# 📚 Ready Player One, by Ernest Cline\nEarlier this year, I completed reading _[Ready Player One](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One)_ by Ernest Cline. It was the first novel that I had read in a while, as I have been reading mostly nonfiction in recent years. I discovered the book from an [episode of the “Triangulation” podcast in which Leo Laporte interviewed author Andy Weir](https://twit.tv/shows/triangulation/episodes/322), who enthusiastically recommended the book. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the book. The prose is efficient and the pacing is swift. I thought it started out strong, and I liked the world building and the build-up of suspense in the early chapters. After a while, though, I tired of all the 1980s video game and movie references, and wanted the book to end. While I was about three quarters through the book, I referred to it as “the reading equivalent to watching somebody else play video games”. For me, the stakes felt too low, and the characterizations were too thin, to make a lasting impression. Still, I had fun reading it, at least most of the way through.\n\n\n# Introducing The New Yorker Crossword Puzzle\n[The New Yorker just launched a crossword puzzle](https://www.newyorker.com/crossword/puzzles-dept/2018/04/30).\n\n> Most of our readers have e-mail addresses now, and the Web has given us the space to try new things—and to try old things again. In that spirit, we’re launching another crossword, online this time, and in the American style. It’ll be weekly, just like the magazine: a new one every Monday morning\n\nI am a daily crossword puzzle player. I enjoy them, though I am not terribly good at them, because I love word games and have read that crosswords help keep your mind sharp into old age.\n\nThe New Yorker puzzle is a _tiny_ bit more challenging than I would like (as I said, I’m not a strong player), but I’m happy there’s another source of crossword puzzles (beyond the New York Times, which I also subscribe to) coming may way.\n\nI hope they will someday move it into their iOS app. The scrolling behavior, which affects the on-page keyboard, is annoying on mobile.\n\n\n# Prolific Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo departs KGI Securities, likely to focus on companies other than Apple\n[Kuo’s departure](https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/30/prolific-apple-supply-chain-analyst-ming-chi-kuo-departs-kgi/) comes hot off the heels of [Apple’s recent “leaked” memo](https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/13/apple-memo-on-leaks-leaks/) about leaking that threatened the leaky leaders who leak. \n\n> Why has Ming-Chi Kuo, arguably one of the most popular technology analysts in the world, decided to move on? One possible reason is that his sources have done likewise, or perhaps have even been removed in light of Apple’s recent memo and strong stance against leaks — supply chain or otherwise.\n\nI wondered why myself, and figured that Apple has either threatened him, or his sources, with criminal lawsuits. I, for one, wouldn’t mind if Apple finally closed up all the leaks in its supply chain. While these leaks may benefit Apple investors, they don’t really benefit Apple fans that much.\n\n\nBlog post: [SwiftoDo Development Notes, April 2018](https://mjdescy.me/2018/04/28/swiftodo-development-notes-april-2018/)\n\n\n# How We Got To Now\nI recently finished reading Steen Johnson’s [How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/books/review/how-we-got-to-now-by-steven-johnson.html). It was a breezy and pleasurable read, full of interesting information. Johnson’s writing is clear, concise, and engaging throughout. \n\nAs a huge nerd who spent a lot of time in childhood perusing a science and technology encyclopedia, and a lot of time in my teens watching tech-related documentaries on Discovery and TLC (before those networks drifted to reality TV), I already knew a lot of the material. Still, it’s a wonderful read to anyone who loves the “history of ideas course” way of looking at disparate, seemingly unrelated things in everyday life, and drawing a through line that connects them all. Plus I learned new phrases that describe these unintended and intended technological and cultural developments—“hummingbird effects” and “the adjacent possible”—that I particularly like.\n\n\n# I miss Caesar salad\nIt seems to me that massive outbreaks of food borne illness are becoming more and more common. That [our current, worsening outbreak](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-outbreak-worsens-98-people-now-sick-n869681) is the *second* E. Coli outbreak tied to my favorite type of lettuce in the past six months or so, and it is so virulent, is making me feel worried about our food system, and pessimistic about my country’s will to improve it.\n\n> An outbreak of E. coli food poisoning linked to romaine lettuce has widened and has now made at least 98 people sick, federal health officials said Friday.\n> \n> More than half have had to be hospitalized because the strain of E. coli causing this outbreak is an especially nasty one, the officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said.\n> \n> People in 22 states have reported E. coli infections linked to the outbreak, the CDC and FDA said.\n\nI’m no expert in this, but I feel like we have several problems in our food system that have, in the past few decades, started to compound in dangerous ways that we should have seen coming. Some of these problems include overcrowding of animals, overuse of antibiotics in livestock, and over-concentration in production and processing. When bad hygiene infects food, it’s worse now than it used to be. The bacteria are more resistant to antibiotics, and the food, and food borne illness, is distributed all across the country.\n\nAnother annoyance to me, as a someone who has eaten some raw eggs (usually in cookie dough or homemade eggnog) and rare meat over the years, is that I have *never* gotten a food borne illness from those activities. I have, however, gotten terribly ill several times from eating restaurant salads, probably due to unwashed hands or vegetables. There are menu warnings about undercooked meat in every restaurant I go to, but none about the danger of eating unwashed vegetables.\n\nI am impatiently awaiting the day I can eat Caesar salads again.\n\n\nWhile I was on vacation, I wrote a series of blog posts about all my old speaker systems. My goal was to trace my journey from a normal person to an audiophile, as I upgrade my gear up over the years.\n\n1. [Speakers over the years](https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/10/speakers-over-the-years/)\n2. [My first speaker system](https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/11/my-first-speaker-system/)\n3.

[Altec Lansing M650 iPod Speaker Dock](https://mjdescy.me/2018/08/17/altec-lansing-m650-ipod-speaker-dock/)\n\nThe speakers that I have had are nothing special, but they are special, in a way, to me, because of all the music I listened to through them.\n\nI plan to write another, hopefully more interesting, series about my various headphones in the near future.\n\n",

				"content_text": "I was thinking about creating a training presentation to help my coworkers with keyboards shortcuts, but was dismayed to see that our Lenovo laptop keyboards (which I never use, because I work from home and use external peripherals) don’t even have a menu key. Someone decided that `Print Screen` was more important, which may even be true, but it doesn’t help me make a good presentation for my coworkers. The menu key alternative, `Shift+F10` is going to be a very hard sell, especially because `F10` on the laptop requires the `Fn` key to be pressed, too.\n\nI have gone from someone who did not use the [menu key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_key) on my keyboard for 20+ years (since it was invented in the 1990s) to someone who can’t live without it (on my Windows at least).

I figured that the Snyder cut must be better, but I was surprised at how much better it is. Granted, it still isn’t <em>good</em>. It doesn’t fix its pacing problems. It still is not as brisk and pleasurable as the best of the Marvel movies. It doesn’t tell a cohesive story, but it also crams in too many story lines for a non-DC fan to keep track of. It still has some dumb script problems, such every single part of the nonsensical museum height/terrorist bombing blot in the opening Wonder Woman scene, that could have been solved by editing a few sentences of dialog. While not exactly <em>good</em>, it is a good bad movie now. Its reach often exceeds its grasp, but it offers a lot of interesting material to people who are already fans. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to be the kind of movie that would bring a lot new fans in.</p>\n\n<p>It is now very clear to me that Zach Snyder’s vision was dark and wild and weird—definitely too much of all of those things to launch a successful franchise—but Joss Whedon’s contributions were just awful: tasteless, asinine, nonsensical, and insulting to the audience. Whedon’s dialog (notably Superman’s and The Flash’s) and the character moments he created, like the race between The Flash and Superman, are embarrassing to watch and make the characters seem stupid. Snyder’s cut simply had better dialog for them. Simply getting rid of the random <em>people</em> that Whedon put into that nuclear wasteland Russian city—the one that existed in the movie only to be destroyed in a bout of cinematic excess—made the climax bearable.

Some fans, like me, believe that comic book characters are archetypes, and really can be <em>anything</em>, and no representation of them is truly canonical. The grim, dark version of the Justice League is an interesting thought experiment, one of many worth exploring.

There’s nothing “conservative” about this influential and dangerous wing of the Republican Party, which is undermining the basic traditions and institutions of society. I identify strongly as a political progressive, but I am also quite conservative in how I think that people should behave publicly and how ethically and transparently political institutions should be run.\n",

Because it veers widely off of the plot of the manga (which, since I am not a manga reader, I don’t care about), it seems to be widely considered the lesser of the two adaptations. I think that sells it short. There are lots of sad, thought-provoking episodes, especially toward the beginning of the run, in which characters and the audience question what it means to be human, and what is the value of a human soul. These questions build up to big ideas and set pieces by the end, which is satisfying. There are some structural problems with how the story is told—mostly in the way the timeline, pacing, and character balance shift between the beginning, middle, and end of the series—but there is no problem that majorly detracts from the series as a whole. You could quibble that a lot of the theory behind how the magic system works doesn’t make any sense, which is vital to the overall theme of the series.

At this point, I don’t think of it as “better” but it certainly is much different. The stakes in “Brotherhood” are much higher, the characters are more tightly integrated throughout the series, and the tone overall is funnier and less sad, despite the raised stakes and some (somewhat) more mature relationship elements between childhood friends/teenage-phenoms Edward and Winry. Despite these advantages, “Brotherhood” is far more cartoony in style, which I don’t prefer. It uses <em>chibi</em> (super deformed) style far more heavily than the first adaptation did, which I find distracting—the characters are often blowing their stacks in anger or are extremely embarrassed or go into some of other extreme, but emotionally and visually, that takes me out of the story a bit. That is a relatively small demerit, however, and it is offset by the increased complexity of the story.</p>\n\n<p>I am eager to see how “Brotherhood” ends, and would recommend that everyone try watching both series, especially the first one, because it is very good despite being the less-loved one.</p>\n",

One thing auditors are trained to investigate is called “tone at the top,” which represents the values expressed by the top management of a company which are expected from everyone who reports up to them.</p>\n\n<p>After auditing for years, I have discovered that “tone at the top” is almost everything you need to know about an organization to get an idea how well and how ethically it is operated. Ethics and decency from the top of an organization really do trickle down all the way to the bottom and permeate it entirely. Moreover, they are strongly indicative of the organization’s *solvency*—its ability to hold together as a going concern over time.</p>\n\n<p>When the “tone at the top” is selfish, vain, petty, petulant, aggrieved, unethical, amoral, and violent—as Trump’s has been—that tone trickles down to the whole organization, and pollutes the thoughts and corrupts the actions of the people within it. Unfortunately in this case, the “organization” is not just the Executive Branch, not just the federal government, and not just the Republican Party: it is the entire United States of America. What’s more, because the U.S. is a vastly influential country, the corruption and willful deceit at the head of it spills over into the rest of the world.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like I have known this from the beginning—before the slow-moving coup even started—because I understood what the “tone at the top” was, and knew that it was vitally important. <em>Knowing</em> this, sadly, is not enough, because in a democracy a majority of people need to know this for things to turn out better. Being <em>able</em> to know this, like being able to discern the “tone at the top” as a new auditor, is a rare gift. It requires a trait that is not easily acquired, but is so difficult to teach and to learn that it is often considered to be innate: <em>shrewdness</em>.</p>\n\n<p>That’s because “tone at the top” isn’t always as blatantly obvious as Trump’s vitriolic tweets and shambolic rally speeches. Understanding what the “tone at the top” <em>really</em> is, it requires a combination of healthy skepticism, decent powers of observation, and the knowledge of how things are supposed to work. You have to understand both context <em>and</em> subtext; subtext is much harder to grasp than context, but is often the more important to the two. You have to interpret people’s words <em>and</em> actions, and compare them to each other to see if the actions follow the words. You also have to have some kind of ethical foundation—which may be laws of the state, societal norms, or virtue ethics— on which to base your conclusions.</p>\n\n<p>The human mind has evolved to do a lot of this analysis automatically. Consider that establishing whether you trust another person is, and always has been, an essential part of human interaction. But, like a lot of thought processes that are largely automatic, many times mental shortcuts are taken and the wrong choice is made. To be able to second-guess these automatic thought processes takes intellect, some degree of guidance, and a willingness to think a little harder.</p>\n\n<p>I would not be surprised to learn that many of the people trying to unlawfully overturn the election—not counting the elected officials who are operating out of cynical self-interest—really do think they are making an ethical decision, and really do think they are doing the right thing. They just trusted the wrong person, or made the wrong decision about voting for or supporting, because they lack the shrewdness and imagination to discern that the “tone at the top” really does matter, and that bad words from a lazy president really will lead to riots in the streets.</p>\n",

Unfortunately in this case, the “organization” is not just the Executive Branch, not just the federal government, and not just the Republican Party: it is the entire United States of America. What’s more, because the U.S. is a vastly influential country, the corruption and willful deceit at the head of it spills over into the rest of the world.\n\nI feel like I have known this from the beginning—before the slow-moving coup even started—because I understood what the “tone at the top” was, and knew that it was vitally important. _Knowing_ this, sadly, is not enough, because in a democracy a majority of people need to know this for things to turn out better. Being _able_ to know this, like being able to discern the “tone at the top” as a new auditor, is a rare gift. It requires a trait that is not easily acquired, but is so difficult to teach and to learn that it is often considered to be innate: _shrewdness_. \n\nThat’s because “tone at the top” isn’t always as blatantly obvious as Trump’s vitriolic tweets and shambolic rally speeches. Understanding what the “tone at the top” _really_ is, it requires a combination of healthy skepticism, decent powers of observation, and the knowledge of how things are supposed to work. You have to understand both context *and* subtext; subtext is much harder to grasp than context, but is often the more important to the two. You have to interpret people’s words *and* actions, and compare them to each other to see if the actions follow the words. You also have to have some kind of ethical foundation—which may be laws of the state, societal norms, or virtue ethics— on which to base your conclusions. \n\nThe human mind has evolved to do a lot of this analysis automatically. Consider that establishing whether you trust another person is, and always has been, an essential part of human interaction. But, like a lot of thought processes that are largely automatic, many times mental shortcuts are taken and the wrong choice is made. To be able to second-guess these automatic thought processes takes intellect, some degree of guidance, and a willingness to think a little harder.\n\nI would not be surprised to learn that many of the people trying to unlawfully overturn the election—not counting the elected officials who are operating out of cynical self-interest—really do think they are making an ethical decision, and really do think they are doing the right thing. They just trusted the wrong person, or made the wrong decision about voting for or supporting, because they lack the shrewdness and imagination to discern that the “tone at the top” really does matter, and that bad words from a lazy president really will lead to riots in the streets.\n",

Its use is similar to that of Sonny &amp; Cher&rsquo;s &ldquo;I Got You Babe&rdquo; from the 1993 film Groundhog Day.  Lyonne explained that in choosing the song she was struck by the &ldquo;buoyant doomsday quality&rdquo; of Nilsson&rsquo;s life. The cost of using the song so many times took up a significant portion of the music budget. His estate also limited how many times the song could be used.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Reading this got me thinking about what nonsense music rights are for TV and movies. Why are song rights so expensive? Moreover, why should Nillson&rsquo;s estate be able to limit &ldquo;how many times the songs could be used? (Harry Nilsson died in 1994.) That sounds so frustrating to deal with.

Good on them to unbolt their software from the underlying OS. I think it will give them a lot more flexibility going forward. I don&rsquo;t know if I will <em>run</em> FreeNAS on Linux anytime soon, though. I learned to adore BSD&rsquo;s stability and simplicity from running FreeNAS, but it has made it harder to virtualize and/or run some useful services on my hardware.</p>\n\n<p>Kris Moore went on to clarify:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>FreeNAS as it exists will continue on FreeBSD for 12.0 and beyond. This will be bringing some of the same software-base to Linux to unveil some new products that are Linux-based in the coming months. If you currently are happy with FreeNAS as it sits today, you can expect to keep updating it on BSD going forward.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All of this sounds good to me.

The middleware at the core of FreeNAS is already pretty portable today, and we want to start extending its reach.\n\nThat's pretty cool. Good on them to unbolt their software from the underlying OS. I think it will give them a lot more flexibility going forward. I don't know if I will _run_ FreeNAS on Linux anytime soon, though. I learned to adore BSD's stability and simplicity from running FreeNAS, but it has made it harder to virtualize and/or run some useful services on my hardware.\n\nKris Moore went on to clarify:\n\n> FreeNAS as it exists will continue on FreeBSD for 12.0 and beyond. This will be bringing some of the same software-base to Linux to unveil some new products that are Linux-based in the coming months. If you currently are happy with FreeNAS as it sits today, you can expect to keep updating it on BSD going forward.\n\nAll of this sounds good to me. FreeNAS has been a great platform for me for many years now.\n",

Steve Bullock of Montana was bad for a party trying to win back voters who flocked to President Trump in 2016.\n> “Voters aren’t even going to know who Steve Bullock is and that we have a governor representing a red state and doing it with strong progressive values,” Ms. Kleeb said. “To me it shows the strength of our party that we have so many people running.”\n\nI know Ms. Kleeb is merely supporting her candidate, but why is he even running if he has no national presence? \n\nHonestly, if hardly anybody knows who you are, why do you think you can win an election for President of the United States? 🤷‍♂️\n",

But now an even stricter version of low-carb eating called the ketogenic diet is gaining popular attention, igniting a fierce scientific debate about its potential risks and benefits.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>I am grateful that ketogenic diets are being treated seriously enough to be written about in a national newspaper. Unfortunately, the New York Times is trying to <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teach_the_Controversy\">teach the controversy</a>, when no such controversy actually exists.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Here are some clarifying points about some of the topics discussed or touched upon in the article, from someone who actually follows a sensible, low calorie, vegetable-rich ketogenic diet:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n\n<p><ol><li>There is no &ldquo;Keto diet&rdquo;. There are a variety of <em>ketogenic</em> diets, all with the common element that they tend to put the body in a state of <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis\">nutritional ketosis</a> at some point (not all day long unless you fast; primarily while you are sleeping). All these diets involve restricting carbohydrate intake to very low levels, ranging from 0 g to about 50 g per day. They differ in meal composition, meal timing, and what foods are allowed or disallowed. Also, in real life, even people on ketogenic diets will eat a high-carbohydrate treat now and then.</li><li>Nutritional ketosis is not the same as <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoacidosis\">ketoacidosis</a>.</li><li>Ideally, ketogenic diets involve eating a great deal of high fiber (but low starch) vegetables. Imagine telling your doctor that you eat two huge salads per day, with four ounces of meat on them, one ounce of cheese, and a tablespoon or two of olive-oil-and-vinegar dressing.

There are a variety of <em>ketogenic</em> diets, all with the common element that they tend to put the body in a state of <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis\">nutritional ketosis</a> at some point (not all day long unless you fast; primarily while you are sleeping). All these diets involve restricting carbohydrate intake to very low levels, ranging from 0 g to about 50 g per day. They differ in meal composition, meal timing, and what foods are allowed or disallowed. Also, in real life, even people on ketogenic diets will eat a high-carbohydrate treat now and then.</li><li>Nutritional ketosis is not the same as <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoacidosis\">ketoacidosis</a>.</li><li>Ideally, ketogenic diets involve eating a great deal of high fiber (but low starch) vegetables. Imagine telling your doctor that you eat two huge salads per day, with four ounces of meat on them, one ounce of cheese, and a tablespoon or two of olive-oil-and-vinegar dressing. Doctors have told me that it is hard to eat healthier than that.</li><li>Ketogenic diets are\"high fat\", on a <em>percentage basis</em>, not necessarily on an absolute basis (as in, grams of fat per day). </li><li>Similarly, ketogenic diets are not necessarily higher in meat or dairy consumption that the standard American diet.</li><li>I have read many, many abstracts and articles about diet and nutrition studies.

It has been a fantastic server. I bought it, a slightly used review unit, loaded with four 500 GB drives that it would not have normally come with, for a song—less than a new one with no storage drives included. Over the years, I updated the storage (now I have 16 TB total, with 8 TB usable space, set up in a single RAIDZ2 volume), and the RAM (from 8 GB to 16 GB). Over that same time period, 8 TB went from an impressive amount of storage to something a relatively inexpensive single drive could handle.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>What those single drives don’t have, however, is redundancy and data integrity features. My little FreeNAS server has that, thanks to the ZFS file system. At several times in my home media streaming career, the external hard drive I used to store my media files died, and I lost all my data. Thankfully, no important personal data, like my photos, was ever lost, but the experience was upsetting enough not to want to repeat any more. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Hard drive failures can happen to anyone, at any time, even if you have a nice server rather than a Raspberry Pi with an external hard drive attached via USB. Less than a year after I upgraded my FreeNAS server’s drives, one of them failed. The  FreeNAS server emailed me about the error, and its UI showed that my drive array was operating in a degraded state. I quickly ordered a new drive, swapped it out the next day, and never lost a bit of data. (I returned the failed drive for a free replacement, so now I have a replacement available, in case I ever need it.)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n\n<p><h2>File servers fill up, if you let them</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>FreeNAS has been stable, reliable, and a joy to use. One thing I have learned from running it, however, is that its file system, ZFS, degrades in performance when a volume (a pool of drives) is more than 80% full. FreeNAS will warn you about this threshold, but I never took it too seriously, because poor performance is mostly an academic concern when all you are doing with a server is transferring a few gigabytes a day. I do like to silence warnings, however, so I normally have to prune my media collection, or move some videos I want to keep, but am unlikely to watch again soon, to external, mostly cold, storage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Of course, where is that old, external drive with my files on it? I have no idea. So, this week, when my FreeNAS server filled up way over the 80% warning threshold, I decided, rather than continuing to free space by deleting movies and TV series that I didn’t want to delete, to add some more redundant storage to my network, and move the old files there. This decision was mostly based on having some extra hardware lying around, unused. I have a <a href=\"https://www.seagate.com/support/network-attached-storage/business-storage/seagate-nas/\">2 TB, two-bay Seagate NAS</a>, which is a little, Linux-based server with a consumer friendly web UI for administration. Unlike FreeNAS, it is very locked down, and unlike my HP microserver, it has only two drive bays rather than four.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>At any rate, I set that up again and started moving some files to it, which sounds simpler than it really is. I am cherry picking files that are less likely to be accessed to the new server, so I have to go through everything I have, to some extent. Because the files either number in the thousands (like music files) or are multiple gigabytes in size (like video files), moving them has been very slow. Because the Seagate NAS’s filesystem (EXT4) is different than the FreeNAS filesystem (ZFS), there are other interesting problems, like file naming rules, that trip up file transfers. Because these are two different UNIX-like systems with different users configured on them, sometimes there are permissions issues that prevent files from being moved, renamed, or deleted. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>As cool as it is to stream movies and music throughout my house, making it all work requires, from time to time, a lot of low-level file transfers.

				"content_html": "<p>For someone who is, now, only marginally interested in television and movies, I have spent a lot of time and money over the years to make my television watching experience awesome. I used to be <em>really</em> into it, and—unless you had a lot of money to burn—it used to be hard to get it working correctly, which fed into my engineering mindset and led me to tinker with hardware and software frequently, for almost a decade.</p>\n\n<p>I started in 2008 by connecting my 13” white MacBook to my (non-HD) TV via a $30 video adapter. Even though my TV was primitive, picture quality was way better when playing video this way, and I could watch streaming videos directly from the networks’ web sites, like “Lost”, on my real TV for the first time. I loved it. After about a year of this, I got a mini-PC as a Christmas gift, which I started using, with an external hard drive, as a home media server.</p>\n\n<p>For the front end, I bought a set-top box that Western Digital used to sell. The system worked&hellip;mostly. Streaming over WiFi was reliable for non-HD (480p) and 720p HD encoded TV shows, but anything with higher resolutions, higher bit rates, or DTS audio would usually be impossible to play.</p>\n\n<p>I was never serious enough to buy an expensive computer to connect to my TV, because I figured, correctly it turns out, that video streaming devices would become cheaper and more capable over time. Of course, during that time, I cycled through a <em>ton</em> of set-top boxes (most of which I got for free as review units): Roku boxes, a couple Roku knock-offs, the Boxee Box, the first Amazon Fire TV, an Amazon Fire TV Stick (which was quickly returned), a couple Raspberry Pis running XMBC (which worked great for TV but stumbled on DTS audio), and eventually a number of Apple TVs (fourth generation).</p>\n\n<p>The reason I went through so many front-ends is that they all had two limitations. First, each one left out at least one of the top video sources: either iTunes, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or Plex. (Nothing left out Netflix.) Second, all of them choked on certain sorts of videos, depending on their audio or video encodings.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, I began to watch video on my iPad while I work. This led me to discover Plex in the App Store. Plex is a server that you can install on a computer, coupled with client apps that run on many different devices. Plex looks great, has server side transcoding to make video formats less of an issue, and allows you to manage a centralized library of TV, movies, music, and more. I used Plex on an Amazon Fire TV for a year or two. I started out very happy with it, but the software stability of the Amazon Fire TV decreased over time, and Plex and Amazon did not release software updates timely enough to fix it. Eventually, I was very unhappy with the Fire TV + Plex combo, but still pretty happy running Plex on my iPad.</p>\n\n<p>When the Apple TV, 4th generation, was released, with support for iTunes, Apple Music, Netflix, YouTube, and Plex, I bought one right away. I figured, at the time, that Apple was so big that only it had any chance to get all the major video providers on a single box, and get them to stay long term. (Amazon, of course, was conspicuously absent for several years, but that was not as important to me back then as it is now.) I didn’t expect to love it for to watch baseball on MLB At Bat, but it plays games at 1080p/60fps, which looks amazing, so I <em>do</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Over time, home media streaming went from being a niche hobby, in which nerds like me tried to hook up computers to their TVs, to a very mainstream way to consume video and audio. Thanks to cheap and nearly ubiquitous modern hardware, my home media streaming “hobby”, has basically come to an end. I still maintain a Plex library, but I no longer have to upgrade or to fiddle with hardware connected to my TV, or worry about audio and video encodings and bit rates before I watch a movie with my wife. I also stream a lot more video from outside the home (not via Plex) than I ever did before—just like everybody else these days. It’s not special any more; it’s just another entertainment product, and it deserves very little thought, because it just works. Things are much better now, but sometimes I do miss tinkering with hardware.</p>\n",

First, each one left out at least one of the top video sources: either iTunes, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or Plex. (Nothing left out Netflix.) Second, all of them choked on certain sorts of videos, depending on their audio or video encodings.\n\nEventually, I began to watch video on my iPad while I work. This led me to discover Plex in the App Store. Plex is a server that you can install on a computer, coupled with client apps that run on many different devices. Plex looks great, has server side transcoding to make video formats less of an issue, and allows you to manage a centralized library of TV, movies, music, and more. I used Plex on an Amazon Fire TV for a year or two. I started out very happy with it, but the software stability of the Amazon Fire TV decreased over time, and Plex and Amazon did not release software updates timely enough to fix it. Eventually, I was very unhappy with the Fire TV + Plex combo, but still pretty happy running Plex on my iPad.\n\nWhen the Apple TV, 4th generation, was released, with support for iTunes, Apple Music, Netflix, YouTube, and Plex, I bought one right away. I figured, at the time, that Apple was so big that only it had any chance to get all the major video providers on a single box, and get them to stay long term. (Amazon, of course, was conspicuously absent for several years, but that was not as important to me back then as it is now.) I didn’t expect to love it for to watch baseball on MLB At Bat, but it plays games at 1080p/60fps, which looks amazing, so I <em>do</em>.\n\nOver time, home media streaming went from being a niche hobby, in which nerds like me tried to hook up computers to their TVs, to a very mainstream way to consume video and audio. Thanks to cheap and nearly ubiquitous modern hardware, my home media streaming “hobby”, has basically come to an end. I still maintain a Plex library, but I no longer have to upgrade or to fiddle with hardware connected to my TV, or worry about audio and video encodings and bit rates before I watch a movie with my wife. I also stream a lot more video from outside the home (not via Plex) than I ever did before—just like everybody else these days. It’s not special any more; it’s just another entertainment product, and it deserves very little thought, because it just works. Things are much better now, but sometimes I do miss tinkering with hardware.\n",

I am hopeful that all the effort will have been worth it when I can start using it next week.</p>\n\n<p>I <em>am</em> stressing myself out a little bit while doing this work, though, because it would look like I spent the past day or two not moving forward on actual <em>output</em> at all, even though moving forward next week will be much more efficient. I always have to compare the time it will take me to automate parts of my work with the time it will take me to simply ground it out. Of course, both time estimates are usually just guesses for me, because most of my work is one-off project work, which is never repeated (at least not in the same way) on the next project. Luckily for me, I have the weekend off to forget about time and budget pressure for a couple days.</p>\n\n<p>My daughter passed level 50 in Reading Eggs tonight, which she does at school and at home on her Chromebook. I am very proud of her. She has recently started working much harder at learning to read. My wife and I have been pushing her a little harder lately, too, and even hired her a reading tutor (who is super nice) to help her. The best thing to happen about it this week is that we are now all on the same page about, and saying aloud to each other, that increasing her reading skills is the top priority. It helps to be able to prioritize things.</p>\n\n<p>My son probably will never need a reading tutor, but he will need to go to preschool in the fall, and my wife and I have to figure out how to pay for it. We have already started scaling back our expenses (mainly monthly subscriptions and dining out), but have not gone into full-on budget mode just yet. We have started talking about money again, which is good. We may start using YNAB again, but I don’t care for the price of their subscription.</p>\n\n<p>I have been working on a huge update to one of my apps,  SwiftoDo Desktop, which is a todo.txt task list manager for the Mac. The current version is super old now, and I re-wrote it from scratch, basing the model code on the iOS version I have been working on for a couple years now. At this point, the new Mac version is even better than the iOS version, but it is still not ready for release. Based on the brief time I can work on it, late at night, I imagine I have several weeks to go before I can release it.</p>\n\n<p>Also, today, I released a bug fix update to one of my other apps, <a href=\"https://simplecallblockerapp.com\">Simple Call Blocker</a>. I fixed a bug that made its call blocking extension not load for a lot of people. It turns out the problem had to do with calling an Apple API incorrectly—and I think the rules changed since I initially released the app, because it used to work without a problem. I had thought the bug was related to the app’s Core Data stack, which I had no way to fix, but it turned out to be something different. It feels good to fix that bug, and hopefully put a stop to all the customer emails I get about it.</p>\n",

				"title": "SwiftoDo Development Notes, September 2018",
				"content_html": "<p><h2>Files integration</h2>In late August I released a version of SwiftoDo that added sync support for any cloud data provider, via integration with the Files app. I think that this integration can be improved in the future. For example, right now, you cannot <em>create</em> a todo.txt file in the Files app using SwiftoDo, and you cannot open an existing todo.txt <em>from</em> the Files app.</p>\n\n<p>If I add those features, I may as well rewrite the app’s UI, so that you have to create or open a file upon SwiftoDo’s launch. I would also have to rewrite how preferences are stored, so users could define different preferences for different files they open.</p>\n\n<p>Those changes would, I think, necessitate dropping the offline support features that currently exist—namely manual sync mode, and the failsafes in place for when automatic sync fails (typically due to network unavailability). I am actually not sure how other document-based apps on iOS handle things when network connectivity is lost or unavailable. I would assume they simply cannot work without a constant network connection, because they cannot access their file, but I am not sure.</p>\n\n<p>I do know that a task list is not a typical document-based app, like a text editor. Users typically want it to be always available, rather than dependent on a constantly-available network connection. Because I would rather not remove offline features from my app, and because I currently have very little time for app development, I do not plan any big changes to the app related to Files integration in the near future. When they do happen, I would expect that the UI of the app would be changed pretty significantly.\n<h2>iOS 12 Support for SwiftoDo</h2>The current version of SwiftoDo runs on iOS 12 without incident. I have, however, compiled a new version of SwiftoDo on the iOS 12 SDK. It has no new features, but the SDK is newer, so it inherits upstream bug fixes from Apple, and I updated my codebase to Swift 4.2. I am dropping support for iOS 10.x, too, because iOS 12 will be released imminently, and it honestly makes no sense for anyone with an iOS device from the past four years or so not to upgrade to it (iOS 12 performance is that good). Because of the under-the-hood changes, and the dropped compatibility with iOS 10, I am bumping the version number to 3.0.0. (Don’t get too excited!)\n<h2>macOS Mojave Support for SwiftoDo Desktop</h2>I am running the MacOS Mojave beta, and have been testing out its new dark mode. I love dark mode, and it took me about two seconds to realize that dark mode support is not a nice-to-have—it is an absolute necessity. Therefore, have coded support for it in a new build of SwiftoDo Desktop. I will submit it to the App Store soon.</p>\n\n<p>The next version of SwiftoDo Desktop will be compiled on the macOS 10.4 SDK, and will no longer support macOS versions lower than that. (If you are not going to upgrade to Mojave, you can continue to use the version of SwiftDo Desktop you are currently using, of course.)</p>\n\n<p>Other than dark mode support, there are no new features. (Sorry!) Because of the under-the-hood changes, and the change in minimum system requirements, I am bumping the version number to 3.0.0, though. (Again, don’t get too excited, but be happy your app is being supported.)\n<h2>The future of SwiftoDo Desktop</h2>It is a weird coincidence that SwiftoDo and SwiftoDo Desktop will be on the same version number for a while, but it is only a coincidence. At present, they do not share any underlying code.</p>\n\n<p>My long term plan is for SwiftoDo to resemble, and share tons of code with, the iPad version of SwiftoDo. The approach I would prefer to take would be to use the joint iOS/macOS framework that Apple said is coming next year. I will probably continue work on improving the iOS version’s codebase in preparation for eventual macOS support as well.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure if every user will want the iOS version on the desktop, but I know that <em>I</em> would. I have considered releasing the next-generation version, whenever it is ready, under a new name (SwiftoDo Desktop 2, maybe) and SKU, so owners of the current SwiftoDo Desktop could continue to use it until it no longer functions on macOS. I have not decided exactly what I will do just yet.</p>\n\n<p>I do not expect that anyone outside Apple will learn anything about Apple’s new framework until WWDC 2019, which will be held in June. What I learn at that time will have significant impact on the direction in which I take SwiftoDo Desktop.</p>\n",

Its sound is warm, rich, and natural.

It replaced my Harmon Kardon Soundsticks, which sounded better for music, but were not as easy to connect to my iPhone. It sounds great for music, podcasts, and for TV—thanks to its line-in jack, I often plugged an iPad into it for better audio when watching baseball or Netflix. I liked this speaker so much that I bought another one for the kitchen, where it was a great base station for phone charging and playing internet radio for several years.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, while this speaker sounds great, its 30-pin dock is poorly implemented. After several months, both speakers emit annoying static from the 30-pin connector unless the iPhone is seated just right.

It has gotten increasingly difficult to seat an iPhone on them without getting static through the 30-pin connection, but it is still possible. However, because the 30-pin iPhones that drive them are old and barely work at this point (software-wise), these speakers’ days as iPhone docks are numbered.

				"title": "Harman Kardon Soundsticks II Speaker System",
				"content_html": "<p>In my mid 20s, I decided to move from boring (but nice) suburban Connecticut back to the Boston area where I went to college. It was a chance to reinvent myself, which is something I really needed to do at the time.</p>\n\n<p>In the process, I replaced a lot of my belongings—cheap things or hand-me-downs that I had since my college days—with newer, better versions. I replaced nearly everything I cooked with and ate with: dishes, pots and pans, and small appliances. I bought a new wardrobe and got rid of my ratty old T-shirts and jeans. I traded up from a slow and struggling Dell tower PC to a sleek, fast, white MacBook (my first Mac!). I also traded up from my old, busted Altec Lansing computer speakers to the cool, futuristic Harman Kardon Soundsticks II that I saw in the Apple Store.</p>\n\n<p>The Soundsticks’ clear plastic construction made them almost invisible. Their clear, light-up subwoofer looked like a bioluminescent jellyfish floating atop the tangle of wires under my desk. Their capacitive touch volume control was futuristic, too, but really hard to control; I mainly relied on my MacBook’s volume control instead.</p>\n\n<p>In my cool, urban apartment, I played music through these cool, stylish speakers for hours and hours each day as I worked on my new MacBook (and on my work laptop, side-by-side). They sounded much better than my prior Altec Lansing computer speakers, but mostly they just looked better. I found that, at loud volumes, they didn’t really fill the room how I would have liked them, but I rarely played them that loud anyway, considering they were sitting on the desk I was working at.</p>\n\n<p>During this time, I stopped buying CDs and started buying music online.

				"content_text": "In my mid 20s, I decided to move from boring (but nice) suburban Connecticut back to the Boston area where I went to college. It was a chance to reinvent myself, which is something I really needed to do at the time. \n\nIn the process, I replaced a lot of my belongings—cheap things or hand-me-downs that I had since my college days—with newer, better versions. I replaced nearly everything I cooked with and ate with: dishes, pots and pans, and small appliances. I bought a new wardrobe and got rid of my ratty old T-shirts and jeans. I traded up from a slow and struggling Dell tower PC to a sleek, fast, white MacBook (my first Mac!). I also traded up from my old, busted Altec Lansing computer speakers to the cool, futuristic Harman Kardon Soundsticks II that I saw in the Apple Store.\n\nThe Soundsticks’ clear plastic construction made them almost invisible. Their clear, light-up subwoofer looked like a bioluminescent jellyfish floating atop the tangle of wires under my desk. Their capacitive touch volume control was futuristic, too, but really hard to control; I mainly relied on my MacBook’s volume control instead.\n\nIn my cool, urban apartment, I played music through these cool, stylish speakers for hours and hours each day as I worked on my new MacBook (and on my work laptop, side-by-side). They sounded much better than my prior Altec Lansing computer speakers, but mostly they just looked better. I found that, at loud volumes, they didn’t really fill the room how I would have liked them, but I rarely played them that loud anyway, considering they were sitting on the desk I was working at.\n\nDuring this time, I stopped buying CDs and started buying music online. I got into indie rock very heavily, mainly because I could get their tracks at great prices (25 cents per track) though eMusic.

The only difference between them was in the peripherals: the Gateway came with a 19-inch monitor, rather than a 17-inch monitor, and the Dell came with a USB-connected, 2.1 channel Altec Lansing speaker setup.

The subwoofer added a new dimension to my music that I had never experienced before. It could shake the room if I wanted that, or just add some sub-bass dimension to the music. Its presence inspired me to pair this speaker set with my old, 2-channel Altec Lansing computer speakers, to create a 4.1 channel setup that I used to watch DVDs in my dorm room in 1999 and 2000.

Building it was a fun diversion, and I learned a lot in the process, too. If you’re reading this, you’re probably wondering what’s up with SwiftoDo, however. I have been working on it this summer, too.</p>\n\n<p>Since this spring, I have been promising everyone that I’m working on iOS 11+ Files app integration. This feature will let SwiftoDo open files from any cloud service provider that ties into the iOS 11+ Files app. That includes Dropbox, Box, NextCloud, OneDrive, Google Drive, and many others. Adding additional data providers to SwiftoDo has been a long time coming.</p>\n\n<h2>Some background on SwiftoDo data providers</h2>\n\n<p>I designed SwiftoDo data providers to be plugins that could be swapped out, which would allow me to support numerous cloud storage providers. I have had so much trouble getting the Dropbox data provider to be solid and stable, however, that I was loath to create more data providers. My thinking was that I was liable to cause more problems for my users (and myself!) than I would solve. Therefore, I concentrated on fixing up the Dropbox data provider code, which is now, after three or four rewrites, pretty solid.</p>\n\n<p>(The Dropbox data provider code has always <em>worked</em>, but it had a rare but nasty crashing bug for some time, and some issues related to stability, ability to handle spotty network connections, and ability to handle, <em>gracefully</em>, Dropbox “rate limit exceeded” API responses.)</p>\n\n<p>iOS 11’s Files app, which I did not anticipate being available when I first wrote SwiftoDo, obviates the need for additional “native” data providers. I just wasn’t sure if SwiftoDo would be able to tie into it.</p>\n\n<h2>Can Files integration be used for SwiftoDo?</h2>\n\n<p>I have been under the impression that integrating with the Files app would require a rewrite of major sections of the app, or would simply not work well due to sandboxing limitations. I thought this because all Files-based iOS apps that I have used follow Apple’s “Document-based app” template very closely: Think “Microsoft Word” rather than “Reminders” in terms of user interaction patterns. They open to a file browser, you open a document (typically a single document), work on the document, save it (automatically), and close the app. The life cycle of a document is fairly limited: after the app is killed, your file is closed and does not reopen on load. Most of these apps don’t work offline at all, unless you’re working with local-only files, because they can’t open your file.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, SwiftoDo works a lot differently. It manages your task list locally and syncs it to an external file. It lets you archive completed tasks to a second external file. It keeps the opening and choosing of files down to a minimum. Most users set up their todo.txt and archive files once and never touch those settings again. It lets you work offline (primarily in “manual sync mode”, but also when the network is unavailable) and sync your changes to the cloud on demand.</p>\n\n<p>Integrating SwiftoDo with the Files app, without giving up anything, seemed like it might be a considerable challenge.</p>\n\n<h2>A “Files” data provider</h2>\n\n<p>To my surprise, implementing a “Files” data provider has not been as challenging as I thought it would be. Accessing documents via the iOS document picker and restoring them after the app is killed, via secure bookmarks, is actually pretty easy. It took me only a couple hours to set up a data provider that would upload and download to iCloud Drive and even Dropbox through the Files app.</p>\n\n<p>That is not nearly enough to ship the feature, though. There are still some issues regarding stability and error handling that I have to work through.</p>\n\n<p>Adding this feature also prompted me to display file names in Settings (rather than 2 screens deep in Settings) and atop the task list in the main view.</p>\n\n<h2>What is next?</h2>\n\n<p>After I finish the Files data provider work, and the new Xcode and iOS versions are officially released, I plan to build SwiftoDo on the iOS 12 SDK and drop iOS 10 support. I’ve been thinking of bumping the version number to 3.0 at that point, to mark the change in iOS compatibility.</p>\n\n<p>I will also consider the future of Files integration in SwiftoDo. It temping for me to remove the entire “data provider” layer and just make SwiftoDo a normal iOS document-based app. That would be a big deal, and I would not make that change unless I understood fully what that would mean for users.

				"content_html": "<p>Recently I released a new iOS app: <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-call-blocker/id1409872025?ls=1&amp;mt=8\" title=\"Available on the App Store\">Simple Call Blocker</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It is a <em>free</em> utility that lets you block unwanted calls to your iPhone. Unlike most of the call blockers on iOS, it allows you to block whole ranges of numbers, such as your phone number’s extension, <em>for free</em>. You may also <em>whitelist</em> numbers, ranges of numbers, or all your contacts’ phone numbers, so that they will not be blocked by this app, even if they are in the blacklist.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://simplecallblockerapp.com\">Simple Call Blocker website</a> explains it in more detail.</p>\n\n<h2>Why did I write it?</h2>\n\n<p>I wanted to write a small, relatively simple app that would allow me to explore the following things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>iOS application architecture: I have been reading books and articles on iOS application architecture, and decided to create a new app to practice new techniques, such as the use of coordinators for navigation rather than storyboard segues, that I have been learning.</li>\n    <li>algorithms and operation queues: I started the app by writing some simple algorithms for creating sequential phone number ranges to load into an <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit\">iOS CallKit directory extension</a>. The last thing I wrote was a multi-threaded operation queue for processing blacklist and whitelist rules and refreshing the iOS call directory extension that actually blocks the phone numbers.</li>\n    <li>Core Data: I avoided learning Core Data for years; that changed with this app.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Overall, the app was a lot of fun to write. It took me about a month in my after-hours “free time” to create. The overall process has made me a better iOS app developer. I’m excited to bring forward the skills and concepts I developed on this project to future work.</p>\n\n<h2>Why a call blocker app?</h2>\n\n<p>I started getting <a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/en/us/article/news-releases/16670-a-new-kind-of-phone-scam-neighbor-spoofing\">neighbor spam calls</a>, so I downloaded nearly all the iOS call blocking apps I could find. There were fewer such apps than I thought there would be, all of them seemed amateurish in some way or another, and all of them (as of a month ago) required an in-app purchase or a subscription to block my neighborhood exchange. I wasn’t willing to pay for that feature in any of the apps that I tried, because all of those apps weren’t that good. Plus, blocking an exchange, or a continuous range of numbers, is pretty trivial, so I thought I could create an app that did that, and offer it for free to people.</p>\n\n<h2>So is this just a “practice” app?</h2>\n\n<p>No. It is well-written and works as well as iOS’s Call Directory extensions allow it to. It has a rough edge or two, though, in that it reloads its directory extension and reports success or errors back to the users, rather than trying to prevent the user from ever encountering an error from being reported by the directory extension loading process.</p>\n\n<p>What that means is that you <em>can</em> ask Simple Call Blocker to block more numbers that iOS will allow—there is an undocumented limit—and the app has to wait for the CallKit Directory Extension’s load process to report success or failure before it can tell the user what is going on. I decided not to try to impose limits on how many numbers could be blacklisted, but instead allow the app to report the Directory Extension’s errors, if any, back to the user. I figure that the undocumented maximum number of blocked phone numbers probably is dependent on whatever hardware is in your phone, and probably is increasing in every new iPhone model.</p>\n\n<p>The Simple Call Blocker directory extension is coded extremely conservatively, and it optimized for very low RAM and system usage. If iOS cannot load it, it is because the user put too many numbers in the blacklist, or because it is still loading numbers from a prior attempt.</p>\n\n<p>Releasing the app for free, I think, makes it OK that it may not work exactly as users expect it to.</p>\n\n<h2>What is the future of this app?</h2>\n\n<p>I plan to support it through various iOS releases, but otherwise not improve it too much. After all, it is a free app.</p>\n\n<h2>I want to know more!</h2>\n\n<p>Go ahead and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-call-blocker/id1409872025?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">download the app in the iOS App Store</a> (it’s free!), and check out the <a href=\"https://simplecallblockerapp.com\">FAQ</a> online.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I’m re-committing to <a href=\"https://pinboard.in\">Pinboard</a>, after a year or more away from it. I’m happy with what I am doing now, and thought I would document it in case anyone else wanted help understanding how to use the Pinboard effectively, especially if their usage lapsed, as mine did.</p>\n\n<h2>What is Pinboard?</h2>\n\n<p>Pinboard is an “antisocial” cloud bookmarking service. You can keep all your bookmarks there and use its barebones website or third party apps and browser extensions, all using an open API, to access them. It’s a paid service, run by a single person, with a clear and straightforward business model. When I signed up, I pre-paid for ten years of service. Part of my impetus for using it again now, after having abandoned it for, well, nothing, is the sunk-cost fallacy. The other, more important part of that impetus is that I really like the simplicity and speed of Pinboard, and I like the Pinboard iOS client I use, <a href=\"http://pinnerapp.net\">Pinner</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What do I use it for?</h2>\n\n<p>I use it for three things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>To host my bookmarks in a cross-platform, always accessible way. I can get to the same bookmarks in Safari on my Mac and iOS, and in Chrome on Windows.</li>\n    <li>For research and archival purposes, especially for programming projects I am working on. I can search these bookmarks on keywords, title, or description to review <em>the best</em> of the web pages I previously read on a topic of interest.</li>\n    <li>As part of a homegrown “read it later” service. I can send article URLs to Pinboard from various apps, and read them later using Pinboard’s website, an app or browser extension on my Mac, and an app on iOS or Andriod.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Number 3 used to be the <em>primary</em> purpose of Pinboard to me. I had signed up as part of an effort to get replace Pocket with something more privacy focused. After many years of using <a href=\"https://getpocket.com\">Pocket</a> (formerly “Read It Later”) to collect articles I was interested in from the huge stream of RSS feeds I parsed every day, I wanted a change. Primarily, this was because I became uncomfortable with Pocket’s business model: Why was it free? How did they really make money? What were they doing will all the data they collected on me?</p>\n\n<p>I also wasn’t crazy about some of the UI changes made to Pocket over the years. I wanted more control over the reading experience, too, which is something that using a web service with an open API would give me. It helps that, at the time, <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/how-use-reader-view-safari-iphone-and-ipad\">Safari’s Reader View</a> debuted, and I thought it was fantastic.</p>\n\n<p>I was pretty obsessive about channeling all the articles I read through Pinboard, so I had a one-way workflow from discovery to reading to marking read. I never deleted anything from Pinboard, either. I thought I wanted a history of all the articles I ever read, in case I wanted to search through that history later. (Of course, I never did that.)</p>\n\n<h2>Why did I stop using it?</h2>\n\n<p>I stopped using Pinboard for three main reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>I started reading Twitter <em>more</em> than actual articles linked to from it. The constantly updating timeline was incredibly addictive, and less mentally taxing to follow than reading complex articles from actual publications. (I have since given up Twitter because it was <em>too</em> addictive for me to handle responsibly.)</li>\n    <li>My wife and I had kids, meaning that I no longer had a bunch of downtime after dinner to catch up on all the articles I had bookmarked to read later. I would still send stuff to Pinboard to read later, but I would never actually read the articles.</li>\n    <li>My wife and I subscribed to <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>The New York Times</em>, and <em>The Washington Post</em>. I started reading from those publications, from their apps, a lot more than scouring RSS feeds for articles from a dozen sources. Reading from their apps did not fit very well with my Pinboard workflow.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Overall, Pinboard became a graveyard for links I didn’t actually want to read. Instead of a useful resource, it was a junk pile full of stale content.</p>\n\n<h2>Digging out of a mess</h2>\n\n<p>I took the following steps to return Pinboard to a useful utility for me:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>I deleted <em>everything</em> I had in Pinboard—over 3,000 bookmarks that were doing me no good. Most of these were articles I imported from my RSS reader (Reeder) or Twitter (via Tweetbot), read once, and then just left in Pinboard.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>I installed <a href=\"https://aki-null.net/shiori/\">Shiori</a> on my MacBook Pro. Shiori is a Pinboard bookmark launcher and editor. It's like <a href=\"https://qsapp.com\">QuickSilver</a> for Pinboard—hidden until you need it, only a keypress away, and accessible from anywhere. I set it up so that Control+Option+Command+P brings up the bookmark search window (from anywhere), and Control+Option+Command+B brings up the bookmark editor.</li>\n    <li>I set up <a href=\"http://pinnerapp.net\">Pinner</a> on iOS. Pinner is a full-featured Pinboard client. It will open Pinboard bookmarks in Safari or within Pinner, via Safari View Controller. It has two app extensions for creating bookmarks. The first extension, “Quick Pin”, has no UI, and is for quickly adding bookmarks to read later. The second extension lets you edit, interactively, all the metadata associated with the bookmark prior to saving it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>My workflow</h2>\n\n<p>I developed a new workflow to work with Pinboard, so I don’t end up with a mess of useless bookmarks again. Honestly, though, calling it a <em>workflow</em> is an exaggeration. I basically decided to manage Pinboard with a simple set of rules.</p>\n\n<p>I will continue to use Pinboard both for permanent bookmarks, which mostly involve specific technical documentation about Swift and iOS development, and for a read-it-later service, which are bookmarks I want to keep around temporarily, some of which I plan to keep long term.</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>Bookmarks I would keep in Safari, for sites I would log into (banking websites, personal websites, blogs, GitHub, BitBucket, etc.), are stored as private bookmarks with tags. All of these bookmarks are also tagged “Safari” so I can pull them all, as a group, with a Pinboard search.</li>\n    <li>Bookmarks for articles to read later, and everything else, are saved with the “read later” flag set to “true”, primarily by using Pinner’s “Quick Pin” extension or the “send to Pinboard” command within <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/ios/\">Reeder</a> (my RSS reader app of choice).</li>\n    <li>I regularly use Pinner or Shiori to browse my “read later” list. Basically, I had to kick the Twitter habit.</li>\n    <li>After I read articles marked “read later”, I delete the bookmark, or choose to save it. I am pretty ruthless about deleting bookmarks now, which is the opposite of how I used to be. If I don’t read something after a few days, I will just delete it.</li>\n    <li>Rarely, I will choose to save the bookmark. If I do so, I edit the bookmark’s metadata to remove the “read later” flag and to add keywords and a description. I open copy the first paragraph of the article to the bookmark’s description field, so it’s clear to me later on why I saved it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So far this workflow has been working well for me. I collect “read later” bookmarks throughout the day, read through them in the evening, and delete almost all of them at the end of the day. My Pinboard bookmarks list is much smaller than before, but contains only good stuff that I want to act on, either now or later.</p>\n",

I basically decided to manage Pinboard with a simple set of rules.\n\nI will continue to use Pinboard both for permanent bookmarks, which mostly involve specific technical documentation about Swift and iOS development, and for a read-it-later service, which are bookmarks I want to keep around temporarily, some of which I plan to keep long term.\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Bookmarks I would keep in Safari, for sites I would log into (banking websites, personal websites, blogs, GitHub, BitBucket, etc.), are stored as private bookmarks with tags. All of these bookmarks are also tagged “Safari” so I can pull them all, as a group, with a Pinboard search.</li>\n\t<li>Bookmarks for articles to read later, and everything else, are saved with the “read later” flag set to “true”, primarily by using Pinner’s “Quick Pin” extension or the “send to Pinboard” command within <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/ios/\">Reeder</a> (my RSS reader app of choice).</li>\n\t<li>I regularly use Pinner or Shiori to browse my “read later” list. Basically, I had to kick the Twitter habit.</li>\n\t<li>After I read articles marked “read later”, I delete the bookmark, or choose to save it. I am pretty ruthless about deleting bookmarks now, which is the opposite of how I used to be. If I don’t read something after a few days, I will just delete it.</li>\n\t<li>Rarely, I will choose to save the bookmark. If I do so, I edit the bookmark’s metadata to remove the “read later” flag and to add keywords and a description. I open copy the first paragraph of the article to the bookmark’s description field, so it’s clear to me later on why I saved it.</li>\n</ol>\n\nSo far this workflow has been working well for me. I collect “read later” bookmarks throughout the day, read through them in the evening, and delete almost all of them at the end of the day. My Pinboard bookmarks list is much smaller than before, but contains only good stuff that I want to act on, either now or later.\n",

				"title": "A Hardware Keyboard Shortcuts Tip for Drafts 5",
				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"http://getdrafts.com\">Drafts 5</a> is a great app for capturing thoughts, drafting notes, and capturing tasks, and quickly sending them, via <em>Actions</em>, to other apps or services for further processing. The typical workflow is:\n<ol>\n    <li>Launch Drafts</li>\n    <li>Type a draft</li>\n    <li>Launch an Action to process the draft</li>\n</ol>On iPhone, swiping left from anywhere to pick an Action is right at your fingertips, since you are typing on screen. On iPad, if you type with an external keyboard (which I highly recommend), launching an Action is a little more cumbersome. By default, you have to move your fingers off the keyboard and reach up to the screen to get to your Actions list. There is another way to launch Actions, however, that doesn&rsquo;t require you to move your fingers off the keyboard.\n<h2>Custom hardware keyboard shortcuts</h2>Drafts 5 lets you assign custom hardware keyboard shortcuts to any Action. This is an extremely rare, and extremely powerful, feature. You can configure hardware keyboard shortcuts for text formatting commands and to insert text snippets (such as today&rsquo;s date) into your draft. You can also define a set of hardware keyboard shortcuts to use to complete your drafts.</p>\n\n<p>I use Drafts 5 throughout the day to write microblog posts, notes, and tasks and send them to where they need to go: Dropbox, Ulysses, my to-do app <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com\">SwiftoDo</a>, and so on. For all my most-used Actions that process drafts, I use an easy-to-mash but hard to accidentally type accelerator, <code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>, plus one letter, when I complete my draft and want to send it on its way.</p>\n\n<p>I use the <code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code> accelerator <em>only</em> for Actions that complete drafts, so it&rsquo;s always clear to me when I type it that I am ending my draft and sending it somewhere else.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my list of hardware keyboard shortcuts, each of which I find incredibly useful:\n<ul>\n    <li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>D</code>: save draft to a Dropbox folder</li>\n    <li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>U</code>: save draft to a Ulysses Inbox folder</li>\n    <li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>T</code>: send tasks in draft to my todo.txt file via SwiftoDo</li>\n    <li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>M</code>: post draft directly to Micro.blog</li>\n    <li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>G</code>: search for draft text in Google</li>\n    <li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>A</code>: search for draft text in App Store</li>\n</ul>Each shortcut is easily mapped to its Action via the &ldquo;Edit Action&rdquo; dialog. (See the photo that accompanies this blog post.) If you forget what custom shortcuts you created, hold down <code>Command</code> while editing your draft, and all the custom shortcuts you defined will appear in the standard iOS hardware keyboard shortcut pop-up display.</p>\n\n<p>These hardware keyboard shortcuts don&rsquo;t necessarily save me a <em>lot</em> of time and trouble, but they make my Drafts workflow on iOS feel fast and comfortable.

				"content_html": "<h2>There’s more beauty in this world than you can guess</h2>\n\n<p>Recently, with the help of someone on <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a> and Apple Music, I have turned my family on to the music of Justin Roberts. His band plays children’s music in a power pop style. His music is really catchy, and his lyrics are wry, funny, very kid-friendly (my daughter sings them all the time), and sometimes also play to the parents on emotional level as well.</p>\n\n<p>My favorite Justin Roberts song, by far, is “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNb5SPOYLCQ\">Recess</a>”. Like the best power pop songs, this song has more hooks and ideas in it than most albums do. The lyrics are cleverly and consistently written from the point of view of a bored kid stuck in a classroom, waiting for the recess bell to ring:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nCan’t you hear the blacktop callin’?\nClassroom clock is stuck or stallin’\nThere is nothing that will pass the test \nUnless it’s recess\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the second and third pre-chorus endings, the lyrics expand out beyond the tedium of the elementary school classroom to the wonder of the outside world:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nOne more dotted I\nOne more crossed T \nThen we’ll be runnin’ free\nThere is more beauty in this world than you can guess\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That last line resonates powerfully with me. Seeing the beauty in this world is something children do naturally. I think we forget how to, as we get older, and our knowledge of history and current events expands, and our experience of life evolves from dreaming of what our lives might be to actually living them day-to-day. Our dreams get smaller and more finite as time passes. As we get older still, we relearn to see the beauty, in a different way—with a wonder that is tinged with sadness. As an adult, I see that the splendor and joy of the world is counterbalanced by its disappointments and horrors.</p>\n\n<h2>The world is at least fifty percent terrible, and that’s a conservative estimate, though I keep this from my children</h2>\n\n<p>The line “There is more beauty in this world than you can guess” always makes me think of the contrasting sentiment expressed in the poem <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/89897/good-bones\">“Good Bones” by Maggie Smith</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nGood Bones\nBY MAGGIE SMITH\n\nLife is short, though I keep this from my children.\nLife is short, and I’ve shortened mine\nin a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,\na thousand deliciously ill-advised ways\nI’ll keep from my children. The world is at least\nfifty percent terrible, and that’s a conservative\nestimate, though I keep this from my children.\nFor every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.\nFor every loved child, a child broken, bagged,\nsunk in a lake. Life is short and the world\nis at least half terrible, and for every kind\nstranger, there is one who would break you,\nthough I keep this from my children. I am trying\nto sell them the world. Any decent realtor,\nwalking you through a real shithole, chirps on\nabout good bones: This place could be beautiful,\nright? You could make this place beautiful.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a profoundly powerful poem that I read in college and have never forgotten. As an adult and a parent, I return to it often. It has always made me feel, in some way, like a teenager who concludes, upon first entering the adult world, that I have been sold a bill of goods: nothing is as nice or easy or fair as my parents and mentors (and, let’s face it, TV and movies) told me it would be. This poem distills all the disappointment and disillusionment that experience and maturity bring into seventeen simple and somewhat humorous lines. I love how it ends on a note that is somehow both cynical and hopeful: “You could make this place beautiful.”</p>\n\n<h2>Selling the world to my children</h2>\n\n<p>It’s my job, as a parent, to sell the world to my children. I want to tell them the good—now, while they are young—and the bad—later, when they are older. In both times, now and later, I have to remember that Justin Roberts and Maggie Smith are both right about the world. It contains all the beauty that has any meaning. It also contains all the horrors that have ever befell anyone. The most important thing I have to teach my children is that they can make it better—they just have to try, even after the veil of childhood innocence has fallen, and they see the world for what it really is.</p>\n",

				"title": "Premature Optimization",
				"content_html": "<p>In programming, there has long been a warning in computer science to avoid <a href=\"http://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization\">premature optimization</a>. Donald Knuth called it “the root of all evil”. I find myself thinking about this all the time—not so much while programming, but when I’m thinking of spending money on myself, or telling people how to spend their money on me, as for birthday or Father’s Day gifts.</p>\n\n<p>I’m at an age now where I have everything I would ever want. But…everything I have could still be a little bit better. To wit:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>I have awesome headphones that I love. I want better ones. And different ones.</li>\n    <li>I have a home server that is underpowered, but quiet and extremely reliable. I would love one with enough power to could run virtual machines, but I don’t really need it. </li>\n    <li>I have a clicky mechanical keyboard that I love. I want a better one—that lights up, unnecessarily, or has colorful keycaps.</li>\n    <li>I have an Apple wireless keyboard for my Mac. I want to replace it with the Apple Magic keyboard, even though I already have an Apple Magic keyboard for my iPad.</li>\n    <li>I have a Series 1 Apple Watch that I love. I would love, even more, a Faster Series 3. </li>\n    <li>Let’s not even talk about iPads and Macs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These few things are some of my material obsessions. What they have in common, for me, is that they have all been satisfied by things I already own, upgrading to newer or better versions would cost a lot of money (way more than anyone would spend in a gift for me), and the upgrade would be only marginally better than what I have, so I’m not sure if it would even make me happy.</p>\n\n<p>Despite knowing all this, I can’t stop thinking about upgrading what I have to something better.

				"content_text": "In programming, there has long been a warning in computer science to avoid <a href=\"http://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization\">premature optimization</a>. Donald Knuth called it “the root of all evil”. I find myself thinking about this all the time—not so much while programming, but when I’m thinking of spending money on myself, or telling people how to spend their money on me, as for birthday or Father’s Day gifts. \n\nI’m at an age now where I have everything I would ever want. But…everything I have could still be a little bit better. To wit:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>I have awesome headphones that I love. I want better ones. And different ones.</li>\n\t<li>I have a home server that is underpowered, but quiet and extremely reliable. I would love one with enough power to could run virtual machines, but I don’t really need it. </li>\n\t<li>I have a clicky mechanical keyboard that I love. I want a better one—that lights up, unnecessarily, or has colorful keycaps.</li>\n\t<li>I have an Apple wireless keyboard for my Mac. I want to replace it with the Apple Magic keyboard, even though I already have an Apple Magic keyboard for my iPad.</li>\n\t<li>I have a Series 1 Apple Watch that I love. I would love, even more, a Faster Series 3. </li>\n\t<li>Let’s not even talk about iPads and Macs.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThese few things are some of my material obsessions. What they have in common, for me, is that they have all been satisfied by things I already own, upgrading to newer or better versions would cost a lot of money (way more than anyone would spend in a gift for me), and the upgrade would be only marginally better than what I have, so I’m not sure if it would even make me happy.\n\nDespite knowing all this, I can’t stop thinking about upgrading what I have to something better. I always want to <em>optimize</em> my experience with the things I enjoy. But, until the things I have break down and are no longer useful, it is <em>too early</em> to upgrade them. Doing so would be indulging in <em>premature optimization</em>, which be wasteful, which is “the root of all evil” to me.\n\nSomeday, my headphones will break, my keyboards won’t be compatible with my computers, my server won’t support the OS I want to run, and Apple won’t support my hardware anymore. That’s when I will upgrade these things—after I have extracted every bit of their value. Until then, I will just daydream about, and feel a little guilty about obsessing about, premature optimization.\n",

				"title": "SwiftoDo Development Notes, March 2018",
				"content_html": "<p>Today I released the ninth update to <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com\">SwiftoDo</a> in about ten weeks. What is driving all these small (but good!) releases? Two main things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>I want the app to get better</li>\n    <li>I want to have fun</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>I want it to get better</h3>\n\n<p>SwiftoDo is a good app, but it is by no means perfect. There are a lot of things that can be improved. My development task list for the app is a mile long. For a long time, the most important items on that list were also the most difficult for me to implement. To be honest, some of those “most important” improvements <em>feel like</em> they are beyond my current capabilities as a developer—but that doesn’t mean that I can’t make improvements somewhere. The app can still get better.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, small things can make the app a lot better. Based on many emails with customers, I have learned that, a lot of times, a simple-to-implement feature, rather than a broad reimagining of a portion of the app, will make a big difference to their enjoyment of the app and the productivity they gain from it. That’s why I have been working on “small” features, such as the full file editor, that merely build on what was already there, but end up making the app more powerful and flexible for users. That is also my rationale behind improving application performance, which has become a much higher priority for me this year. Better performance benefits <em>everybody</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I also decided to release features and fixes regularly and frequently. Every week I ask myself, “How can you make the app better for your customers?” And, on another day each week, I ask myself, “Is my latest commit better than what my customers have?” Once I’m sure the new version is better than the last version, I release it.</p>\n\n<p>I figure that adding small features and fixing small bugs eventually accumulates, and my <em>good</em> app can eventually become a <em>great</em> app.</p>\n\n<h3>I want to have fun</h3>\n\n<p>I’m working on SwiftoDo because it the app is useful to me and because it is <em>fun</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Coding is fun for me, but certainly not every minute of it. Sometimes I have to fight with UIKit’s quirks or work around its bugs, which can take hours of frustrating work. Sometimes I fail to get a feature working without introducing a crash or breaking something else in the app. Sometimes things just don’t work, and it’s really hard to figure out why. Sometimes I’m stuck, and that’s no fun.</p>\n\n<p>I have decided not to remain stuck for more than a day or two anymore. If something isn’t working, I table the work and move onto smaller, solvable problems for a while. This philosophy has led me to work on features that seem simple, useful, and fun to code, but maybe not as important as the larger, more difficult things that have been blocking my progress. That explains why I’ve been pushing forward on improvements to the task text editor, for example, rather than adding new data providers. As a side benefit, working on those smaller things sometimes clears a way, either in the codebase or in my mind, to tackle those larger, more important items.</p>\n\n<p>So, what’s fun? Racking up win after win, week after week, by pushing a better version of my app out to my users. And knowing, every day, that no matter what is <em>not</em> in the app yet, what <em>is</em> in the app keeps getting better.</p>\n\n<h2>Version numbers</h2>\n\n<p>SwiftoDo’s version number, currently at 2.9.2, is heading into the weird-looking, double-digit-minor-version-number terrority. The next version I release will be 2.10.0.</p>\n\n<p>As Apple suggests, I’m using a 3-number <a href=\"https://semver.org\">semantic version numbering</a> system, with my own rules for what increments each component. Architectural changes to the app (such as a total rewrite) will bump the first number. Adding new user facing features will bump the second number. Fixing bugs or enhancing existing features, in minor ways, will bump the third number.</p>\n\n<p>Because I am releasing so often now, and batching fewer new user-facing features together, the minor version number has been increasing rapidly. No one should care what the version number is, as long as it goes up. I don’t really care if it is, eventually, version 2.50.0. I does look a little funny to me, though.</p>\n\n<h2>What about the Mac version?</h2>\n\n<p>I have not been releasing updates to <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com/desktop\">SwiftoDo Desktop</a> recently. The main reason for that is that SwiftoDo Desktop is, basically, feature complete. Unfortunately, because it is coded in Objective C and relies on cell-based table views (mainly for the inline editing to work), it sits at a technological dead end. A total rewrite is in order.</p>\n\n<p>I have prepared for this scenario. My todo.txt-related code is in a framework that can be ported over to the Mac easily.

				"content_text": "Today I released the ninth update to <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com\">SwiftoDo</a> in about ten weeks. What is driving all these small (but good!) releases? Two main things:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>I want the app to get better</li>\n\t<li>I want to have fun</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>I want it to get better</h3>\n\nSwiftoDo is a good app, but it is by no means perfect. There are a lot of things that can be improved. My development task list for the app is a mile long. For a long time, the most important items on that list were also the most difficult for me to implement. To be honest, some of those “most important” improvements <em>feel like</em> they are beyond my current capabilities as a developer—but that doesn’t mean that I can’t make improvements somewhere. The app can still get better.\n\nSometimes, small things can make the app a lot better. Based on many emails with customers, I have learned that, a lot of times, a simple-to-implement feature, rather than a broad reimagining of a portion of the app, will make a big difference to their enjoyment of the app and the productivity they gain from it. That’s why I have been working on “small” features, such as the full file editor, that merely build on what was already there, but end up making the app more powerful and flexible for users. That is also my rationale behind improving application performance, which has become a much higher priority for me this year. Better performance benefits <em>everybody</em>.\n\nI also decided to release features and fixes regularly and frequently. Every week I ask myself, “How can you make the app better for your customers?” And, on another day each week, I ask myself, “Is my latest commit better than what my customers have?” Once I’m sure the new version is better than the last version, I release it.\n\nI figure that adding small features and fixing small bugs eventually accumulates, and my <em>good</em> app can eventually become a <em>great</em> app.\n\n<h3>I want to have fun</h3>\n\nI’m working on SwiftoDo because it the app is useful to me and because it is <em>fun</em>. \n\nCoding is fun for me, but certainly not every minute of it. Sometimes I have to fight with UIKit’s quirks or work around its bugs, which can take hours of frustrating work. Sometimes I fail to get a feature working without introducing a crash or breaking something else in the app. Sometimes things just don’t work, and it’s really hard to figure out why. Sometimes I’m stuck, and that’s no fun.\n\nI have decided not to remain stuck for more than a day or two anymore. If something isn’t working, I table the work and move onto smaller, solvable problems for a while. This philosophy has led me to work on features that seem simple, useful, and fun to code, but maybe not as important as the larger, more difficult things that have been blocking my progress. That explains why I’ve been pushing forward on improvements to the task text editor, for example, rather than adding new data providers. As a side benefit, working on those smaller things sometimes clears a way, either in the codebase or in my mind, to tackle those larger, more important items.\n\nSo, what’s fun? Racking up win after win, week after week, by pushing a better version of my app out to my users. And knowing, every day, that no matter what is <em>not</em> in the app yet, what <em>is</em> in the app keeps getting better.\n\n<h2>Version numbers</h2>\n\nSwiftoDo’s version number, currently at 2.9.2, is heading into the weird-looking, double-digit-minor-version-number terrority. The next version I release will be 2.10.0. \n\nAs Apple suggests, I’m using a 3-number <a href=\"https://semver.org\">semantic version numbering</a> system, with my own rules for what increments each component. Architectural changes to the app (such as a total rewrite) will bump the first number. Adding new user facing features will bump the second number. Fixing bugs or enhancing existing features, in minor ways, will bump the third number. \n\nBecause I am releasing so often now, and batching fewer new user-facing features together, the minor version number has been increasing rapidly. No one should care what the version number is, as long as it goes up. I don’t really care if it is, eventually, version 2.50.0. I does look a little funny to me, though.\n\n<h2>What about the Mac version?</h2>\n\nI have not been releasing updates to <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com/desktop\">SwiftoDo Desktop</a> recently. The main reason for that is that SwiftoDo Desktop is, basically, feature complete. Unfortunately, because it is coded in Objective C and relies on cell-based table views (mainly for the inline editing to work), it sits at a technological dead end. A total rewrite is in order. \n\nI have prepared for this scenario. My todo.txt-related code is in a framework that can be ported over to the Mac easily. In fact, I have started and stopped a total rewrite of the Mac version a couple times now, but have never gotten that far into it. The things holding me back are:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>I have to update my knowledge of AppKit, which is the Mac’s UI framework.</li>\n\t<li>The desktop app uses a different filtering system, which is a little harder to use than the iOS version’s filtering system, but it is much more powerful. I don’t really want to kill it off.</li>\n\t<li>SwiftoDo on iOS could always use more work, and it represents 70% of my user base.</li>\n</ol>\n\nIn June, Apple <em>may</em> announce <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/01/31/apple-still-plans-combined-ios-mac-apps-in-2018/\">a new framework</a> that would allow me to port my iOS code to the Mac much more easily.

We are <em>far</em> from the world of mushy, sizzly 128kbps MP3 files now. That said, the lossless versions <em>do</em> sound a tiny bit better.

Otherwise, it sounds the same as the CD version. You gain about 1-2% in fidelity at the price of lot of extra bits on the hard drive, and, perhaps, more dollars out of your wallet. This is true even though the 24-bit version was mastered to be a little quieter than the original CD and iTunes versions. You have to turn it up a notch to match the others&rsquo; volume.

When I look at users whose avatars are photos of themselves, I suspect the percentage of people of color is also very small.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have been thinking about diversity on the platform since I started using it, the day it opened to the public in December 2017. Jean&rsquo;s essay inspired me to publish some of my thoughts.</p>\n\n<h2>What do we expect?</h2>\n\n<p>The Micro.blog service has not been a publicly available for long. At this point, it is understandable that the first wave of users would be primarily composed of fans of its founder, Manton Reece. Manton is an iOS and macOS developer who blogs and podcasts about his development work and the indie web. If you have come across his work online, you are probably very much like him: an iOS or macOS developer, or at least a passionate user; a tech podcast listener; or a passionate blogger or IndieWeb aficionado. This core group is, for reasons related to historical and cultural biases, <em>not</em> a particularly diverse one.</p>\n\n<p>This core group describes <em>me</em>, and certainly does not describe <em>everyone</em> on Micro.blog, but it does describe a lot of the users I found on the service&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://micro.blog/discover\">Discover</a> page. Manton and Jean have expressed, from the very beginning, an earnest desire to create a safe community of independent micro blogs—&rdquo;safe&rdquo; from the abuse that silences disempowered people, women, and minorities on dominant social media platforms. They, along with the users of the platform, have openly discussed how to increase diversity, and the challenges inherent in doing so. I have learned a lot from reading these blog posts and discussions. Like them, I wish for Micro.blog to attract and retain a more diverse user base. The question we all face now is: how?</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few ideas.</p>\n\n<h2>Recognize and publicize that community guidelines are intrinsic to the product</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://micro.blog/macgenie/325883\">Jean McDonald</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nNo one should feel unwelcome here.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This should be one of the public-facing mantras that applies to the entire project, much like &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be evil&rdquo; was to Google for many years. Jean&rsquo;s quote should be atop the &ldquo;Community Guidelines&rdquo; page, and a link to that page should be near the top of the &ldquo;help.micro.blog&rdquo; page.</p>\n\n<p>I think Micro.blog should put a lot more focus on the community guidelines and whatever technology or processes are used to enforce them. It&rsquo;s a key feature of the platform. People behaving <em>well</em> together is the core of the product for me, and a key differentiator between it and Twitter.</p>\n\n<h2>Refine the marketing message</h2>\n\n<p>What is Micro.blog, anyway? To <a href=\"https://indieweb.org\">IndieWeb</a> people, it&rsquo;s kind of obvious. To everybody else, maybe not.</p>\n\n<p>If asked, today, to sell it to someone, I might say: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the good parts of Twitter, with none of the bad parts.&rdquo; I might explain that microblogging is simply sharing something about yourself in public, and that Micro.blog is a <em>safe</em>, <em>respectful</em> place to do so, because it has protections against abuse, and strict community guidelines. If they are unsure why they should share thing in public, I would explain that it is <em>empowering</em> to do so. It is putting your best foot forward online.</p>\n\n<h2>Promote on podcasts</h2>\n\n<p>Having a simple, concise marketing message is essential, but that message needs to be spread somehow. One of the best ways to market these days is on podcasts.</p>\n\n<p>Manton has a <a href=\"https://coreint.org\">podcast</a> and a <a href=\"http://timetable.manton.org\">microcast</a>, which have brought a lot of people to Micro.blog thus far. I think podcasts are a great opportunity to promote the open, inclusive, but safe nature of Micro.blog. While podcast audiences may, as a whole, skew white, male, and wealthy, there <em>are</em> tons of podcasts out there that are hosted by, feature as panelists, and cater to women and minorities. I&rsquo;m sure that Manton is adjacent enough to other tech podcasters to get some guest spots on tech podcasts that feature or cater to these groups.</p>\n\n<h2>Ask users for help</h2>\n\n<p>Micro.blog users are all, at this point, early adopters, and most of us are especially committed to the platform and want it to succeed. Ask us to publicize the service. Give us some ideas how to do that effectively, and in ways that will increase diversity. Provide incentives for us to sign up new people, such as additional badges (which are free to provide) or free months of Micro.blog hosting (which of course incurs a cost). I&rsquo;m sure something will come of it.</p>\n\n<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>My list of suggestions is by no means exhaustive, and Manton and Jean are likely in a better position than I am to understand what they need to do, and what they can do. I do want to express that diversity is important for all of us, even white, male, Americans such as myself. If all people are treated with dignity and are allowed to participate in something (work, society, etc.), outcomes will be better, and life will be richer, for all of us. I have seen that firsthand at a small scale, and wish to see it at a much larger scale. Micro.blog is a good place to start.</p>\n",

Jean's quote should be atop the \"Community Guidelines\" page, and a link to that page should be near the top of the \"help.micro.blog\" page.\n\nI think Micro.blog should put a lot more focus on the community guidelines and whatever technology or processes are used to enforce them. It's a key feature of the platform. People behaving <em>well</em> together is the core of the product for me, and a key differentiator between it and Twitter.\n\n<h2>Refine the marketing message</h2>\n\nWhat is Micro.blog, anyway? To <a href=\"https://indieweb.org\">IndieWeb</a> people, it's kind of obvious. To everybody else, maybe not.\n\nIf asked, today, to sell it to someone, I might say: \"It's the good parts of Twitter, with none of the bad parts.\" I might explain that microblogging is simply sharing something about yourself in public, and that Micro.blog is a <em>safe</em>, <em>respectful</em> place to do so, because it has protections against abuse, and strict community guidelines. If they are unsure why they should share thing in public, I would explain that it is <em>empowering</em> to do so. It is putting your best foot forward online.\n\n<h2>Promote on podcasts</h2>\n\nHaving a simple, concise marketing message is essential, but that message needs to be spread somehow. One of the best ways to market these days is on podcasts.\n\nManton has a <a href=\"https://coreint.org\">podcast</a> and a <a href=\"http://timetable.manton.org\">microcast</a>, which have brought a lot of people to Micro.blog thus far. I think podcasts are a great opportunity to promote the open, inclusive, but safe nature of Micro.blog. While podcast audiences may, as a whole, skew white, male, and wealthy, there <em>are</em> tons of podcasts out there that are hosted by, feature as panelists, and cater to women and minorities. I'm sure that Manton is adjacent enough to other tech podcasters to get some guest spots on tech podcasts that feature or cater to these groups. \n\n<h2>Ask users for help</h2>\n\nMicro.blog users are all, at this point, early adopters, and most of us are especially committed to the platform and want it to succeed. Ask us to publicize the service. Give us some ideas how to do that effectively, and in ways that will increase diversity. Provide incentives for us to sign up new people, such as additional badges (which are free to provide) or free months of Micro.blog hosting (which of course incurs a cost). I'm sure something will come of it.\n\n<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>\n\nMy list of suggestions is by no means exhaustive, and Manton and Jean are likely in a better position than I am to understand what they need to do, and what they can do. I do want to express that diversity is important for all of us, even white, male, Americans such as myself. If all people are treated with dignity and are allowed to participate in something (work, society, etc.), outcomes will be better, and life will be richer, for all of us. I have seen that firsthand at a small scale, and wish to see it at a much larger scale. Micro.blog is a good place to start.\n",

I also learned, the hard way, that <em>lots</em> of minor UI-related bugs popped up when I changed the app’s target iOS framework from 9.0 to 11.0.

Therefore, I have been issuing new releases about once per week, the past few weeks. I will not be keeping up that release cadence, but I do want to reflect to my customers that the app is actively developed. More importantly, I want bugs to be fixed for all my users.

For some perspective, Dropbox’s SwiftyDropbox library, which powers file sync now, is a great library, but is also the source of most of the mysterious crashes on startup that a small number of people have reported. What is frustrating to me, as a developer, is that I can’t really fix those crashes, because I don’t fully understand what causes them, and the code is in a library. I don’t want to open my app up to more instability just to add a data provider.

				"title": "Plaintext Productivity: Still productive after all these years",
				"content_html": "<p>I am still using the <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net\">Plaintext Productivity</a> system that I wrote about in 2013. It is a productivity system, based primarily on plaintext files, for Microsoft Windows users. Since I published a few people have asked me to write an update to <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net\">Plaintext Productivity</a>. The fact is, the system has held up so well for me that I really don’t have any updates to report.</p>\n\n<p>One reason my system remains pretty much the same as it was in 2013 is that the operating system it is based on, <em><a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/index.html#why-is-windows-important-\">Windows</a></em>, despite some cosmetic changes, remains pretty much the same as it was in 2013. Sure, it got a better UI when Windows 10 supplanted Windows 7 and 8, but Windows still <em>works</em> just as well and just as poorly. Another pillar of the system, <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com\">Sublime Text</a>, also had a design change recently, to display more crisply on high-DPI screens, but it, too, works pretty much the same as it did in 2013.\n<h2>A little bit of history</h2>\nI developed my <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net\">Plaintext Productivity</a> system slowly over the years, as a result of the limitations I faced on my relatively locked down work computers, and my frustration with third party productivity apps going out of business and disappearing over the years. Gradually, I stripped down my productivity system to <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com\">a great text editor</a> and a <a href=\"https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt\">todo.txt-format</a> task list (with <a href=\"http://benrhughes.github.io/todotxt.net/\">a good client</a>), with some clever ideas about using a <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/2-09-work-journal.html\">journal</a> for planning, and for <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/3-00-files-introduction.html\">managing files</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Because I was stuck on Windows, an operating system I did not particular like, I had to make do with built-in functionality, portable apps that I could sneak onto my system, and a universal file format: plaintext. Even this was challenging. Windows, for all it’s ubiquity, has a dearth of good <em>third party</em> (non-Microsoft) software for it. There is a lot of crapware in the Windows Store, several world class apps from Adobe that everyone knows about, and not that much in between. Macintosh, iOS, and to a far lesser extent, Android, have attracted the attention on small, boutique publishers and indie developers who have contributed great plaintext-based apps. <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com\">Like me</a>.\n<h2>Notes and drafts</h2>\nI still firmly believe in <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/2-00-notes-and-drafts-introduction.html\">writing lots of notes and drafts</a> to help document thoughts as well as meetings. I draft emails, write planning documents, write out procedures for work I have to repeat, and so on. I also keep a <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/2-09-work-journal.html\">work journal</a> every day (well, I’m not perfect about writing it <em>every</em> single day, but I try). At the start of each workday, I write a short journal post to plan my top activities for the day. At the end of each workday, I wrote an even shorter journal entry to help remind me where I left things, which sets me up for the next day. I set up calendar entries to remind me to do these journal entries. These activities help keep me, a person who works remotely and alone, organized, engaged with my work, and on task throughout the day.\n<h2>My text editor</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com\">Sublime Text</a> is still my favorite Windows text editor. It is even better than when I first bought it, over five years ago, and it was worth every penny. I love that it is lean, fast, flexible, and handles both my short notes and huge data files with aplomb. Its plugin system makes it a serviceable Markdown editor. I have syntax highlighting for Markdown, HTML, todo.txt, TaskPaper, and the various programming languages I use at work: ACL scripts (which I created myself), SQL, C#, VBScript, and Python (and there are far more available).</p>\n\n<p>Best of all, in my opinion, are its numerous, well-defined keyboard shortcuts for shifting lines around, selecting words, selecting whole lines, deleting whole lines, and so on. Its support for multiple text selection and multiple cursors makes certain quick edits, like making a bunch of lines a bullet list in Markdown, a snap; it’s actually kind of mind blowing when you get used to it. Lastly, I=its find and replace functionality is incredibly powerful as well, considering it supports regular expressions.</p>\n\n<p>I have found no compelling reason to switch it out for a newer, shiner app—which is the whole point of having a simple productivity system in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>I should say, though, that I do use Editorial or Ulysses on my iPad as a sidekick text editor quite frequently. I started to do so for a non-software related reason: my work machine’s mechanical keyboard is so loud that it bothers people on conference calls, while my iPad’s keyboard—the Apple Magic Keyboard—is so quiet that my phone does not pick it up. Those iOS apps are fantastic, but they are not vital to my Plaintext Productivity system.\n<h2>My task list</h2>\nI still <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/1-00-tasks-introduction.html\">use todo.txt for my work task list</a>. Since I wrote Plaintext Productivity, I contributed a ton of patches to my favorite Windows todo.txt app: todotxt.net. I contributed multiple task selection and editing, and a lot of other things. I went on to write Mac and iOS todo.txt apps, <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com/desktop\">SwiftoDo Desktop</a> and <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com\">SwiftoDo for iOS</a>. I tend to use SwiftoDo for iOS most of the time, and revert to todotxt.net only when I don’t want to context-switch away from my PC to my iPad or iPhone. My todo.txt file is synced via Dropbox between all these apps, so it doesn’t really matter which app I use at any given moment.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt\">Todo.txt</a> is the best system for me because my work, and my GTD-inspired way of looking at my work, tends to present itself as a large number of tasks that get picked up, dropped, and re-prioritized frequently. I have started to dabble with <a href=\"https://www.taskpaper.com\">TaskPaper</a> for some of my planning needs, either in my daily work journaling, or when I have a self-directed project to plan, such as drafting a proposal or creating a software-based audit tool. TaskPaper is interesting, but I do too much sorting and filtering of tasks throughout the day for it to supplant todo.txt as my main task list system.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t keep track of every task in my life in todo.txt, however. I prefer to keep my personal tasks separate from my work ones, mainly because I find having them commingled with work tasks distracts me from my work. Therefore, I keep my personal tasks in <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205890\">Reminders</a>, which has had solid Siri support and cross-Apple-device syncing since 2011, and has only gotten better since then. I <em>have</em> changed a lot about how I managed non-work tasks since 2013, but those fall outside my Plaintext Productivity system.\n<h2>Filing and searching</h2>\nI still use the same <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/3-00-files-introduction.html\">filing system</a>, too, and have been consistently happy with it.

				"content_text": "I am still using the <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net\">Plaintext Productivity</a> system that I wrote about in 2013. It is a productivity system, based primarily on plaintext files, for Microsoft Windows users. Since I published a few people have asked me to write an update to <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net\">Plaintext Productivity</a>. The fact is, the system has held up so well for me that I really don’t have any updates to report.\n\nOne reason my system remains pretty much the same as it was in 2013 is that the operating system it is based on, <em><a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/index.html#why-is-windows-important-\">Windows</a></em>, despite some cosmetic changes, remains pretty much the same as it was in 2013. Sure, it got a better UI when Windows 10 supplanted Windows 7 and 8, but Windows still <em>works</em> just as well and just as poorly. Another pillar of the system, <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com\">Sublime Text</a>, also had a design change recently, to display more crisply on high-DPI screens, but it, too, works pretty much the same as it did in 2013.\n<h2>A little bit of history</h2>\nI developed my <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net\">Plaintext Productivity</a> system slowly over the years, as a result of the limitations I faced on my relatively locked down work computers, and my frustration with third party productivity apps going out of business and disappearing over the years. Gradually, I stripped down my productivity system to <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com\">a great text editor</a> and a <a href=\"https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt\">todo.txt-format</a> task list (with <a href=\"http://benrhughes.github.io/todotxt.net/\">a good client</a>), with some clever ideas about using a <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/2-09-work-journal.html\">journal</a> for planning, and for <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/3-00-files-introduction.html\">managing files</a>.\n\nBecause I was stuck on Windows, an operating system I did not particular like, I had to make do with built-in functionality, portable apps that I could sneak onto my system, and a universal file format: plaintext. Even this was challenging. Windows, for all it’s ubiquity, has a dearth of good <em>third party</em> (non-Microsoft) software for it. There is a lot of crapware in the Windows Store, several world class apps from Adobe that everyone knows about, and not that much in between. Macintosh, iOS, and to a far lesser extent, Android, have attracted the attention on small, boutique publishers and indie developers who have contributed great plaintext-based apps. <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com\">Like me</a>.\n<h2>Notes and drafts</h2>\nI still firmly believe in <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/2-00-notes-and-drafts-introduction.html\">writing lots of notes and drafts</a> to help document thoughts as well as meetings. I draft emails, write planning documents, write out procedures for work I have to repeat, and so on. I also keep a <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/2-09-work-journal.html\">work journal</a> every day (well, I’m not perfect about writing it <em>every</em> single day, but I try). At the start of each workday, I write a short journal post to plan my top activities for the day. At the end of each workday, I wrote an even shorter journal entry to help remind me where I left things, which sets me up for the next day. I set up calendar entries to remind me to do these journal entries. These activities help keep me, a person who works remotely and alone, organized, engaged with my work, and on task throughout the day.\n<h2>My text editor</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com\">Sublime Text</a> is still my favorite Windows text editor. It is even better than when I first bought it, over five years ago, and it was worth every penny. I love that it is lean, fast, flexible, and handles both my short notes and huge data files with aplomb. Its plugin system makes it a serviceable Markdown editor. I have syntax highlighting for Markdown, HTML, todo.txt, TaskPaper, and the various programming languages I use at work: ACL scripts (which I created myself), SQL, C#, VBScript, and Python (and there are far more available).\n\nBest of all, in my opinion, are its numerous, well-defined keyboard shortcuts for shifting lines around, selecting words, selecting whole lines, deleting whole lines, and so on. Its support for multiple text selection and multiple cursors makes certain quick edits, like making a bunch of lines a bullet list in Markdown, a snap; it’s actually kind of mind blowing when you get used to it. Lastly, I=its find and replace functionality is incredibly powerful as well, considering it supports regular expressions.\n\nI have found no compelling reason to switch it out for a newer, shiner app—which is the whole point of having a simple productivity system in the first place.\n\nI should say, though, that I do use Editorial or Ulysses on my iPad as a sidekick text editor quite frequently. I started to do so for a non-software related reason: my work machine’s mechanical keyboard is so loud that it bothers people on conference calls, while my iPad’s keyboard—the Apple Magic Keyboard—is so quiet that my phone does not pick it up. Those iOS apps are fantastic, but they are not vital to my Plaintext Productivity system.\n<h2>My task list</h2>\nI still <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/1-00-tasks-introduction.html\">use todo.txt for my work task list</a>. Since I wrote Plaintext Productivity, I contributed a ton of patches to my favorite Windows todo.txt app: todotxt.net. I contributed multiple task selection and editing, and a lot of other things. I went on to write Mac and iOS todo.txt apps, <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com/desktop\">SwiftoDo Desktop</a> and <a href=\"https://swiftodoapp.com\">SwiftoDo for iOS</a>. I tend to use SwiftoDo for iOS most of the time, and revert to todotxt.net only when I don’t want to context-switch away from my PC to my iPad or iPhone. My todo.txt file is synced via Dropbox between all these apps, so it doesn’t really matter which app I use at any given moment.\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt\">Todo.txt</a> is the best system for me because my work, and my GTD-inspired way of looking at my work, tends to present itself as a large number of tasks that get picked up, dropped, and re-prioritized frequently. I have started to dabble with <a href=\"https://www.taskpaper.com\">TaskPaper</a> for some of my planning needs, either in my daily work journaling, or when I have a self-directed project to plan, such as drafting a proposal or creating a software-based audit tool. TaskPaper is interesting, but I do too much sorting and filtering of tasks throughout the day for it to supplant todo.txt as my main task list system.\n\nI don’t keep track of every task in my life in todo.txt, however. I prefer to keep my personal tasks separate from my work ones, mainly because I find having them commingled with work tasks distracts me from my work. Therefore, I keep my personal tasks in <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205890\">Reminders</a>, which has had solid Siri support and cross-Apple-device syncing since 2011, and has only gotten better since then. I <em>have</em> changed a lot about how I managed non-work tasks since 2013, but those fall outside my Plaintext Productivity system.\n<h2>Filing and searching</h2>\nI still use the same <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/3-00-files-introduction.html\">filing system</a>, too, and have been consistently happy with it. While I believe that you should rely on search rather than elaborate folder structures for finding what you need to, Windows Search <em>still</em> is not great. Despite its weaknesses, and the frustrations those weaknesses sometimes cause, I still get by with it.\n<h2>Hardware and other things</h2>\nI also wrote about <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/4-05-hardware.html\">hardware</a> and <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net/4-00-other-tips.html\">other things</a> in Plaintext Productivity.

				"content_html": "<p>One thing to do when you’re supposed to be writing is to fuss about your writing environment.</p>\n\n<h2>Not wasting time</h2>\n\n<p>Choosing the perfect writing font is a classic way to procrastinate—but it is not a waste of time. Fonts are important. A good font is not only highly legible, it also conveys a subliminal emotional effect on the reader. Naturally, it follows that it will also have similar effects on the writer. A good font will make you feel better while you are writing—maybe because you can read it more easily, or because you find elements of it, its curves or serifs, aesthetically pleasing. Whatever the reason, picking a font that is pleasing can have a profound effect on your writing.</p>\n\n<h2>What makes a good writing font?</h2>\n\n<p>For me, as a writer and programmer who began typing text on a computer in the 1980s, I gravitate toward <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font\">monospaced fonts</a>. Every character in a monospaced font has the same width. This is useful in programming or for data files, because, in those uses, you often want to align columns of text. It is not useful at all in typesetting books, of course; text laid out in monospace fonts looks primitive and wide-open. Primitive and wide-open, however, are perfect attributes for text that I am writing, breaking apart, moving around, and recombining. Writing in monospaced fonts is, on a subconscious level, freeing. It helps me feel like nothing in my text is set in stone.</p>\n\n<h2>Considerations</h2>\n\n<p>Whether the font is monospaced or proportional is only part of what is important. Other things matter, too: the shapes of the characters; whether they have serifs or not; whether some look identical to others (l vs. 1, or O vs. 0, for example); and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond that, some fonts <em>render</em> better on screen than others. For example, Verdana and Georgia were commissioned by Microsoft specifically to be look good, clear, and legible <em>on screens</em>, rather than on paper. This was revolutionary at the time, as was their free-to-use licensing. Consequently, these two fonts were adopted almost everywhere on the web for a while. Georgia is still one of the eight font options in Apple’s iBooks ebook reader.</p>\n\n<p>Your particular display and operating system have a lot to do with what font looks good. In general, displays are much higher resolution and much higher quality now than when Verdana and Consolas were invented. As you might expect, this means that all all scalable fonts look better on modern, high-resolution displays. Still, some fonts will look much sharper than others on some displays. For example, on my Dell 27” 4K display for my work machine, a Windows 10 laptop, Consolas looks the best for the terminal and any coding I am doing, and Sax Mono looks better for writing actual documents. These fonts don’t offer similar advantages to me on my Mac or on iOS, however. They look fine, but they really pop for me on my work machine.</p>\n\n<h2>My favorite writing fonts over the years</h2>\n\n<p>There are tons of monospaced fonts available.

I tend to use only a few at a time, depending on which one looks best on my hardware and software at the moment. Below, I highlight two of my favorite, very much related, fonts for writing these days: Plex and iA Writer Duospace.</p>\n\n<h2>IBM’s Plex</h2>\n\n<p>IBM released <a href=\"https://ibm.github.io/type/\">Plex</a>, an open source font that will be used in all of IBM’s published materials going forward, in late 2017. It isn’t the only open source font that’s free for anyone to download and use, but it is a really good one. Plex Mono, its monospaced variant, looks fantastic on my iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Its edges are crisp, and the stroke has a consistent width; it looks like the lines fit just right in the pixel grid that makes up the screen.</p>\n\n<h2>iA Writer Duospace</h2>\n\n<p>The iOS development company iA took IBM’s Plex Mono and tweaked it a little bit to make it even better, in their opinion, for writing. They kept the font monospaced <em>except for M’s and W’s</em>. It’s a pretty simple change, but a lot of thought went into it. <a href=\"https://ia.net/topics/in-search-of-the-perfect-writing-font/\">iA Writer’s article about this process</a> is absolutely fascinating—I highly recommend reading the whole thing.</p>\n\n<p>The resultant font, iA Writer Duospace, looks great on my MacBook Pro. I prefer Plex Mono on my iPad and iPhone, though. There is something about the wider W and M that looks different in the two platforms. It could just be that my iOS screens are a lot smaller, and width is at a greater premium. It could also just be that I prefer my letters to line up vertically, especially when my text is constrained to a narrow column.</p>\n\n<h2>Perfect, for now</h2>\n\n<p>For now, I am very happy writing in Plex and iA Writer Duo on my Apple devices. I still happily use SaxMono and Consolas on the PC for writing notes and coding, though Plex Mono is starting to creep into use for my todo.txt file and in other places. Every year or two I look for something better, but I probably won’t change from these four main fonts until I get new hardware, which could change how everything is rendered, but that is probably a long way off.</p>\n",

It nails the basics, and allows you to customize its editor and its tag and folder system to fit your specific needs—it just takes a little time (and, maybe, some JavaScript skills, for some things) to do so.</p>\n\n<h2>Drafts is where text begins</h2>\n\n<p>Drafts, by Agile Tortoise, isn’t exactly an unknown app. On the contrary, it is one of the crown jewels of the iOS platform. It is one of the few apps with an in-app purchase tip jar that I actually threw money in—a few times, actually. Drafts makes my life simpler, in little ways, every day. Like one of my other favorite writing apps, Ulysses, it is a pleasure to use.</p>\n\n<p>Drafts is primarily meant for quick text entry, and then pushing that text to another app for processing or storage. For example, I type most calendar entries and Google searches in Drafts (which is in my home screen toolbar) and, in two taps, open them for processing in Fantastical or Safari (which are not in my toolbar). Drafts 4, which has been out quite a while now, expands on that basic idea, and delivers a very useful utility and a top-notch text editor.</p>\n\n<h2>Not just for automation—for writing!</h2>\n\n<p>Drafts is already well known for its automation capabilities. It is great for drafting a tweet and posting it to Twitter (either natively or via another app), or for writing out a calendar entry and pushing it to <a href=\"https://flexibits.com/fantastical-ipad\">Fantastical</a> or <a href=\"https://readdle.com/products/calendars5\">Calendars 5</a> for parsing. What it is not well known for—but should be—is that it is the most customizable text editor on iOS. <a href=\"http://omz-software.com/editorial/\">Editorial</a> has long held that crown, thanks to its its support of snippets and extensibility with Python scripts. Drafts, however, outdoes Editorial when it comes to customizing the editor itself, which has a profound effect on  <em>writing</em> experience.</p>\n\n<p>In Drafts, <em>actions</em> can change the text your are writing, send some or all of it to another app, turn on/off night mode within the app, and so on. You can download actions from <a href=\"https://drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com\">the developer’s extensive library</a>, of, if you are a bit of a programmer, you can them yourself in JavaScript, from within the app. You can assign these actions to the main menu, which is accessible from the top-right icon, or from a swipe to the left. That’s the basic stuff. You can <em>also</em> assign these actions to a custom toolbar that is displayed over the keyboard. Even better, for hardware keyboard users, you can assign your own hardware keyboard shortcuts to these actions, too. No other iOS app that I use does this!</p>\n\n<p>I use Drafts on my iPad primarily for writing notes, such as when I get a phone call or am in a meeting. I use my custom toolbar buttons to input today’s date, paste text, format headings and lists in Markdown, send various lines (text selections) to my todo.txt file (via Dropbox), and so on. At the end of my writing session, I send the entire note to Dropbox for storage.</p>\n\n<p>Notes don’t have to be exported, however. They can stay in Drafts and sync to all your other iOS devices via iCloud. You can also organize them there. There are three basic folders—Inbox, Archive, and Trash—to put notes into. You can flag notes for future retrieval, and filter them them by folder, flag status, and keywords (search terms within the note text) into custom “folders” or saved searches as well. I have not switched over to using Drafts as a full-fledged notes app (most of my drafts get automatically deleted after 30 days in the Trash folder), but I am thinking about it.</p>\n\n<h2>Drafts in the future</h2>\n\n<p>Drafts 4 has been around for a while now. Drafts 5 is coming, someday, with even more features: TaskPaper editing is a feature that I am looking forward to. I expect the pricing model to change from paid upfront to a subscription; I will be happy to pay for it, as a valuable companion to <a href=\"https://ulyssesapp.com\">Ulysses</a> for writing, and a valuable sidekick to practically every other app in the iOS ecosystem.</p>\n",

And, I abandoned them and went back to Twitter, despite its flaws. So did everybody else.\n<h2>Why is Twitter so sticky, and nothing else is?</h2>\nWhat makes Twitter is valuable not what it does—microblogging is relatively easy to implement these days—but <em>who is on it</em>: Famous people! Intellectuals! Politicians! Journalists! These people and many more are not only publishing there, but reading there, too. Communication with, and between, influential people there can be two-way, and is usually in public, which is fascinating to read and unlike any other communications platform that had come before it. Twitter can amplify the voice of the non-famous and non-published people, too—the under-represented—which is often great.\n<h2>Why is Twitter described as a cesspool?</h2>\nSometimes, though, amplifying under-represented voices is <em>not</em> great. Some voices are under-represented because they are malicious: Racists! Nazis! Liars! Sexist doxxers! Spammers! Russian bots! Malicious people have unique incentives to exploit and abuse a communications platform like Twitter. First, simply <em>having</em> a medium and a platform to spread their message is unique to them, because these people have been barred or banned elsewhere from spreading their message. Second, access to this new platform may be fleeting, because they could be banned there, too, for the same reasons they have been banned elsewhere. Third, people who want to spread malice are not the type of people who are concerned with preserving the health of the platform’s community, or the platform’s reputation in the wider world. Therefore, they can destroy the platform in the process of spreading their message.\n<h2>Why can’t Twitter fix this?</h2>\nThe world is too complex to separate people, or Twitter users, into good and bad actors. What is unpopular or under-represented today may be celebrated tomorrow; it may be true and worth spreading today. Understandably, Twitter doesn’t want to choose who gets to speak on their platform. Therefore, they tolerate hate speech on their platform to a degree that makes some of their users angry. It puts the company in a difficult position when hate speech is broadcast (retweeted) by the President of the United States, as it was this week.</p>\n\n<p>I understand Twitter’s problems as a company. It needs eyeballs on it to sell ads. Controversy on the platform, and the sheer number of active users (whether they are real people or bots), lead to greater traffic, greater revenue, and greater return on investment for their investors—at least in the short run. In the long run, however, poisonous speech on the platform poisons the platform.\n<h2>What to do about it, as a Twitter user?</h2>\nBasically, it is hard to see how, as users, we can improve Twitter. Twitter, the company, owns the platform. Consequently, it has the sole power to fix its flaws. Improvements to blocking and reporting abuse that Twitter has implemented have not satisfied the users who need them the most.</p>\n\n<p>Moving away from Twitter entirely, onto another, similar platform, can work for small communities who primarily wish to communicate amongst themselves. It is unlikely, however, that a critical mass of influential users—the celebrities, journalists, etc., who make the platform valuable—will move to a different platform at this point. Without those users, another platform, however superior from a technical or community management standpoint, would not have as much value.</p>\n\n<p>As a Twitter user, you really have two choices now: live with the abusive users, and report and block them as well as you can; or, if Twitter abuse is bothering you enough (or worse, threatening to your safety), stop using Twitter entirely.

				"content_html": "<p>At the end of last year, I quit using RSS. It was a big step for me. I had been using RSS practically since it first became available. My first <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">RSS</a> reader was the <a href=\"http://sagerss.com\">Sage</a> plugin for FireFox, which I started using in 2004. I subscribed to <a href=\"www.slate.com\">Slate</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lifehacker.com\">LifeHacker</a>, a couple other professional publications, and a fairly large number of personal blogs, covering topics ranging from technology, economics, and personal finance to cooking and television shows. I was obsessive about skimming my feed many times a day, reading every headline, and often every article, of Slate and my favorite blogs.</p>\n\n<p>I eventually dropped Sage for <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader\">Google Reader</a>, and used it, and later Feedly, as a back-end to whatever smartphone RSS reader I was using. For years I checked my feeds a dozen times a day, read a ton of articles (though not all of them, as I used to), and generally felt pretty happy with the experience.\n<h2>Why I quit using RSS</h2>I stuck with RSS <em>long</em> after I became a habitual Twitter user, long after I started to see articles linked to from Twitter before they hit my RSS reader, and long after most technology writers and podcasters started disparaging RSS as some antiquated technology that, like dial-up internet service, was hopelessly out of date.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, though, I quit using RSS—not because it was uncool, but because it was no longer making me happy. Like those writers and podcasters said, the basic need RSS fulfilled for me—keeping current, and entertained with fresh reading material—<em>was</em> being fulfilled by other services. Twitter did so more timely, and with more commentary from the writers. News aggregators, such as Apple News, did so with a slicker visual style. (I am emphatically <em>not</em> a regular Facebook user, so I miss out on whatever is going on there.)</p>\n\n<p>I thought these services were more hip, modern, and fun than RSS. Most importantly, I thought they were keeping me <em>more current</em>. After all, for a long time, my RSS reader (the wonderful <a href=\"#\">Reeder app for iOS</a>) fed me the same articles that I had already seen on Twitter. Worse, it fed me five or six different publications’ takes on the same subject every day, which was interesting a few days of the year (such as when reviews of new Apple devices hit the streets), but was otherwise completely redundant.\n<h2>What I missed without RSS</h2>After a year RSS-free, I started to think something was missing. I was literally missing articles that I would like to read, especially those from bloggers I liked, such as <a href=\"http://ericasadun.com\">Erica Sadun</a> and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net\">John Gruber</a>, because they would pass by in the timeline before I would see them. I was missing bloggers’ voices in general, because most of my Twitter list (like everybody’s, I’m sure) is heavily <em>news</em> related. I could keep up with what the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com\">New York Times</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com\">Washington Post</a> are publishing each day pretty well; but what about what <a href=\"http://www.manton.org\">Manton Reece</a> and <a href=\"http://marginalrevolution.com\">Tyler Cowlin</a> are publishing? Their voices were being buried in my Twitter feed by the daily (hourly?) news cycle.</p>\n\n<p>Without RSS, I missed the spirit of the independent web: all those individuals and small publications who are sharing knowledge and expressing opinions that don’t fit into 140 characters, or even 280.\n<h2>Back to RSS (and Atom, and JSON Feed)</h2>After many months away from it, I realized that RSS wasn’t the problem—I was. I wasn’t using RSS in a way that made me happy. Worse, I supplanted it with Twitter, which both sucked up all my attention every day, and reduced my attention span for content to 140 characters (a length perfect for snipes and jabs and headlines, but insufficient for most cogent thoughts). Fortunately, RSS has not died since the rise of Twitter and Facebook. It has quietly remained a fundamental internet technology, undergirding nearly every online publishing platform. Many, many sites support it without advertising it the way they used to ten years ago. Luckily, any good client can find feeds using just the site URL.</p>\n\n<p>Not only RSS is still there: my longstanding RSS software is still there, too. Like in 2013, I am using <a href=\"http://reederapp.com/ios/\">Reeder</a> on iOS as a front end, and <a href=\"https://feedly.com/\">Feedly</a> as a back end. Reeder has been around almost as long as the App Store. It is rarely updated, but it just works. It’s simplicity, elegance, and stability make it one of the finest apps on the platform. Feedly, the back end service that actually checks my feeds, is a free service that I basically never look at. I don’t use their website. I don’t use their app. I don’t really know or care how they make money off of me. It, like Reeder, is solid, stable, and just works.\n<h2>Using RSS with a different perspective</h2>After returning to my RSS reader after such a long break, I had thousands of unread items and dozens of subscriptions. I decided to start over, so I unsubscribed to all my feeds, and started thinking about what I really wanted to get out of RSS, and, in general, out of the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to use RSS differently now. I no longer need it to drink the content firehose and keep current with the minute-by-minute news cycle; Twitter is available for that, for good or ill. Instead, RSS enables me to follow a few interesting voices on the Internet, read their actual, in-depth thoughts, and not miss anything they have to say.</p>\n\n<p>To these ends, I no longer follow big media sites. Primarily, I follow blogs: <em>real</em> blogs, written by actual people, rather than published by massive organizations. I’m mostly following Apple-focused tech bloggers and Swift programmers, which reflects my favorite hobbies—but that’s just what I’m doing for now. Lastly, I’m not checking my RSS feeds a hundred times per day. I am checking only a one or two times per day, and often I don’t have any updates. Instead of adding more feeds, I just accept it now.

				"title": "What makes you love or hate a smartphone?",
				"content_html": "<p>I wonder this, as smartphones are maturing into what may be their final form: bezel-less slabs of glass with high-res screens, microphones, and sensors, that all look pretty much the same. The iPhone 8, for example, is the fourth generation of iPhone with the same basic form factor. A few years back, this would have been unheard of. A few years from now, though, I wouldn’t be surprised if there still is a “legacy” iPhone out there with this form factor, discounted several hundred dollars below what the iPhone X form-factor phone of the day will cost.</p>\n\n<p>If all smartphones have the same basic shape, does it even matter which one you have? I think it does. You can still hate one phone and love another with the same case design. There are other things that matter, beyond the obvious distinction in operating system and/or Android skin. My experience with the iPhone 6S vs. the iPhone 7 is a case in point.</p>\n\n<h2>Nearly identical phones can be vastly different</h2>\n\n<p>Last September, I traded in my one-year-old iPhone 6S Plus for an iPhone 7 Plus, though Apple’s iPhone upgrade program. I hadn’t originally intended to do this. I had always kept my phones for two full years, and I chose the iPhone upgrade plan to get a nice monthly payment that also included AppleCare+.</p>\n\n<p>The reason why I upgraded last year is that, after a year with it, I decided that I <em>hated</em> the iPhone 6S Plus. My 6S Plus was <em>fine</em>, and I never had any problems with the hardware or software, but I never really liked it, for several reasons. First, it was big, and I wasn’t used to big phones at that point. Second, it was ugly: the space gray aluminum finish was dull and drab. Third, it was ungainly: not only was it a large phone that strained my hand and my pockets, but its edges were smooth and slippery. Its Apple leather case was awful, too: it had mushy, hard to distinguish buttons, and its patina became slick and unpleasant after only a few months of wear. (Yes, I know the leather case is <em>not</em> the phone, but as it was an Apple product released alongside the phone, I think it is fair to include it in my assessment here.)

				"content_text": "I wonder this, as smartphones are maturing into what may be their final form: bezel-less slabs of glass with high-res screens, microphones, and sensors, that all look pretty much the same. The iPhone 8, for example, is the fourth generation of iPhone with the same basic form factor. A few years back, this would have been unheard of. A few years from now, though, I wouldn’t be surprised if there still is a “legacy” iPhone out there with this form factor, discounted several hundred dollars below what the iPhone X form-factor phone of the day will cost.\n\nIf all smartphones have the same basic shape, does it even matter which one you have? I think it does. You can still hate one phone and love another with the same case design. There are other things that matter, beyond the obvious distinction in operating system and/or Android skin. My experience with the iPhone 6S vs. the iPhone 7 is a case in point.\n\n<h2>Nearly identical phones can be vastly different</h2>\n\nLast September, I traded in my one-year-old iPhone 6S Plus for an iPhone 7 Plus, though Apple’s iPhone upgrade program. I hadn’t originally intended to do this. I had always kept my phones for two full years, and I chose the iPhone upgrade plan to get a nice monthly payment that also included AppleCare+.\n\nThe reason why I upgraded last year is that, after a year with it, I decided that I <em>hated</em> the iPhone 6S Plus. My 6S Plus was <em>fine</em>, and I never had any problems with the hardware or software, but I never really liked it, for several reasons. First, it was big, and I wasn’t used to big phones at that point. Second, it was ugly: the space gray aluminum finish was dull and drab. Third, it was ungainly: not only was it a large phone that strained my hand and my pockets, but its edges were smooth and slippery. Its Apple leather case was awful, too: it had mushy, hard to distinguish buttons, and its patina became slick and unpleasant after only a few months of wear. (Yes, I know the leather case is <em>not</em> the phone, but as it was an Apple product released alongside the phone, I think it is fair to include it in my assessment here.) The phone’s camera and software ecosystem were great, but it didn’t feel good in my hand, and that is crucial to how attached you can get to a handheld device.\n\nWhile I grew to hate the iPhone 6S Plus, I quickly grew to love the iPhone 7 Plus.

Using this phone has been my chance to reacquaint myself with Android after a six year break, which was, in many ways, more interesting to me than testing out a phone with a cutting-edge, “bezel-less” design.</p>\n\n<p>My last Android device was a Motorola Droid, running CyanogenMod’s version of Android Froyo. By the time I was able to upgrade to an iPhone 4S, in 2011, I wanted to throw the Droid against the wall. While it had lots of cool apps and was packed with features, it was so unreliable that I could barely make calls or take pictures with it any more. The iPhone, in comparison, seemed restrained and tasteful in design, fast and efficient in processing, and 100% reliable. What it lacked in customizability, it gained in simplicity and stability.</p>\n\n<h2>What happened to Android in the past six years?</h2>\n\n<p>Stock Android has changed less than I expected since my days running CyanogenMod on my Droid. When I unboxed the Essential phone, I was surprised right away that Google’s phone setup process was essentially unchanged since 2011. It worked well then, though, and it worked just as well today.</p>\n\n<p>That same “it if ain’t broke, don’t fix it” attitude has been applied to be base Android OS features, too: the home screen, notification shade, app drawer, and so on were pretty much unchanged as well. Again, they are functional, and, unlike on iOS, <em>replaceable</em> by third party software; understandably, improving them must be a low priority for Google.</p>\n\n<p>Android’s largest transformation since 2011, at least from a user’s perspective, is the introduction of Material Design. Google introduced Material Design in 2014 as the default design language on Android. It is, undoubtedly, an improvement over what had come before, but its principles are not universally applied, and don’t necessarily make apps easier to use in every case.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t think Material Design has had a big effect on how Android apps are designed or used. Some indie developers never bothered to adopt it. Even on apps from big companies with large, talented, and nimble development teams, screen layouts are still dominated by hamburger buttons and slide-out menus, which leads to tedious navigation between parts of an app, and low discovery of key features. Also, sharing information between apps is still run through the same kind of share sheets used in 2011, which, ironically enough, can’t be customized as much as iOS share sheets can.</p>\n\n<p>After a month or so of Android use, I concluded that Android runs more smoothly on high-end hardware than it did five years ago, but it is practically unchanged from a user experience perspective. As an iOS user, this is shocking, because iOS is <em>completely</em> different than it was in 2011.</p>\n\n<h2>Where has iOS been all this time?</h2>\n\n<p>Back when I used the Droid, Android was <em>way ahead</em> of Apple for many software features: the notification shade, quick settings on the notification shade, text selection, voice input, customizability, and, most of all, app extensibility (data sharing between apps, mostly) were <em>way better</em> on Android than on iOS. It would be fair to say that, in terms of user-facing features, iOS had a lot more ground to cover than Android did to improve <em>certain aspects</em> of user experience. My assessment now, with an Essential Phone and an iPhone 7 Plus at my disposal, is that Apple’s slow and steady advancement of iOS has allowed it to catch up to Android in all these areas, and exceed it in many of them.</p>\n\n<p>The overall user interface design on iOS changed significantly in iOS 7, and has been refined and expanded upon in each iOS release since. Apple stole good user interface ideas from Android, such as the notification shade and the control center, but designed them differently and refined them each year, and implemented its own means of app extensibility in iOS 8, which has been slowly expanding in capabilities and usefulness year by year. An extensive number of indie developers’ embrace of x-callback-url for app extensibility has been a huge driver of inter-app communication and automation. App extensions, introduced by Apple in iOS 8, have matured into a cohesive ecosystem that does wonders for various workflows, especially those involving text and images. Apple’s Files app in iOS 11 allows third party storage providers, such as Dropbox, to have first-party-level integration with the OS and any apps that support the Files API. It is actually simple and seamless to use Dropbox with all sorts of iOS apps that were not written to support it. In this regard, Android is stuck in the same world as iOS 11 and earlier, where file service can be integrated, but each integration feels looser, more like a bolt-on feature or an afterthought.</p>\n\n<p>It’s easy to think that iOS has been stagnant for many years because you still can’t arrange your app icons in arbitrary patterns on the screen, or change your default email app. If you can look beyond those customization points, you will see an enormous evolution in design and functionality on iOS, which is unmatched on the Android side.</p>\n",

				"title": "Contexts in Getting Things Done and todo.txt",
				"content_html": "<p>One of the great insights of the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done\">Getting Things Done</a> (GTD) system is that tasks not only have projects, but contexts as well. A context is, basically, a thing or place or situation you need in order to do a task. Examples include: @home, @work, @phone, @computer, @errands, and so on. With projects and tasks, you can visualize your task list as a two-dimensional grid, with one row per project, and one column per context. This helps you determine what your next action should be. You can only do the tasks that are in the context you are currently in. That’s great, right?</p>\n\n<h2>What good is a context when I have everything at hand at all times?</h2>\n\n<p>Well&hellip;what I have found is that the typical set of contexts outlined in the “Getting Things Done” book are not really that useful to me. I only use my task list for work, so I’m always “@work”. I do all my work on a computer, which is portable, so I’m always “@computer”. I always have my mobile phone on me, so I’m always “@phone”. After diligently typing out these contexts in my todo.txt file and later ignoring them, for a long, long time, I realized that doing so was pointless.

				"content_text": "One of the great insights of the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done\">Getting Things Done</a> (GTD) system is that tasks not only have projects, but contexts as well. A context is, basically, a thing or place or situation you need in order to do a task. Examples include: @home, @work, @phone, @computer, @errands, and so on. With projects and tasks, you can visualize your task list as a two-dimensional grid, with one row per project, and one column per context. This helps you determine what your next action should be. You can only do the tasks that are in the context you are currently in. That’s great, right?\n\n<h2>What good is a context when I have everything at hand at all times?</h2>\n\nWell...what I have found is that the typical set of contexts outlined in the “Getting Things Done” book are not really that useful to me. I only use my task list for work, so I’m always “@work”. I do all my work on a computer, which is portable, so I’m always “@computer”. I always have my mobile phone on me, so I’m always “@phone”. After diligently typing out these contexts in my todo.txt file and later ignoring them, for a long, long time, I realized that doing so was pointless. I only work in one context, so why bother to track it?\n\n<h2>A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds</h2>\n\nThis was not immediately obvious to me because I was trying really hard to be a faithful GTD practitioner, and do everything that entails completely and correctly.

				"title": "Comparing todo.txt and TaskPaper formats",
				"content_html": "<p>I am a huge fan of managing my tasks using <a href=\"http://plaintext-productivity.net\" title=\"I even wrote a guide about it!\">plaintext</a> files. I mostly use todo.txt, but I have recently learned about the TaskPaper format. This is what I have learned about both formats.</p>\n\n<h2>Both formats</h2>\n\n<p>Both todo.txt and TaskPaper formats are, of course, plaintext files. You can open them in any text editor on any platform. There are several clients available on each of the major computing platforms specifically built to handle them. None of the clients controls your data or is able to lock you in. You are free to organize your task list any way you wish, and even to have multiple task list files. Both formats offer different ways to define projects and tasks, and both have some kind of tagging support, which helps in filtering tasks. You can also have multiple task list files, though most clients work with only one file at a time. Last, but not least, you are on your own when it comes to syncing your task list across systems. Dropbox is the most common third-party file sync service.</p>\n\n<h2>Todo.txt</h2>\n\n<h3>File format</h3>\n\n<p>Todo.txt is a simple flat-file format—just a list of tasks, <a href=\"https://github.com/todotxt/todotxt/\">in a particular format</a>—that was initially built for command-line querying. It acts as a junk drawer that you can throw stuff into and easily get out later through sorting, filtering, and searching. It is for the sort of person who, for example, archives all their email into one folder, figuring it can be found later with search, rather than those who file every message into an elaborate folder tree. It works for me because I tend to have dozens, and sometimes hundreds, of tasks at a time, spread across a variety of projects, with only minor dependencies between them.</p>\n\n<h3>App ecosystem</h3>\n\n<p>There are many todo.txt compatible apps on all the major platforms. I created <a href=\"http://swiftodoapp.com\">SwiftoDo</a> (iOS) <a href=\"http://swiftodoapp.com/desktop/\">SwiftoDo Desktop</a> (macOS), which are todo.txt apps highly focused on filtering and sorting tasks, and allowing for easy updating and reprioritizing. On Windows, <a href=\"https://github.com/benrhughes/todotxt.net\">todotxt.net</a> is my favorite client. I sync them all via <a href=\"https://db.tt/CKgdD5kQ\" title=\"My Dropbox affiliate link\">Dropbox</a>. As long as you have a good client, like the ones I mention above, the todo.txt format is especially good for entering and managing large amounts of tasks, and rapidly reprioritizing them.</p>\n\n<h2>TaskPaper</h2>\n\n<h3>File format</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://support.hogbaysoftware.com/t/where-is-taskpapers-file-format-defined/2098?u=jessegrosjean\">TaskPaper format</a> is much simpler than todo.txt’s format. It is a multi-level outline that includes support for tags and notes&hellip;and that’s it. It uses tags for just about everything: project, context, priority, due date, completed status, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Because it is an outline, I find that the TaskPaper format is superior to todo.txt for <em>planning</em>—either project planning or simple day planning in my work journal. Having different outline levels makes it easy to see how tasks are grouped, ordered, and inter-dependent.</p>\n\n<p>These strengths as an outliner are weaknesses, for me at least, when it comes to working through my task list, finding my next actions, and adjusting priorities to reflect what I need to work on next. The outline and order of tasks feels fixed in TaskPaper files, and it feels somewhat unnatural to sort and filter them. It is possible to flag all of the tasks to do today with a <code>@today</code> tag and filter the file to show them. I prefer to work with one very short TaskPaper file for the day, containing only the few tasks I plan to do that day, and mark tasks complete as the day progresses.</p>\n\n<h3>App ecosystem</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.taskpaper.com\">TaskPaper’s</a> macOS app is, as you would expect from the creator of the file format, the gold standard TaskPaper editor. It is clean, well thought-out, and deceptively simple. It has powerful outlining and filtering features that I admire, and extensive keyboard shortcuts that cover everything.</p>\n\n<p>Because I have to work on Windows, I mostly use a bastardized version of TaskPaper format in <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com\">Sublime Text</a>, using the <a href=\"https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks\">PlainTasks</a> plugin. <a href=\"http://omz-software.com/editorial/\">Editorial</a> on iOS is the best mobile app I have found that supports the format. It looks like the next version of <a href=\"https://agiletortoise.com/drafts/\">Drafts</a> will do so in the near future, as well. In my opinion, outside macOS, you are best off using a text editor for TaskPaper files.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Both todo.txt and TaskPaper are useful tools in the plaintext toolbox. I use todo.txt to manage all my tasks, but I use TaskPaper to plan new projects or to outline priorities for my workday.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Last year, prior to Apple’s announcement of the iPhone 7, I had hoped for the “all-screen” design that was announced last week for the iPhone X. I was sure that would be my next phone. Now that it is here, one year later, I am not sure if I want it—at least not yet.</p>\n\n<p>As an iPhone Upgrade Plan customer, I have three options at my disposal:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>Do nothing, upgrade to something new next year, keep my iPhone 7, and give it to one of my kids, put it in a drawer, or sell it for peanuts in 2018.</li>\n    <li>Pre-order the iPhone 8 Plus, which would presumably be available soon, as the most rabid Apple fans will prefer to skip it and get the X. I would have to turn in the iPhone 7 around month 12 or 13 of my 24-month payment plan.</li>\n    <li>Wait until next month and pre-order the iPhone X via the iPhone Upgrade Plan. I would likely have to wait a couple months for the phone to be available (probably January). I would have to turn in the iPhone 7 around month 15 of my 24-month payment plan.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Cost: the main reason to skip the iPhone X for me</h2>\n\n<p>The iPhone X starts at $999. The model with more storage that I would buy is $150 more, and AppleCare Plus costs about $200 on top of that. That represents a huge outlay for the phone. I don’t begrudge Apple for pricing the iPhone X so high, or other people for buying it without worrying about its cost. The high price is, however, a hint that the X may not be for me—at least not this year.</p>\n\n<h2>Additional switching costs of an early upgrade</h2>\n\n<p>While I love the idea of “renting” a smartphone with a fixed monthly cost (hardware as a service), it doesn’t really work that way. You actually have to buy the phone, and deal with the downsides that entails.</p>\n\n<p>When I upgraded to the iPhone 7, I was surprised that I would have to pay 100% of the taxes on the new phone (about $100), plus a fee to activate it on my Verizon account (about $20). I had been thinking only about the difference in the monthly phone payment I would make, which was minuscule, and the expected cost to buy a new, compatible case. I was out over $100 for the new phone, and realized that I had already paid those costs one year earlier for the 7, and was giving up that hardware completely. On top of that, the case cost a lot, too (about $50). It is easy to forget about these costs when (1) the cost of the phone dwarfs them, and (2) the main cost of the phone is a relatively small monthly payment.</p>\n\n<p>This year, wiser about the switching costs, I am just not sure if it is worth it to go from the 7 to the 8 Plus or X.</p>\n\n<h2>Other reasons why I am iffy on the X</h2>\n\n<p>Coming from the Plus, the iPhone X actually represents a step down in screen size (though it has a higher native resolution), lacks Touch ID, and has a smaller battery. I am not sure how my apps will look on the iPhone X screen. I bet developers will have to figure out how best to handle the notch and curved corners. (I am a little worried about my iOS app, <a href=\"http://swiftodoapp.com\">SwiftoDo</a>, too.) Face ID might be slower or less convenient than Touch ID.

I’m sure demand for it will be rather low, by iPhone standards. I would actually be able to get one soon. It is at least $300 cheaper than the iPhone X. The model I want costs $949, which is really expensive, but my monthly iPhone Upgrade Plan payment would not change.</p>\n\n<h2>What to do?</h2>\n\n<p>If money were no object, I would buy the X outright sometime soon and never use the iPhone Upgrade Plan again. Because that is not the case, I am leaning most heavily towards skipping an upgrade this year. I will deal with decreasing battery life and knowing I don’t have the best camera or performance anymore, but I will not suffer much. Or, I may just order the iPhone 8 Plus and not worry about the X until next year. I will go to an Apple Store in the next few weeks to test my resolve.</p>\n",

Or, I may just order the iPhone 8 Plus and not worry about the X until next year. I will go to an Apple Store in the next few weeks to test my resolve.\n",

Fortunately, operating stability tends not to be a problem these days. What is a problem, however, is the sheer number of apps you can end up having installed, and the many notifications that come with them.</p>\n\n<h2>An app strategy</h2>\n\n<p>The App Store started out with a Unix-like philosophy about software. Remember the phrase “there’s an app for that?” Most apps did one thing. Most people do a lot of things, so we end up with a whole lot of apps. Not much has changed over time. Springboard, the launcher on iOS, is deliberately primitive. All your apps are spread out across various home screen pages. Once you have more than two or three pages, it is really hard to remember where all your apps are. Apps can be grouped into folders, but once in folders they are harder to find, unless you have a good organizational strategy.</p>\n\n<p>With a new device, such as my new iPad Pro, I simply don’t install apps unless I need them right then. For those apps that get installed, I reduce their notifications to a bare minimum. If you get notifications on your phone, and you always have your phone with you, do you really need them on your iPad? Probably not.</p>\n\n<p>Even after doing these smart-sounding things, I have 72 applications on my iPad Pro (and this is a machine with zero games on it!). Because of this, I often use Spotlight search to launch apps. I do this on my iPhone, too, where it feels inferior to tapping an icon. I’m learning, however, that on the iPad, just as on my Mac, it’s the right way to do it.</p>\n\n<p>(I probably use about ten productivity apps most of the time, and those apps will likely be in the Dock once I install iOS 11, but I still use at least 20 of those other apps on a daily basis for reading, scanning, and videos.)</p>\n\n<h2>How do you launch an app on an iPad?</h2>\n\n<p>With the keyboard, just like on a Mac. Simply hit Command+Space to launch Spotlight, type the first few letters of an app&rsquo;s name, and hit Enter. Without a hardware keyboard, pull down on the home screen to launch Spotlight, and type with the onscreen keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>This behavior is fast and efficient. As a side benefit, it <em>drastically</em> reduces the need to organize apps efficiently on the SpringBoard.</p>\n\n<h2>Home screen organization with activity-based folders</h2>\n\n<p>I tried briefly to <em>not</em> organize the Springboard at all, but I ended up with several pages of apps and it looked like a jumbled mess. So I went into the other direction: I put <em>everything</em> into folders, all of which fit on one screen.

Unless I have more than 16 apps in a folder, all the icons are visible at once, and their order does not matter to me.</p>\n\n<p>My Dock contains the six apps I use all the time throughout my work day: Safari, Overcast, Music, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swiftodo-desktop-task-list-for-todo-txt/id1143641091?ls=1&amp;mt=12\">SwiftoDo</a> (my todo.txt task list), Drafts, and Ulysses.

				"title": "Choosing an iPad Pro Case and Stand",
				"content_html": "<p>Having given up on a keyboard case, I felt adrift in subpar options for an iPad stand and case. I admit, it is not that hard to get something decent; most people would just buy an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071JNCDSN/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B071JNCDSN&amp;linkId=18e43bde2b382e5972069112e934f266\">Apple Smart Cover</a> (or a decent knockoff) and be done with it. I, however, wanted something very specific, something I had in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012VOP2QO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B012VOP2QO&amp;linkId=c89ff7b8355ddaf1ea8315de933294ad\">my old iPad Air 2 case</a>, which is apparently rare: a kickstand.</p>\n\n<p>The reason is that the kickstand made my iPad feel rock solid. It never moved or wobbled on a table. It never fell down because the folded up case collapsed beneath it. It felt real and solid, like a high quality tool rather than a fragile slice of glass and metal.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HIS30OY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01HIS30OY&amp;linkId=e7e97bd9bf7377f3fa85da4e0954bdd7\">Logitech Create</a> keyboard case (which I didn&rsquo;t like) had a kickstand, but nothing else I could find at the Apple Store or on Amazon did. Apple&rsquo;s Smart Cover seemed expensive and far worse as a stand than what I had for my old iPad. There was a charging stand, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1LTI3L/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01M1LTI3L&amp;linkId=40e05b6371265d10c8f40d9fe4ef40c3\">Logi Base</a>, that looked like a good, sturdy platform, but was overpriced, had a number of unfavorable user reviews, and was not a case at all, so it was an incomplete solution. I basically didn&rsquo;t want to spend so much on either case or stand, but after lots of thinking and comparison shopping, I bit the bullet and bought them both. I am very happy I did.</p>\n\n<h2>An extravagance, but a nice one</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1LTI3L/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01M1LTI3L&amp;linkId=40e05b6371265d10c8f40d9fe4ef40c3\">Logi Base</a>, once you get over the initial cost of it, is unexpectedly great. It&rsquo;s a stand that charges the iPad through the Smart Connector. Unlike a folded-up Smart Cover, it is rock solid. It basically sticks to the desk, and provides the iPad a secure backing. You can bang the screen with your fingers and it would not move. That, for me, is key. A wobbly iPad feels like a toy. A secure one feels like the future of computing.</p>\n\n<p>Docking and undocking are simple: a strong magnet helps keep everything in place. Charging through the Smart Connector works just fine.

				"content_text": "Having given up on a keyboard case, I felt adrift in subpar options for an iPad stand and case. I admit, it is not that hard to get something decent; most people would just buy an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071JNCDSN/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B071JNCDSN&amp;linkId=18e43bde2b382e5972069112e934f266\">Apple Smart Cover</a> (or a decent knockoff) and be done with it. I, however, wanted something very specific, something I had in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012VOP2QO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B012VOP2QO&amp;linkId=c89ff7b8355ddaf1ea8315de933294ad\">my old iPad Air 2 case</a>, which is apparently rare: a kickstand. \n\nThe reason is that the kickstand made my iPad feel rock solid. It never moved or wobbled on a table. It never fell down because the folded up case collapsed beneath it. It felt real and solid, like a high quality tool rather than a fragile slice of glass and metal. \n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HIS30OY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01HIS30OY&amp;linkId=e7e97bd9bf7377f3fa85da4e0954bdd7\">Logitech Create</a> keyboard case (which I didn't like) had a kickstand, but nothing else I could find at the Apple Store or on Amazon did. Apple's Smart Cover seemed expensive and far worse as a stand than what I had for my old iPad. There was a charging stand, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1LTI3L/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01M1LTI3L&amp;linkId=40e05b6371265d10c8f40d9fe4ef40c3\">Logi Base</a>, that looked like a good, sturdy platform, but was overpriced, had a number of unfavorable user reviews, and was not a case at all, so it was an incomplete solution. I basically didn't want to spend so much on either case or stand, but after lots of thinking and comparison shopping, I bit the bullet and bought them both. I am very happy I did. \n\n<h2>An extravagance, but a nice one</h2>\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1LTI3L/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01M1LTI3L&amp;linkId=40e05b6371265d10c8f40d9fe4ef40c3\">Logi Base</a>, once you get over the initial cost of it, is unexpectedly great. It's a stand that charges the iPad through the Smart Connector. Unlike a folded-up Smart Cover, it is rock solid. It basically sticks to the desk, and provides the iPad a secure backing. You can bang the screen with your fingers and it would not move. That, for me, is key. A wobbly iPad feels like a toy. A secure one feels like the future of computing.\n\nDocking and undocking are simple: a strong magnet helps keep everything in place. Charging through the Smart Connector works just fine. Numerous product reviewers complained that charging is slow and doesn't support fast charging. Perhaps that is true, but charging is fast enough to keep up with battery use, and then some, which is all I actually need. \n\nThe final thing that delights me about the Base is that it actually gives me a place for the Pencil. It has a tiny amount of ledge space in front of the iPad that is just big enough for the Pencil to rest on its side. There is just enough magnetism there (it is near the Smart Connector) to keep the Pencil there rather safely.\n\n<h2>Necessary protection</h2>\n\nWhile a stand is nice for desktop use, you still should have something to protect the iPad's screen sometimes.

				"content_html": "<p>When iOS 11 and the new iPad Pro were announced at this year&rsquo;s WWDC, I was very excited and more than a little confused. I was excited because the hardware looked fantastic, and I knew I was going to buy one. I was confused because iOS 11 made me no longer know what the iPad was for.</p>\n\n<h2>Excitement</h2>\n\n<p>Long before WWDC 2017, I decided I would use some of the earnings from my <a href=\"http://swiftodoapp.com\" title=\"SwiftoDo\">iOS app</a> and <a href=\"http://swiftodoapp.com/desktop\" title=\"SwiftoDo Desktop\">Mac app</a> (todo.txt task lists, under the name SwiftoDo) to upgrade my iPad Air 2 to the newest model—whatever Apple would release next. I had hopes for a larger-screen, smaller bezel iPad, which ended up being the 10.5&rdquo; iPad Pro.</p>\n\n<p>Even though the tech press has decried slow iPad sales for years now, I absolutely <em>love</em> the iPad. I use one for music, podcasts, videos, writing, Twitter, web browsing, and reading at least 8 hours every day. (It helps that I work from home.) I love the screen. I love the touch interface. I love driving it with a Bluetooth keyboard. I love how native apps can deliver a superior experience to web pages. I even love <em>developing</em> apps for the platform.</p>\n\n<p>Since I purchased my 2013 MacBook Pro, I have bought three iPads (not counting the Pro model I was considering) and zero MacBook Pros. This year I was not really due for an upgrade, but I use the iPad so much, I decided it was worth it.</p>\n\n<h2>Confusion</h2>\n\n<p>Despite my general iPad Pro excitement, I was also confused, because iOS 11 looked to me like a <em>computer</em> operating system, rather than a <em>tablet</em> operating system. iOS 11&rsquo;s new app launching dock, file-oriented architecture, and extensive drag-and-drop support gave me the impression that it made the iPad more like the next generation of Mac, rather than a tablet.</p>\n\n<p>This is important because, to me, and iPad is way more intimate a product than a computer. I read on it at the breakfast table and in bed. I listen to music all day at work, and sometimes just have it display a big clock or the blank text area of a note-taking app. These are things I would never dedicate an entire laptop to. But a tablet is small, low power, and low stress.</p>\n\n<p>I installed a developer beta of iOS 11 on my iPad Air 2 to get an idea of how the new UI worked. I also visited my local Apple Store to look at the 10.5&rdquo; iPad Pros the day they were released. I actually walked right right past them; the store had replaced all the 9.7&rdquo; models with 10.5&rdquo; models, and I could barely tell the difference. After a minute I found the 2017 9.7&rdquo; iPad (the new budget/consumer model) and a new 2017 10.5&rdquo; iPad Pro side by side. The difference in size was more slight than I had imagined. The larger size was obviously an improvement over my iPad Air 2 screen, but it didn&rsquo;t feel like a big enough difference to warrant an upgrade. I was actually a little upset, because I really wanted to upgrade to the newest iPad, but the 10.5&rdquo; model did not seem much better than the iPad Air 2.</p>\n\n<h1>A surprising decision (at least to me)</h1>\n\n<p>What dawned on me at the Apple Store was that iOS 11 would make the 12.9&rdquo; iPad Pro, which I had previously thought was ridiculously oversized, very attractive. With a keyboard, it would be a much better <em>desktop computer</em> than the 10.5&rdquo; model. Without a keyboard, and indeed without a case, it would light enough to hold while reading in bed, and not really too large for that either. It would have better software and require less maintenance than my MacBook Pro, and would be a lot more fun to use. So I played with one for a while and decided to buy it.</p>\n\n<p>Now I&rsquo;m writing this blog post on it, and plan to write more about the other hardware I bought to go along with it, and the changes I made to its software. It&rsquo;s a wonderful device, and is clearly, with iOS 11 on the horizon, the next iteration of the Mac.</p>\n",
