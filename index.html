			 <p>I’ve had my Nintendo Switch for about 5 years. My kids started playing it six months ago, and they play <em>a lot</em>. This week, the Joycons developed drift and are now useless. It thought I may have avoided that problem, but maybe it’s inevitable. Time to buy another Pro Controller.</p>

			 <p>A couple new, paid (or optionally paid) search engines have caught my attention recently: <a href="https://kagi.com">Kagi</a> and <a href="https://neeva.com">Neeva</a>. I am trying to figure out if switching to either of them, and paying for a search engine for the first time, makes sense for me.</p>
<p>The main problem with search engines—and Google is the prime example of this right now—is that search results are often worse in quality than they were five or ten years ago. This is because their algorithms have been gamed with SEO, so site creators can make more money, and the search engines themselves have junked up their results listings with ads and promotions for their own properties, so they can make more money.</p>
<p>At this point, I don&rsquo;t trust Google or Bing to order search results in a way that is beneficial to me, rather than to their partners and their paying customers: advertisers. Paying a subscription for search would, theoretically, align the search engine&rsquo;s interests with my own.</p>
<p>Kagi and Neeva promise aligned incentives and a more personalized search experience with higher-quality results. Both have iOS apps, which are web browsers that default to their own search engines. Both allow for sign-in with Apple, which allows me to hide my email address/real identity from them, if I choose to. Both have  Safari extensions that hijack the address bar search (even on iOS).</p>
<p>I have tested out Neeva the most. I really like its AI-generated summaries of the top few results pages. Kagi is clean and much faster. I find it hard to judge which is better, per se. I think I&rsquo;m finding what I want on the first page or so. I think I prefer Neeva&rsquo;s AI summary to Kagi&rsquo;s lack of one. The summaries are not always that impressive, though; it seems to pull one sentence out of the top three search result pages and smoosh them together into a paragraph.</p>
<p>One thing I have discovered is that I spend a lot less time looking at search engine results pages than I thought I did. Most of my use of the browser search bar ends with me clicking an autocomplete suggestion—one that is handled by DuckDuckGo, rather than Neeva or Kagi. (This is due to limitations in the default search engines in Safari.)</p>
<p>It probably makes sense for me to wait until Google, Bing, and whoever else integrate AI summaries into their offerings and re-evaluate all the search engines again. The Internet rumor mill suggests that change will come fairly soon.</p>

As far as I know, it is the only vocal jazz/standards album John Coltrane ever made. John Hartman has a deep, silky voice that&rsquo;s so good I am surprised I never heard of him before.</p>

This is purported to be one of the greatest albums of the 1990s, and a foundation for the dream pop and shoegaze subgenres. I never listened to it before today. I liked it but didn&rsquo;t love it enough to keep it in my library. I think its genre may not be for me.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/01/the-last-of-us-video-game-hbo-show-episode-3/672889/">Ian Bogost&rsquo;s essay</a> comparing the TV adaptation of <em>The Last Of Us</em> to its video game forbear was a good read. I especially enjoyed his thoughts about what content makes sense in a video game vs. a television series.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fully buy his argument that video game storytelling is inherently inferior to other media. It works differently, which I don&rsquo;t think the author fully realizes. At one point, when descriving his experience playing <em>The Last of Us</em> (the video game), he states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t shake the sense that the combat was getting in the way of the story, acting as filler, just there to give me something to do in between metered doses of narrative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Video game narratives are compelling, even if they are shallower than television or movie narratives, because you, the player, are put into the shoes of the protagonist. You are not watching a story happen to someone else; the story is happening to you—and it is happening right now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it doesn&rsquo;t matter that all the actions you perform in a video game may fall into a video game trope, like first-person shooter-style combat or even quick-time events. That stuff <em>is</em> the game. Gameplay, not story, is the essential element of video games. In the best games, the <em>gameplay</em>, more than the narrative, is what sparks your imagination, even after you&rsquo;ve stopped playing. The experience sticks with you because you did it. The story sticks with you because it happened to you.</p>

			 <p>One thing that has been making me happy lately is <a href="https://radioparadise.com">Radio Paradise</a>, which is an Internet radio station. Several things about it make it special:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is completely ad-free. It runs on the public radio model, in that it is listener-supported. A DJ breaks in between songs a couple times an hour to say hello and remind listeners that they can donate. These breaks never annoy me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its &ldquo;Main Mix&rdquo; is <em>the best</em> eclectic rock radio station I have ever listened to. The songs played on this station range from huge hits to album tracks I have never heard of. It has no pretentious or underground vibe: whatever is playing is always interesting,  musical, and accessible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It streams high quality audio. I listen to its AAC 320 Kbps stream, because my Apple devices support it. There is also a lossless FLAC stream, if your hardware can play it. Most Internet radio I listen has much worse audio quality, like 64 Kbps or (if you&rsquo;re lucky) 128 Kbps MP3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its web player is great, it has apps for many platforms if you want them, and it can be streamed from third-party Internet radio apps as well.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I highly recommend giving it a try.</p>

			 <p>I think that widescreen 16:9 presentation slides look worse than 3:2 ones. Text gets too wide to read comfortably. Some people divide their slides into two areas side-by-side, like they are two slides in one, which also isn’t good. Those are too busy, I think.</p>

			 <p>My monthly “don’t have a lawn that embarrasses me” budget has increased dramatically over the past few years. It has gone from a good buy (about $30/week) to eye-wateringly expensive (a little over $100/week). Part of the increase is that we changed lawn services from a company that did a poor job to one that did a good job. I have tried to shop around for a cheaper, but still good, service, but haven&rsquo;t found one yet. My wife doesn’t want us to revert back to the old, not-so-good lawn service we used to use. Even if we did, I’m sure we would get a much higher rate than we used to, because prices have increased all around.</p>
<p>Since this summer, I have been bandying about the idea of mowing my own lawn again (it’s been 10 years since I last did, when my mower broke). This week I decided that, by next spring, I will buy a good electric mower and make time to mow my own lawn each week. Despite having to buy a mower, which could cost $700-$800, I wills till save hundreds of dollars per month for a relatively small amount of my time.</p>
<p>It’s true that I won’t be able do as good a job as the service does with edging and weeding, but I don’t care. I will also have to figure out how to buy and use herbicide, which is the main secret to a non-embarrassing lawn in my area; I think I can do it. It will feel good to know that I am saving money. I also think it will feel good—most weeks, at least—to get a little more sunshine and exercise each week.</p>

			 <p>I read <em>Greenlights</em> by Matthew McConaughey last night. I picked it because it was the first nonfiction book I found in <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby">Libby</a> that I thought would be fun to read on a quiet night. I first heard about the book from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh_XIz9XJDw">an interview McConaughey did with Bill Maher</a> where I initially thought Maher didn&rsquo;t like him. I am a fan of McConaughey&rsquo;s acting and his positive attitude, though i am not always sure if he really has a coherent philosophy. (This book didn&rsquo;t help in that regard.)</p>
<p>The book contains some entertaining stories, including his stint in Australia, but my overall impression is that McConaughey led a charmed life, thanks in large part to being handsome and lucky in his youth, and rich and famous in his middle age. His book emits, elides, or spins into positive any negative experiences he had in his life, which is his point about &ldquo;red&rdquo; and &ldquo;yellow lights&rdquo; becoming &ldquo;greenlights&rdquo;, but it does leave a shallower impression of who he is and what he has learned from life.</p>

			 <p>I <em>love</em> using <a href="https://petl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">PETL</a> to read, transform, and validate datasets. Its API is simple and straightforward to use, and its documentation, while not perfect, is really good. Unfortunately, PETL’s data processing—especially loading data into SQL Server—is very slow—to the point of being completely unusable for anything but the smallest datasets.</p>
<p><a href="http://odo.pydata.org/en/latest/overview.html">Odo</a> promises to be much faster at data loads, and seems dead-simple to use, but I cannot get it to work. It turns out that the package hasn’t been updated in five years, which is why it will not work with the modern Python version I am using. I just wasted an hour on it and will probably give it up completely.</p>
<p>I can’t find any other ETL tools that will do the data load for me. I have to rely on the SQL Server Import/Export Wizard, which usually works and is fast but is a one-shot thing because I don’t have SQL Server Integration Services at my disposal.</p>
<p>I suppose I will either have to fork Odo, get it working, and figure out how to get my fork of Odo into my project, or I will have to write my own import routine using SQL Alchemy. Both seem difficult to me and not worth the trouble. I’m not the database administrator on my project—I’m supposed to be the data analyst!</p>

			 <p>The chess cheating scandal <em>du jour</em> is puzzling and fascinating. Matteo Wong’s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/09/carlsen-niemann-chess-cheating-poker/671472/">article in <em>The Atlantic</em></a> does not really unpack the issue, but instead provide some depth into how computers have changed the game over the past 25 years:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What once seemed magical became calculable; where one could rely on intuition came to require rigorous memorization and training with a machine. Chess, once poetic and philosophical, was acquiring elements of a spelling bee: a battle of preparation, a measure of hours invested.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is interesting, though understandable from a technological standpoint, that the concern in the 1990s was that a person might help the computer engine cheat. Today, conversely, the concern is that a computer engine (combined with some spycraft tech, it must be said) might help person cheat.</p>

			 <p>Over the weekend I wrote a SQL Server stored procedure and some user-defined functions it relies on that cleaned up data and inserted it into a new table. It was the sort of thing that took a short time to write, but an awfully long time to execute and to troubleshoot. It gave me an opportunity to learn more about using SQL Server’s “Include Actual Execution Plan” and “Include Live Query Statistics” features, which helped point me in the direction of creating an index that supposedly sped the whole process up by 30%.</p>
<p>The first version of my load script ran for 9.5 hours, and then bombed because it tried to insert a NULL value into the primary key of a table. Zero rows were inserted. I revised it to create a second version, which eventually got killed by the server (it timed out or over-burdened the database server, I guess) before it completed after over ten hours. Zero rows were inserted. The final version ran yesterday and overnight last night for over 16 hours, which makes it the longest-running data feed I have ever written by over 10 hours. This run was successful. Only 37,000 rows were inserted, but to get the data I had to comb over 45 million records, which is why it took so long.</p>
<p>As an auditor, I have not always believed it when IT would tell me a data feed took all weekend to run. This experience helped me understand than it can happen, especially when it is an ad-hoc job.</p>

			 <p>🎵 Today’s listen: <em><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/emotional-creature/1613600183">Emotional Creature</a></em> by Beach Bunny. I loved this emo-pop band’s debut LP, <em><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/honeymoon/1482041821">Honeymoon</a></em>, a couple years ago. I didn’t know this album was out, so I’m excited to listen to it. The lead single, <em><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/oxygen/1613600183?i=1613600190">Oxygen</a></em>, is good.</p>

			 <p>In my quest to fill my new Kobo with some good things to read, I quickly found <a href="https://gutenberg.org">Project Gutenberg</a>, which has tons of public domain books to download in various ebook formats. Unfortunately, most of its books are basically plaintext files. That is great for longevity and flexibility, but is not great for readability on an e-reader. Many (most?) of its books don’t look great on your Kindle or Kobo (or what have you).</p>
<p>Luckily, I found a website that fixes those formatting problems—at least for a subset of Project Gutenberg books: <a href="https://standardebooks.org">Standard Ebooks</a>. From its <a href="https://standardebooks.org/about">About</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Standard Ebooks is a volunteer-driven effort to produce a collection of high quality, carefully formatted, accessible, open source, and free public domain ebooks that meet or exceed the quality of commercially produced ebooks. The text and cover art in our ebooks is already believed to be in the U.S. public domain, and Standard Ebooks dedicates its own work to the public domain, thus releasing the entirety of each ebook file into the public domain. All the ebooks we produce are distributed free of cost and free of U.S. copyright restrictions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far, I like Standard Ebooks. Impressively, each of its books are available in four formats: ePub (in both “compatible” and “advanced” flavors for most e-readers), azw3 (for Kindle), and kepub (for Kobo). I wish there were more selection, but I guess that’s partly on me. I could clean up a public domain ebook and <a href="https://standardebooks.org/contribute">contribute it</a> to the site.</p>

			 <p>I bought the Kobo Clara HD thinking that I could side-load ePubs on it without converting them. While that <em>is</em> true, when you read a normal ePub—with at least some of them I have tried—you cannot change the font, margins, or line spacing. That is very frustrating.</p>
<p>I learned that Kobo has its own format, <a href="https://medium.com/@inesferreira789/kobo-kepub-format-why-and-how-9b5c1b39798">kepub</a>, which is basically ePub with some extra stuff added to it. Kepub files work exactly how you would expect e-books to work. This means that I am back to using <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com">Calibre</a> to converting my ePubs to a different format to read them on my e-reader.</p>
<p>This isn’t the end of the world. Calibre is an amazing piece of software, and it does just about everything you would ever need an e-book library manager and converter to do. Unfortunately, it is also the jankiest piece of software on my Mac. It is ugly (which doesn’t really bother me), it crashes regularly, and one time this week it froze so badly I had to do a hard-reboot to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Luckily, I don’t plan to use Calibre very often. That’s because I can also convert ePubs to kepubs with a command-line tool called <a href="https://pgaskin.net/kepubify/">Kepubify</a>. It works great! (There is <a href="https://pgaskin.net/kepubify/try/">a web-based version of Kepubify</a>, too, but I couldn’t get it to work.)</p>

<p>The site offers a wide range of free fonts, which you can test out in the browser and download for free, without jumping through any hoops. Other free font sites I have used in the past bordered on scammy, with all sorts of ads, trackers, and dark patterns that steer you toward non-free fonts. I almost always end up going to Google Fonts first when I am looking for a new font for coding or reading.</p>
<p>It also offers <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge">a pretty extensive knowledge base</a> that covers why typefaces are important and how to choose them effectively.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When installing fonts on my new Kobo e-reader, I came across a font that I had never heard of before: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=lexend">Lexend</a>. It is a free, sans-serif font with a bold mission and <a href="https://www.lexend.com">a rather audacious website</a>. Here is some of its most informative copy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1999, as an educational therapist, Dr. Bonnie Shaver-Troup, working with clients, began observing that reading issues masked the individual’s true capability and intelligence.</p>
<p>In 2000, Bonnie theorized that reading performance would improve through use of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sans-serif font to reduce cognitive noise</li>
<li>Expanded scaling to improve potential for character recognition</li>
<li>Hyper-expansion of character spacing, which creates a greater lag time and reduces potential crowding and masking effects</li>
<li>These changes led to the development of seven specially-designed fonts, which create an immediate improvement in reading performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where Lexend was formed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also a <a href="https://design.google/library/lexend-readability/">Google case study</a> that goes into some detail about the font’s unique features.</p>
<p>So far I installed its vanilla variant, simply called <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend?query=lexend">Lexend</a>, on my Kobo and read a few pages with it. It looks nice! I can install it on my iPad with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fontcase-manage-your-type/id1205074470">FontCase</a>, but I can’t use it in the app I read in most, which is Apple Books. That severely limits how useful it will be for me. At some point, I would like to test it out on difficult reading material and see if it helps me stay focused and improves my recall.</p>

			 <p>I got my Kobo this afternoon, set it up, and started noodling with it.</p>
<p>My library card needs to be renewed, so I was locked out of logging into Overdrive to worry library books. Side-loading books was very easy, and I don’t need to convert my ePubs beforehand either, which I had to on my Kindle<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I wish the Kobo had a USB-C port instead of micro-USB, but I won’t be plugging it in too often, so that’s not a big deal.</p>
<p>So far, I find the reading experience to be OK. The screen is sharp, but it is really small! I had read that it was the same size as the Kindle Paperwhite’s screen, but it is, in fact, noticeably smaller. I am not sure how much I like it. I feel like I can only fit a paragraph or two onto the screen at one time. I probably just have to get used to it, and think of it as a “paperback” compared to the “hardcover” size of my iPad.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Today I learned about <a href="https://chromeenterprise.google/os/chromeosflex/">ChromeOS Flex</a>, which is an easy way to install Chrome OS on any computer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try the cloud-first, fast, easy-to-manage, and secure operating system for PCs and Macs. ChromeOS Flex is a sustainable way to modernize devices you already own. It’s easy to deploy across your fleet or simply try it to see what a cloud-first OS has to offer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t really have a use for it, but I wish I did. I think ChromeOS, with its Linux support for things I care about, like Visual Studio Code and the terminal, would be a fantastic OS for web browsing and some types of software development. I have been thinking about taking an old or underpowered Windows computer and putting Linux on it, but Chrome OS may be more polished and better suited to my family’s needs.</p>
<p>Back when I was an IT auditor, I would recommend that IT organizations at big companies shift their lower-skilled workforce from Windows to ChromeOS. Doing so would reduce support costs for their computers considerably, and would not impact their ability to do their jobs. (All their systems had a web front-end.) That was a long time ago, and there were no takers, but I still think it is a good idea. I’m glad Google is pushing forward with it, and expanding the vision beyond ready-made ChromeBooks to an installable OS.</p>

			 <p>I just impulse-purchased a <a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-clara-hd">Kobo Clara HD</a>. I hope it wasn’t a bad decision.</p>
<p>I need an e-book reader only for a few weeks each year, during my summer vacation, which is coming up soon. I have an old Kindle, which I trot out annually to read outside with during my vacation, but its lack of a backlight and its low resolution make it hard to read in way too many places—not just indoors, but outside in the shade as well. It is disappointing in every way.</p>
<p>I probably should have purchased a Kindle Paperwhite during Prime Day instead, but I don’t want another Kindle. I want something that handles ePubs natively, can side-load fonts, and can interface with my local library. The Kobo fits all these criteria.</p>
<p>It will be delivered as soon as tomorrow. I’m excited to take it for a spin.</p>

			 <p>A little while ago, <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2022/05/20/sony-whm-headphones.html">I bemoaned that the Sony WH-1000M4 headphones were disappointing to me</a>. I’m happy to report they have been working pretty well as my gym headphones. The fit is pretty good (they don’t fall off unless I’m practically upside down) and the sound plus noise cancellation are more than adequate. The creakiness I observed when they were brand new seems to have gone away. My only complaint is that, when I bring my iPad with me to watch TV shows while doing cardio, it can be a pain to get the headphones to connect to it. They seem to want to connect only to my phone.</p>
<p>My gym almost never plays music, which is great because everybody wears some kind of wireless headphones there. I mostly see AirPods Pro around the gym, but a few people have the AirPods Max, and I wish I did, too. Their tighter fit and punchier sound, compared to the Sony WH-1000M4, would be welcome. A handful of other people at my gym use the same headphones I do, so I don’t feel crazy for not using purpose-built workout headphones there.</p>

			 <p>At work, I rely on compression to keep my hard drive from filling up with huge data files that I need to work with and keep for the duration of a project. Because I mainly care about saving storage space, when it comes to file compression, I care mostly about compression ratio and only secondarily about compression and decompression speed.</p>
<p>Over the years I have become somewhat of a file compression nerd. To that end, on a whim today, I uninstalled my longtime favorite archive manager, <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/index.html">7-zip</a>, from the Windows machine I use for work and installed <a href="https://peazip.github.io">PeaZip</a> in its place.</p>
<p>PeaZip is a front-end to a host of open-source file compression methods, including old stalwarts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)">Zip</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7z">7Z</a>, and also newer entrants such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZPAQ">ZPAQ</a>, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/">Zstandard</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/google/brotli">Brotli</a>. These newer methods offer higher compression ratios, greater speeds, and differing trade-offs between the two.</p>
<p>PeaZip’s main benefit over 7-zip is its far-nicer file manager interface than 7-zip. Its nicer UI has never been enough to entice me to switch from 7-zip, but I made the switch to try out Zstandard (primarily) and ZPAQ. With the data I have on hand, which is mainly data files in text format, I found that ZPAQ offered the best compression ratio (which is the most important thing to me), but that 7Z offered almost the same compression ratio while being the non-Zip format I am already used to using<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This surprised me, but it is good to know because my usage of PeaZip may be limited. While PeaZip has a nicer interface and more features, it is slower to launch (even to create an archive), and it lacks 7-zip’s integration with the Windows File Explorer right-click-and-drag handler. If I am going to use it primarily to make 7Z archives, and rarely use its file manager interface because I use its the Windows File Explorer right-click-and-drag handler, PeaZip does not offer me any features I really care about.</p>
<p>I am still curious about Zstandard, and will continue to explore how I can use it to compress my data files more quickly, but with better compression ratios, than 7-zip and Zip do.</p>

			 <p>A miser knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. I feel that way sometimes about the people tracking my time at work. The thing is, <em>they</em> don’t bother me about how long it takes me to do my work. <em>I</em> bother me about it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>A constant source of frustration for me is that everything I do takes longer than I expect it to. This is true whether I am doing something for the first time or the hundredth. I try to build it into my time estimates, but it is often impossible to guess how much time may be wasted on overcoming a technical setback. Most of my coworkers don’t have technical setbacks, per se. They are working primarily in Excel and Word rather than creating databases queries and analytical scripts. Consequently, they don’t understand how difficult it is for me to make time estimates. I can’t possibly create an accurate estimate of how much time I could lose to a bug I created, some analytical framework not working as promised, or the speed of a database or a network share being far slower than expected.</p>
<p>It also bothers me that it takes me the same amount of time to do a lot of my work as it did ten years ago. It isn’t because I haven’t gotten better at my work; the <em>quality</em> of my work is better, but adding that level of quality takes more time than doing the work in a slapdash, non-repeatable, non-controlled way. This kind of thing is true in my hobbies, as well. I can’t solve Sudoku puzzles or crosswords must faster than I could years ago. While solving quickly isn’t necessarily the point of doing puzzles, it makes me feel that I have plateaued in my abilities and possible cannot get any better.</p>
<p>I suppose, as I have gotten older, I have learned to be considerate and to care about quality over speed. Unfortunately, the world, I am afraid, still values the glib and quick over the thoughtful and slow.</p>

			 <p>Early in my career, I ended up working on Microsoft SQL Server projects as a software developer and a business analyst. Over several years, I became an expert<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> in data modeling, performance tuning, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">ETL</a>, numerous database connection options, numerous database programming libraries. Even after I left my software development job behind, I wrote queries and developed metadata layers for analytical reporting. Over that time, I wrote a <em>ton</em> of SQL queries, and I had a very opinionated way of structuring them, which was essentially clean <a href="https://blog.ansi.org/2018/10/sql-standard-iso-iec-9075-2016-ansi-x3-135/">ANSI SQL</a>.</p>
<p>When I moved to audit, I had no use for SQL for years. Consequently, I did not keep up with Microsoft SQL Server for years. When my job became more technically oriented again, I was surprised to learn that SQL—or at least Microsoft SQL Server’s support T-SQL language—had evolved. One of my favorite features, which premiered in SQL Server 2005, but I was late to learn about, is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/with-common-table-expression-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16">common table expressions</a>, or CTEs. Learning CTEs changed the way I write queries entirely.</p>
<p>Conceptually, a CTE is a temporary table based on a SQL query. Practically, CTEs let you break up a complex query into several simpler ones. I like to consider each CTE to be a step in a multi-step process that builds the dataset I need.</p>
<p>CTEs are very useful when you want to create a calculation and then group on the calculated value. Without CTEs, you have to copy/paste the entire calculation into the GROUP BY clause, which is error-prone and confusing to read. With CTEs, you can filter the data in one step, then make your calculations in another step, then group by the calculated values in the next step, then sort and select the top 10 calculated values in the final step.</p>
<p>From a performance standpoint, SQL Server optimizes the query you type in. Behind the scenes, it doesn’t actually create a temporary table for every CTE you create. That means that there is usually no, or negligible, impact to using CTEs in your queries.</p>
<p>Now, all but the simplest queries I wrote are a collection of common table expressions. Once you understand what they are, they make complex SQL queries a lot easier to reason through when writing them, and a lot easier to understand when reading them. In my field, audit, understanding the query and being able to reason about its correctness is often the most important consideration.</p>

			 <p>My Schiit Magni 3 amplifier is acting up again. Tonight it is ground loop hum. Before tonight, it has been annoyingly sensitive (that is, it <em>pops</em> loudly) to the tiny amount of static electricity generated by my feet scuffing the low-pile carpet when I rise from my chair. When I stand up while wearing my headphones, it pops very loudly, which is painful to my ears, and then it will hum angrily the rest of the day.</p>
<p>When the Magni 3 works it is sublime. Unfortunately, I can’t always use it due to electrical issues, and I wonder if the popping problem could blow out my headphones someday. Early in its life it got fried and I had to RMA it. I’m not sure it is worth spending $80 or more for a power conditioner to try to fix it. I think it may be more trouble than it is worth.</p>

			 <p>I have been experimenting with writing ETL (extract, transform, load) scripts in Python for work. The scripts were mostly fun and easy to write, but the outcomes have been disappointing: unacceptably slow load times.</p>
<p>I usually work with an instance of SQL Server that runs locally on my computer. I use it for data collection, analysis, and reporting, and have never needed a shared server. In the local environment, I have always loaded .csv files to staging tables via BCP or the BULK INSERT command in T-SQL scripts; then I use T-SQL queries or stored procedures to load the data into the destination tables. This approach is very fast, but it only does “L” part of ETL (load). It also doesn’t work for remote databases, unless I have access to a filesystem that database server can read.</p>
<p>A Python script using a library such as PETL or Pandas, on the other hand, can do the whole thing: read a file in from just about any file format, transform the rows and columns in various ways, then load it into the database.</p>
<p>Lately I have been working with various databases that are stored somewhere in the cloud. They are the slowest databases I have ever worked with, and I don’t have access to the filesystem they can BULK INSERT from. Writing an ETL script lets me work around that problem easily. By far the hardest part of writing my first ETL scripts with Python was getting working SQL connection string. (I think that part would have been a cinch if our database was something open source like PostGRES.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my simple ETL script could load a table at the rate of 5 records per second, which is comically slow. At that rate, our data will take days or weeks to load. I’m not sure what the bottleneck is. It is probably slow network transfer time on top of a hugely sub-optimal data insertion method on the database side. I think that, in the end, it may not be worth figuring out. I should probably try <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/integration-services/import-export-data/import-and-export-data-with-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard?view=sql-server-ver16">a better tool for the job</a>.</p>

			 <p>I started teaching my son Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html">turtle graphics</a> this week. He’s only 5, but he is absolutely mad for computers and is thrilled to get to use them to do something.</p>
<p>I first learned to program using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">turtle graphics</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a> when I was in third grade. It was back in the 1980s, when computers were too expensive for my family to own, so it was also the first time I ever used a computer. My mom signed me up for a class at the local community college. We all used Apple IIs in the computer lab, which were probably old even then. Most of those machines had green monochrome monitors, and all of them had two 5.25” floppy drives. Now, of course, he is using my old MacBook Pro on my couch, and coding with Python in Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>We have been working through some simple exercises, like finding different ways to draw a square. He understands looping already, and asked how to create an infinite loop to draw the square (and watch the turtle move) endlessly.</p>
<p>He and I are progressing very slowly, mostly because he asks lots and lots of questions, and partially because he is interested in doing things with turtle graphics that I was not prepared to teach him. (I had planned to teach him to draw lines and shapes. He is more interested in turning the turtle into a rocketship and moving it all around the screen.)</p>
<p>He is getting it. I installed <a href="https://omz-software.com/pythonista/">Pythonista</a> on his iPad last night, and this morning he used it to write a Python program all on his own, starting with:</p>
<pre><code>from turtle import *
</code></pre>
<p>It’s pretty cool.</p>

We are going through a “step up to fifth grade” packet that her math teacher gave us. I am making up my own problems based on the material and challenging her to think mathematically, too. She is an A+ student in the middle level of math in her grade, but she has been unable to pass the school’s rigorous, though largely arbitrary, criteria to gain entry into the highest level.

First, I showed him how to to use a <a href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter</a> notebook in Visual Studio Code. We made Markdown and Python cells. For the Python cells, I walked him through a Hello World example. I then had him print out whatever he wanted many times in a for loop.

In a short amount of time, he learned <code>print</code>, <code>for</code>, and <code>range</code>, which is pretty good for a five-year-old’s first lesson.

			 <p>I have been burning the midnight oil over the past week writing a data validator program—basically a front-end to the <a href="https://petl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">PETL</a> validate function—in Python. This would be my third such program, and it is going to be the sort where it can be configured entirely, and flexibly, with configuration files. Theoretically, it should not require coding, or at least not that much coding, to set up validation rules. It has been a fun project thus far, and it is nearing the point where all the pieces will come together.</p>
<p>Lately I have been writing unit tests, and that has been where all the pain points have been. I used to use Python’s standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">unittest</a> framework for unit testing, but it requires so much repetitive code that I decided to use <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/">pytest</a> instead. Pytest lets you parametrize unit test functions, which reduces code repetition considerably.</p>
<p>I never used pytest before, and ended up spending a lot of time trying to figure out how to get it working correctly. Getting my test module access to the package I’m testing was the first major hurdle. After that I spent a couple hours figuring out that I couldn’t make test fixtures that return lists, and that I couldn’t use text fixtures as test parameters. For the latter, I found a workaround in the form of the <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/">pytest-lazy-fixture</a> package.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My favorite tech discovery of the week was this one: an old TechNet post titled “<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/a349801f-398f-4139-8e8b-b0a92f599e2b/enable-recycle-bin-on-mapped-network-drives?forum=w8itpronetworking">Enable Recycle Bin on mapped network drives</a>.” This article helped me figure out how to get the Windows Recycle Bin working on my primary documents folder, which is a mapped drive that isn’t <em>really</em> a mapped drive.</p>
<p>For historical reasons, I store my documents on a mapped drive that is actually a deeply nested folder on my hard drive. Several years ago, my company implemented Microsoft OneDrive for file sync, sharing, backup, and so on. While that is great, it did mean that I had to move my folder tree to a very long path. Because I like to use long, descriptive names for everything, I ended up bumping into “file path too long” errors, especially in Excel. Excel will not even open a file whose path is over 256 characters long.</p>
<p>When your Microsoft OneDrive root folder already takes up almost 100 characters, that leaves too little left for me to use. To get around the character limit, I used the <code>[SUBST]</code> command in a startup script to substitute a drive letter (Z: in my case) for a folder on the C: drive.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The downside of using SUBST is that you get no support for the Recycle Bin<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. To get around that limitation, I found that using <a href="https://www.farmanager.com">FAR Manager</a>, rather than File Explorer, as my file manager would actually move files to the Recycle Bin upon deletion. Unfortunately, FAR Manager’s text-only interface and general jankiness led me to abandon it for <a href="https://doublecommander.com">Double Commander</a>, which is superior for my needs but does not move the file to the Recycle Bin on my mapped Z: drive.</p>
<p>The TechNet post I found describes a way to make a .reg file that will update the Windows Registry and create a new mapped drive to whatever location you want, with full Recycle Bin support. You create the file, run it once, and you are all set. The drive, unlike one mapped with <code>SUBST</code>, will persist across reboots, and it will have full Recycle Bin support.</p>
<p>I love it, and think I should try to write a PowerShell or Python script that will create such mappings without having to edit a .reg file manually.</p>

			 <p>Much to my surprise, I have been relying heavily on a very old Windows app, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/robocopy">Robocopy</a>, at work the past few days. Part of the work I need to do this week involves moving very large files to and from a network share over a very slow VPN connection. Those file transfers were hosing my file manager, <a href="https://doublecommander.com">DoubleCommander</a>, so I started doing them from Windows Terminal via Robocopy. It’s a tool I haven’t really used in about 20 years, when I wrote batch jobs to deploy my software or move data files around, but it still works.</p>
<p>It defaults to copying folders, but it is easy to configure the command to move individual files or groups of files. I love how it provides a summary of what it is going to do, and provides a completion percentage as it copies or moves each file.</p>
<p>Tonight, I learned of a feature that I should have been using the whole time: the <code>/compress</code> flag. It will request network compression during the file transfer, if it is available. I will try that tomorrow to see if it speeds up those enormous file transfers I have been doing.</p>

			 <p>I set up an old MacBook Pro for my son a little while ago, which I finally gave to him today. I set up an old—but, compared to the Mac, far newer and far more powerful—Windows machine today for my daughter. Setting up my son’s Mac was a breeze. Nearly everything was downloaded via the Mac App Store, and I needed one reboot for a system update.</p>
<p>Setting up the Windows 11 machine took a lot more work. To be fair, it was, in one way, easier: almost all the software could be installed and updated on the command line via <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli">winget</a>. Most of the updates were handled by one command: <code>winget upgrade --all -h</code>, which is close to the <code>apt update</code> and <code>apt upgrade -y</code> commands I use on my Ubuntu servers. Unfortunately, some packages would not update because reboots were needed, and Windows was very bad at explaining that to me.</p>
<p>Overall, it took about six reboots to get everything updated and to satisfy Windows Update. Sadly, the first time I booted into my daughter’s new account, which was just a few minutes ago, Windows Update requested a reboot immediately, so all the updates may not yet be done.</p>
<p>Overall, my experience Windows has gotten a lot better in the past few years, but it still lags behind the Mac and Linux in some important areas.</p>

			 <p>Listening to the AirPods Max for five minutes in an Apple Store ruined me for other noise-canceling headphones. Not because they sounded good. In fact, I listened to them only long enough to learn that they are bass heavy and exciting. What wowed me about them was the active noise cancellation. It was far better than anything I had ever experienced. It made the din of the Apple Store—all those human voices, which are difficult for ANC to cancel out—go away completely.</p>
<p>Sadly, they are $550 headphones (street price $479) that don’t even have an analog headphone jack, so they are both outside my price range and unsuitable–at least for me—for listening to lossless quality audio. Still, I wanted “industry leading” active noise cancellation, something better than I already have in my fancy <a href="https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/us/headphones/beoplay-h9">Beoplay H9</a>, for the times that I need it.</p>
<p>I read a lot of ANC headphone reviews and came to the conclusion that most reviewers recommend the Sony WH-1000M4 for its sound, excellent noise cancellation, and price. At $300 (street price $279) they are not cheap, but one could buy them <em>and</em> the AirPods Pro for cheaper than the AirPods Max (at its list price). Also, compared to the AirPods Max, the Sony WH-1000M4 is lighter, folds into a small, protective case, and has a headphone jack for wired listening.</p>
<p>I received them and immediately discovered that I don’t love them. They are <em>fine</em>, but that is disappointing to me. Perhaps they are overhyped by reviewers. Perhaps I am asking too much from them. For whatever reason, I, unlike most people, I guess, think they fall short of greatness.</p>
<p>This is my list of complaints that should serve as a counterpoint to all the glowing, uncritical reviews.</p>
<ol>
<li>They sound good, but not great. The nearest analog to them that I own is another Bluetooth ANC headphone, the Beoplay H9, which sounds punchier, tighter, brighter, and more exciting than the Sony WH-1000M4. I have three non-Bluetooth headphones that sound better than both the Beoplay and the Sony, too<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I have tried to EQ the Sony via its iOS app, but I have found no preset that I constantly prefer.</li>
<li>The active noise cancellation has an audible hiss and creates a bit of ear pressure. The hiss is disappointing. You don’t notice it during music, and probably won’t notice it in loud conditions where I would use these headphones, but it is annoying during podcasts or TV shows.</li>
<li>Active noise cancellation does not live up to the hype. I actually use ANC headphones a lot in my home office because they remove the drone from the window air conditioner I use when it gets hot. Sadly, I found that the Sony WH-1000M4, with its industry-leading ANC, blocks that noise no better than the Beoplay H9, which is an also-ran in the ANC space and has essentially no passive noise cancellation in its earcup design.</li>
<li>They aren’t that comfortable. My biggest problem with the BeoPlay H9 that I already had is its hard headband, which hurts my head after a while. The Sony headband does the same thing, despite the headphone being lighter and the headband being covered with softer material. The AirPods Max headband is very comfortable, but its clamping force borders on the extreme, so I probably would find it uncomfortable, too.</li>
<li>While their moving parts are silent, the faux leather ear cups creak and squeak when I move my head. It is infuriating. I have no other headphones that do this.</li>
</ol>
<p>I probably should have returned the Sony WH-1000M4 while I still had the chance. While I do expect to use them during walks on the treadmill and for plane travel in the future, I find that I almost always choose the Beoplay H9 over them for my everyday home-office-with-the-air-conditioner-on listening.</p>

			 <p>Today I learned a good way to generate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_data">dummy data</a> for use in the data analysis training I am going to perform next month.</p>
<p>While there are services like <a href="http://dumbdata.com">dumbdata.com</a> that can produce dummy datasets without requiring any programming at all, those tend not to work for me. My data needs are domain-specific. I don’t just need random names and addresses and things like that; I also need specific columns, including some inter-related financial data columns, for a dummy dataset to make sense to my audience.</p>
<p>I have been using Python a lot lately, so naturally I wrote a Python script to generate a table full of randomized, but real-looking, data. First I used <a href="https://petl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/%5C">petl</a>’s <a href="https://petl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/util.html?highlight=dummytable#petl.util.random.dummytable"><code>dummytable</code></a> command to create a base table full of randomized identifier numbers, dates, data categories, and dollar amounts. To generate real-looking data for that table, I used functionality from the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Faker/">Faker</a> package and from the standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html">random</a> library, including <code>Faker.date_between</code> and <code>random.choice</code>. Then I used petl’s <code>addfield</code> to add some fields with calculated and inter-related values. Next, I used the petl <code>cut</code> function to re-order a subset of the table columns and prepare them for export. Lastly, I used the petl <code>toxlsx</code> function to export the data to Excel.</p>
<p>It was surprisingly easy. Not having to write any of the functions to randomly generate the data or pick random selections from value lists made the process far quicker than it otherwise would have been. I wish I had known about these tools the last time I created a data analytics training demo.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Of course, on the weekend I have to write my annual self-evaluation essay for work, I read <a href="https://apple.news/A_yTqwloSTU6cMvZG4zvcFQ">this article in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> by Marcus Buckhingham. He spells out the problems with the annual review process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The failings of the annual performance review fall into three broad buckets:</p>
<p>They are too infrequent. They are dehumanizing. They are irrelevant to real-world performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For years I have complained to my “performance advisors” about the absurdity of the annual review process. Part of the problem is that goals—even <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/smart-goals">SMART goals</a>—are often unachievable because priorities, projects, and clients change over time. Another problem is that too much time is spent ranking employees, which leads to an outside focus on areas of improvement. Not enough time is spent highlighting areas of strength. Imagine how empowering a performance review would be if it was focused on what employees are good at and on finding ways to let them do those things even more.</p>
<p>I thought this detail, from deep in the article, was especially well-observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Workers want attention, not feedback, and mostly attention on where they’ve shown glimpses of something good, and how they might show more of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the past two years I have cultivated a much better attitude about performance reviews. I believe that the managers at the various companies I have worked at want to do the right thing with performance reviews, and are doing the best they can with the tools they have available. I think the problem is that the wrong tools are being used—and have been being used, for my whole career, at every place I worked. The reason for that is that how performance reviews are performed has been baked into general workplace culture. It’s pretty much the same everywhere; blame the MBAs and management experts who developed the general processes and the ideas behind them, I guess<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. No annual review process I have been a part of tries to break out of that mold and define a new culture.</p>
<p>In general, employers should help their employees develop their strengths and allow them to spend more time on them. It’s true that various weaknesses can and should be improved with training, coaching, and experience. In many cases, however, greater gains can be had in letting employees drop those areas of weakness and concentrate instead on further developing their areas of strength. That approach would develop the kind of employees that companies in my field want to hire: specialists with unique, world-class skills. In the market for workers, <em>that’s</em> what’s valuable. Why strive hard to become average in your areas of weakness when you could spend equal effort to become truly great at something?</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/28/23042819/bitcoin-2022-miami-beach-conference-maxis">Elizabeth Lopatto’s account of the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami Beach</a> is a rollicking and chilling account of a conference that is supposedly centered on the granddaddy of all cryptocurrencies, but is actually centered on the number one right-wing hobbyhorse: grievance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m at Miami Beach, in weather so hot and humid it feels like being inside a mouth, to try to get a sense of the vibes. I’m uncomfortable because of the heat and also the flashes of antisemitism. Tucked in the back of the expo floor, a painting for sale shows Tintin in a brown shirt with a Bitcoin logo on his sleeve, making a Sieg Heil salute. Another booth sells a T-shirt depicting a group of men sitting at a table with a pile of money in the middle, which is held up by human bodies; behind them, the pyramid found on the back of the dollar bill, with its Eye of Providence, looms. No one appears concerned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found it interesting to learn that there are Bitcoin diehards out there—the Bitcoin <em>maxis</em>—who absolutely hate crypto, NFTs, and any other blockchain technologies that are not Bitcoin. Stoking their fire—propping up Bitcoin at the expense of other, competing blockchain-based assets—seems to have been the main point of the conference.</p>
<p>I must admit feeling more than a little schadenfreude when reading about how half-assed the conference was, and how off-message some of its high-profile speakers were. We should expect nothing more from a grifters’ convention.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday, <em>The New York Times</em> published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/27/magazine/henry-winkler-barry.html">a very well-written profile of actor Henry Winkler</a> written by Matthew Klam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the producers of the HBO series “Barry” asked Henry Winkler to audition for the role of Gene Cousineau, they assured him that he was on a short list. Winkler said he was willing, as long as the list didn’t include Dustin Hoffman. “Because he’s a movie star. He’d get it. If Dustin was on the list, I wasn’t going in. They said no. I said OK.”</p>
<p>There was no particular reason to think the two-time Oscar winner would be up for the same part, but Winkler can be forgiven for indulging in a little paranoia. Across the span of his 50-year career, he has had some highs — 1970s pop-culture saturation to rival “Star Wars” and the music from “Jaws” — and lows, including a long stretch where he couldn’t get hired, filled with the sense that he’d been typecast into oblivion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Years ago I listened to a <a href="https://archive.org/details/The_Nerdist_Podcast_612">long interview of Henry Winkler on <em>The Nerdist</em> podcast</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that opened my eyes to how warm, generous, and philosophical Henry Winkler is. This profile provides some insight into those qualities, and also takes a deep dive—deeper than I would normally expect from a newspaper article—into Winkler’s audition for, and his acting in an early scene, in <a href="https://www.hbo.com/barry"><em>Barry</em></a>.</p>

			 <p>Leo Laporte, on <a href="https://overcast.fm/+ZarQS76gs">this week’s MacBreak Weekly</a> podcast, said that he is going to start calling Elon Musk an oligarch rather than a billionaire. I found that very interesting.</p>
<p>For some reason, we reserve the word “oligarch” for <a href="https://theconversation.com/meet-russias-oligarchs-a-group-of-men-who-wont-be-toppling-putin-anytime-soon-178474">very rich, powerful men <em>in Russia</em></a>, but I think it may be an apt term for any billionaire. Having that much money certainly grants a person outsized authority and autonomy. Each company Elon Musk owns controlling stake in must feel to him like a fiefdom in which he can do whatever he wants.</p>
<p>“Oligarch” has a pejorative connotation, which gives me pause when I think of applying it to a wide selection of people. However, I think the stink of it is deserved even for the billionaires that we like. People cannot accumulate wealth at such an unimaginable scale without having some form of moral stain on their characters.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Seeing <a href="https://macos8.app">Mac OS 8 emulated in a web browser</a> today brings back some pleasant memories of my years as a Mac tech in college. Most of the machines I worked on for that job ran OS 8 or OS 8.5, which to my Windows-centric mind were beautiful and fun to work on.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>For two years, I worked in the theatre building with one of my best friends. We were in charge of keeping the theatre professors’ computers—and almost all of the computers in student areas, working. That entailed defragging hard drives, installing productivity software, setting up backups, installing RAM, replacing laptop keyboards, performing OS upgrades, and so on.</p>
<p>When I first got the job, I had never even used a Mac before. The only Apple computers I had ever touched at that point were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIGS">Apple IIGS</a> in my middle school and high school, which I had used almost entirely for word processing. I would not have gotten the job if my friend had not vouched for me during the interview process. It turned out that my experience messing around with Windows software (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warez">warez</a> mostly, at the time) and reinstalling Windows every six months after inevitably bogged down, made me somewhat overqualified. If anything, fixing problems on a Mac was a lot easier than fixing similar problems on my PC.</p>
<p>My friend and I—and eventually a third person who I only met a few times—whipped the theatre building’s computers into shape within about a year. In my last year of college, the job became a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make-work_job">make-work job</a> for me. I set my own hours and did largely whatever I wanted to. People approved of my work, but a lot of it probably didn’t need to be done.</p>
<p>That year, I spent many hours working in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileMaker">FileMaker Pro</a> to build a sophisticated inventory system for the theatre’s hardware and software. I was a bit obsessive about it. Some nights I couldn’t sleep because I was thinking too much about solving programming- or database design problems. Well after midnight, I would get out of bed, walk across campus to the theater building, find my way inside<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and program in my little office for hours.</p>
<p>Meeting those theatre students—most of whom I would never have crossed paths with if not for this job—was one of the pleasures of working there. I remember that grad students were especially friendly and chill; they seemed like students from a completely different school than the competitive, stressful one I attended. The best part of the job, though, by far, was that I got comped two tickets to every show at the theater—whether they were student productions or professional ones. I went to every single show, which otherwise would have been far outside of my budget, and loved almost all of them. The experience kicked off a life-long love of theater…and of Macs, too, of course.</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>A few of the older Mac in the building ran the last version of System 7 and had monochrome monitors. Even then they seemed like relics. Still, I learned a lot about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">Hypercard</a> on them, so I have a soft spot for them, too.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <p>Douglas MacMillan, Faiz Siddiqu, Rachel Lerman, and Taylor Telford <a href="https://apple.news/AgFkLLKjTTGePUDaeL6VnOA">reported today in <em>The Washington Post</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elon Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion on Monday, the company announced, giving the world’s richest person command of a highly influential social media site that serves as a platform for political leaders, a sounding board for experts across industries and an information hub for millions of everyday users.</p>
<p>The acquisition followed weeks of evangelizing on the necessity of “free speech,” as the Tesla CEO seized on Twitter’s role as the “de facto town square” and took umbrage with content moderation efforts he views as an escalation toward censorship. He said he sees Twitter as essential to the functioning of democracy and said the economics are not a concern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have been only a handful of world’s richest people in my lifetime. Of those, Elon Musk is my least favorite. While he has done some good for the world, I find his public persona exhausting. He acts like a juvenile troll who plays to the cheap seats. His credibility in geek circles as a real-life Tony Stark is almost completely unearned. He just seems irresponsible, childish, and awkward to me—the ultimate dog that caught the car.</p>
<p>Last week, I thought that Musk’s hostile takeover offer was mere trolling, or maybe a means to drive a pump-and-dump scam on the sizable share of Twitter stock that he recently purchased. Now that he and his backers have bought the company proves me wrong, at least in the short term. Still, I have no faith in him making Twitter more successful than it is now. It is a company that I think found its level and is destined to stay there. I think that Twitter’s board decided the company’s value would never—at least, within a reasonable timeframe—appreciate to the 20% over its stock price that Musk offered. In that position, I would have taken the buy-out, too.</p>
<p>I can’t even remember when I last logged into my Twitter account now, so the change in ownership will not directly affect me, but it will likely indirectly affect all of us in some way. Musk’s championing of “free speech” and openness on the platform sound like right-wing dog whistles to me, which makes me nervous (more nervous) about the future. In general, the best thing we can do collectively is leave Twitter and publish and correspond elsewhere—preferably on platforms that are not owned by amoral billionaires.</p>

			 <p>To my amazement, my kids seem to like jazz. By “like”, I mean <em>don’t seem to mind</em>, which I will consider a win. They don’t mind when I play John Coltrane (who is one of my favorite jazz musicians) on the kitchen smart speaker. They don’t blink an eye when albums like <em>Jazz at the Pawnshop</em> or <em>Kind of Blue</em> are playing. Today, I put on a Louis Armstrong playlist during breakfast, told my kids about him while I was playing, and my daughter expressed actually excitement about it. She told us that had learned a little bit about Louis Armstrong in school.</p>
<p>Playing jazz at some of our family mealtimes started accidentally. One evening I was too tired to think of anything to listen to while cooking dinner, so I told our Amazon Echo speaker to play “cool music”. I thought it would return a playlist of <em>avant-garde</em> pop music or underground dance- or world-music artists I haven’t heard off. Instead, to my surprise, Alexa cooly replied, “Now playing cool jazz on Apple Music.” I thought that was hilarious. I grew up thinking that cool jazz music was terrible, hopelessly lame easy-listening crap, which is the furthest thing from “cool” you could imagine. It turned out that my wife and I kind of liked the cool jazz playlist; it made for pleasant background music. More importantly, the kids didn’t ask for it to be turned off immediately.</p>
<p>Since that accidental discovery, the breadth of jazz that I put on for them has increased dramatically. I think this is a great development because I grew up in a house without music, and had to learn about all the different genres on my own. I am still trying to work on introducing my kids to classical music, but that has been a much harder sell.</p>

			 <p>My five-year-old son is really into coding. He doesn’t know how to do anything yet, but he wants to learn. Currently he plays around with Swift Playgrounds a lot on his iPad (which is a little too old and slow to run it properly). He also orders his grandfather to program a collection of JavaScript games, utilities, and other doodads for him on a personal website. I’m going to start him on Scratch and Swift Playgrounds on the Mac. Because he is very interested in websites, I promised to introduce him to HTML and “Hello World!”-level JavaScript.</p>
<p>To get the ball rolling on this endeavor, I decided today that I will let him borrow (or use most of the time) my 15” 2013 retina MacBook Pro. It’s a little too big for him, screen-wise, but it’s the only machine I have. Tonight, I spent a half hour prepping it for him. Tomorrow, I plan to get NextDNS set up for web content filtering, and also to explore what other safeguards I can put on the machine to keep him out of trouble. He has a history, believe it or not, of setting up accounts on internet services and contacting the companies via web forms or email. I locked down his iPad, but he started to find ways around it today. I know I will have to keep a close watch of him.</p>
<p>I know he’s going to love using a real computer, not only for programming, but for Pages, Garage Band, and Photos as well. I hope that things go well.</p>

			 <p>Last year I told myself that if I have the opportunity to present to somebody, I will always create some visual aids to complement what I say. It’s an easy way to differentiate myself from my peers, who rarely make slide decks unless they are training clients. It also shows that I’m well-organized and a structured thinker.</p>
<p>I found out today that I can build a good-enough slide deck in about ten minutes and present it right afterward. Half an hour before a team teleconference today, I was asked to present on a technology topic to my team. I said yes, then dropped everything for about ten minutes to create a brief slideshow on a technical topic of my choosing. I decided to share with my group how I started using Python to automate data validation. Because I am the only Python user in the group—which is not a technical group—the idea was entirely new to them. This allowed me to keep my presentation brief and high-level, while still being informative.</p>
<p>I normally spend many hours working a slide deck. Much of that time spent brainstorming visual designs, arranging objects to build diagrams, and revising slides to make them more concise and more visually appealing. Today, I had no time for any of that. Instead, I turned to PowerPoint’s Design Ideas feature, which automatically formatted my text and the one image I imported (the Python logo) into six presentable slides. I selected a theme with a dark background and light text—which is the opposite of our company’s slide template—to make everything pop. Then I finished up by changing a couple of the PowerPoint SmartArt shapes from what Design Ideas had applied. The result was inferior to the slide decks I painstakingly assemble, but it was far better than nothing, and <em>nothing</em> was my competition, after all.</p>
<p>I hope that showing good presentation skills time after time will help me move up into a more senior position eventually. It’s just one thing I’m working on to get there.</p>

			 <p>I have spent practically all day coding, coding, coding. I am adding features to, and (more than anything) refactoring, the Python data validation program that I have been working on for my day job. The result isn’t perfect, but it is far better than where it was this morning.</p>
<p>First, I broke up my 600-line script into numerous module files. I was happy to learn how easy this is, but I am still a novice at what I can do with the Python <em>package</em> I have created. Having multiple files allowed me to refactor the major features of the application, and to identify the customization points I need to work on next, without getting lost in a single, enormous source code file.</p>
<p>Then, I started to delete stale code, refactor old but working code, and optimize the performance of the major data pipelines. It felt good to make everything streamlined.</p>
<p>Lastly, I did some testing. I don’t have proper unit tests, and still need to learn how to structure a Python package properly to allow for unit testing. That may be tomorrow’s task.</p>

			 <p>When I was a kid, I watched <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>. One thing that I remember is that Captain Picard—in some future timeline, at least—retires to his family’s vineyard in France. It was a place that looked pleasant but terribly boring. It was far afield from the exotic, exciting locales that his starship captain career brought him to.</p>
<p>I always wondered why someone with such an exciting life would end up someplace so boring. Now that I’m older, I get it. I fantasize about spending my old age (which is still a long way off) with my wife in a pleasant, quiet, and otherwise unremarkable New England town—the kind of place that was abhorrently dull to me when I was younger.</p>

			 <p>When I was in college at Brandeis University, a friend of a friend<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> was in a band. A <em>cool</em> band. He played cello in <a href="https://betwixt1.bandcamp.com">Betwixt</a>, which was, at the time, a critically-acclaimed Boston-based noise/art-rock band. They played a few shows on campus, and I’m pretty sure I saw them play in Boston at least once, too. It was always a blast to see them perform. Their onstage vibe was cool and sexy. The singer was always dancing and working the crowd, while the lead guitarist stood in the back doing everything he could to avoid playing a normal guitar line. His guitar, amp, and effects pedals were coerced into making the most unusual sounds, all rhythmically slotted into into cheerful, poppy tunes. All together, they blew my mind.</p>
<p>I found their music on Apple Music today and listened to their two albums, <em><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/moustache/1541027854">Moustache</a></em> and <em><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-salty-tang/1532910487">The Salty Tang</a></em>. It was a fun nostalgia trip.</p>

			 <p>I am giving Microsoft OneNote a try again at work.</p>
<p>This is surprising to me. I’m a plaintext lover who has taken notes in Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code for <em>years</em>. It seems crazy to move from simple-to-understand text files to a clunky, proprietary format stored in a monolithic database in a weird location on my system.</p>
<p>Furthermore, OneNote is the one corner of Microsoft Office that I have never liked. Its notebook metaphor, with its tabs and its pages, feels outdated. The way that the notes consist of floating text boxes that are bounded by visible rectangles, is visually clunky when compared to Apple Notes. Its rich-text editor is powerful but feels slow; using it feels like writing in Microsoft Word, which I never want to do<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It doesn’t even support Markdown, which is my preferred way of writing just about everything. I don’t use a Windows tablet or sync my work stuff to an iPad; if I did, I probably would have switched to OneNote already, just for its stylus support and drawing features.</p>
<p>Despite all my misgivings about it, I’m giving OneNote a real try right now for several reasons. First, I need to switch things up. Using Visual Studio Code for writing, task management, executing scripts, and coding is just too much. I have so many Visual Studio Code windows open that its hard to get to the right one. Also, Visual Studio Code is versatile, but it is not quick.</p>
<p>Second, my company constantly promotes OneNote constantly on both the intranet home page and on our company-mandated screensavers. Visually, I can’t escape its name or icon. I figured that I may as well try it. For all I know a ton of people who don’t have the same hang-ups about its design are using it and getting a lot out of it.</p>
<p>Third, I tend to stick as much to Microsoft software as possible on my Windows machines: I practically live in Excel, I edit in Word, I communicate in Outlook, browse the web in Edge, and write and code in Visual Studio Code<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. I’m the kind of nut who wishes my company would switch from Webex to Microsoft Teams—despite people hating Microsoft Teams—because I want to be using more Microsoft software.</p>
<p>Lastly, and maybe most importantly in the long run, OneNote offers tight integration with Outlook. When looking at a calendar entry, I can click one toolbar button to immediately start taking notes in OneNote. Similarly, when reading an email, I can click one toolbar button to immediately import it into OneNote. Who knows, maybe even OneNote web clipper will be useful.</p>
<p>So I am going to give OneNote an honest try for the next week and see if I can stick with it. From a user-interface standpoint, I may be able to live with it. I switched the font from Calibri to Consolas, so it looks a bit more like my Visual Studio Code setup. I am learning to ignore the ever-expanding gray box that surrounds the text I write. More importantly, I found an option to put the page list on the left instead of the right, which brings it a step closer to the Mac and iOS three-pane interfaces that I vastly prefer to Microsoft’s brutalist designs.</p>
<p>The real test is not whether I learn to like it, but whether I start using it to take more notes and track more tasks.</p>

			 <p>The best podcast episode I listened to today was <a href="https://overcast.fm/+oiPWbDrrA">the April 5th episode of The Ezra Klein Show</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dan Olson is the creator of a two-hour-YouTube video, “Line Goes Up,” that has now been viewed nearly seven million times. “Line Goes Up” is the single most comprehensive critique of crypto that I’ve ever heard. And that’s because Olson isn’t just focused on cryptocurrencies as a technology or an asset class, but on the crypto universe as a distinct culture underpinned by a powerful ideology. It’s easy to think about the lingo, the acronyms and the myths associated with the crypto world as incidental to the value of cryptocurrencies and NFTs as assets. But for Olson, the culture and the currency are inextricably linked. And once you’ve made that connection, suddenly a lot of the problems, warning signs and potential dangers of crypto become visible in a new way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The longer I look at crypto the more of a scam it seems to be. Dan Olson brings almost every argument I have read—or made myself—against crypto to the table, and pushes some of them further than I have thought.</p>
<p>One of Olson’s most interesting insights is that the pseudo-anonymity that crypto wallets will, counter-intuitively, reduce your financial price. This is because crypto wallets are pseudonymous<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> rather than anonymous, and a blockchain, which stores transaction history for crypto wallets, is open. Therefore, if you know someone’s crypto wallet ID—because you paid them back for something with crypto—you could use that ID to look up all their prior transactions on the blockchain. You could get a good idea how much money they have or spend, and get a good idea about where they spend it, too.</p>
<p>I am concerned that governments eventually will instate their own cryptocurrencies, perhaps for nefarious purposes but more likely for stupid ones, and we will all be stuck using them (ahem, ride that rocket-ship to the moon<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>) despite all their downsides.</p>

			 <p>I watched about an hour of Apple TV+’s <em>Friday Night Baseball</em> last night.</p>
<p>The picture quality was fantastic, both in terms of sharpness and color. I think that the MLB service also has great picture quality, too, but Apple’s streams looked better to me than Thursday’s streams from MLB.tv. I liked the near lack of graphics and other nonsense on the screen.</p>
<p>The announcers were sporadically good, but sometimes they were so far off topic that they didn’t bother to call the game. At times they were so caught up in their own conversation that it reminded me of watching meaningless late-season games between teams with no chance of making the playoffs. I bet the announcers got a bunch of notes about this already and will try to stay more focused on the games going forward.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I spent a good chunk of time today creating a data validation program using Python. Python is a language I know (to some extent) but I barely use. Instead, I write scripts in PowerShell, create more complex programs in C#, and analyze data with SQL queries, Galvanize Analytics, or Power Query in Excel. My goal today was to find a way to validate a large number of .csv files, which have a great many columns and will be of questionable quality. My normal tools and languages would be either too cumbersome or too limited to do this, so I reached for Python.</p>
<p>Python is great at importing .csv files, parsing them, modifying them, and outputting a modified copy. Within a few minutes of research, I discovered a Python package called <a href="https://pypi.org/project/petl/">petl</a>, which contains a ready-made data validation pipeline. I just needed to create validation functions, which are simple 1-3 line functions, and use them to define constraints, which are simply dictionaries. All those constraints get put into an array and passed to an already-written validation method.</p>
<p>Coding this program has been fun and remarkably efficient. It has been fun coding in Python again. I particularly love how packages can make the hard parts easy and leave me with more time to spend on my data work rather than on creating scaffolding for the program. I will have to look into more uses for Python going forward.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>At the start of my career I learned an important lesson: The reward for doing good work is always more work. That often works in your favor. As you advance in your career, you move from doing many simple, repetitive tasks to solving fewer, more complex, and more interesting problems. In general, my experience bears this out—but not always.</p>
<p>In my first real job, I was a software developer in a small group within a large company. I started out knowing very little about how to do my job other than the programming fundamentals I picked up in A.P. Computer Science. However, I was smart and driven; I worked very hard and eventually became the best and most knowledgable programmer in my group—at least when it came to web and database development. For my effort, I was award with promotions and raises <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but the nature of my work actually got worse instead of better.</p>
<p>Because I was so good at figuring out how other people’s code worked, troubleshooting, and fixing the hardest-to-fix bugs, those became my primary responsibilities as a programmer. I was no longer writing small systems from scratch or developing clean architectures. Instead, I had two roles. First, I was the Sherlock Holmes of diagnosing and fixing coding problems for other members of my team. Second, I was in charge of the technical side of large software integration projects. These are projects that involve bringing in code from people outside the company and making it work on our company’s systems. In both of these roles, I spent many hours a day wrangling with other people’s messy, awful codebases. In the end, my projects were successful, which was rewarding, but a lot of the day-to-day work was mind-meltingly difficult and unsatisfying.</p>
<p>I had moved from performing lots of simple tasks well to solving more complex—but <em>not</em> more interesting—problems. Sometimes I think that work, programming, and life works out that way.</p>

			 <p>Over the past week, I played through <em>Children of Morta</em> on my Nintendo Switch. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">Roguelike</a> game built around combat and dungeon crawling, with several gimmicks to keep it interesting. There is a strong story element and a very enthusiastic narrator; unfortunately, I didn’t think the story amounted to much in the end.</p>
<p>Overall, I enjoyed it. It reminded me a little bit of the <em>Diablo</em> games, though my memory of those games is quite hazy.</p>
<p>At first I found it nearly impossible to beat the first dungeon’s boss. I could reach the boss from my very first run, but I could not defeat it. I discovered that you have to grind and level up your characters’ stats. Once I did that many, many times, my characters were strong enough to kill that boss, and basically everything else that came afterward.</p>
<p>I very much appreciated that you did not have to mash the attack button endlessly during combat. Instead you rock the right analog stick in the direction you want to loose your arrows or swing your sword. It works very well, much like a twin-stick shooter.</p>
<p>While the game is fun, it gave me some frustrating moments, too. I experienced a game-breaking bug several times near the end of the game. Sound effects would loop and then cut out entirely; eventually the game would crash. I lost one of my runs entirely due to this bug. It hit me again during my fight with the final boss, which really put me on edge; fortunately, the game did not crash and I was able to complete it anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Barry, which returns to HBO for its third season April 24, Hader plays a reluctant hitman who wants to be an actor. Barry is just really great at killing. This is not so different, Berg points out, from Hader, who became a star on SNL in his 20s almost in spite of himself, fought crippling anxiety on the live broadcasts, and really just wanted to write and direct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am very excited that <em>Barry</em> is returning to HBO soon. It is a daring show on many levels. Plot-wise it flirts with show-ending (or at least show-ruining) disaster several times each season. I have no idea how the cliffhanger at the end of Season 2 will be resolved, but I am confident that the writers came up with something satisfying.</p>
<p>I love Bill Hader, too. He is amazing and deserves every bit of success he has had.</p>

			 <p>I have watched enough episodes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAzrgbu8gEMIIK3r4Se1dOZWSZzUSadfZ">Hot Ones on YouTube</a> to pique my interest in hot sauces. So far I have a bottle of a chipotle-inspired sauce and a bottle of sriracha. I am trying to enjoy them. So far they taste more acidic than hot to me. Perhaps I need to learn to cook with hot peppers instead of dabbing sauce on things.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My five-year-old son just realized that he, and everyone he knows, will die someday. It has lead to unexpected, devastating dinner conversations the past two evenings.</p>
<p>I don’t know why he started thinking about it. Out of nowhere, he started asking questions about death at dinner last night. At the time, my daughter and I had just started talking about Beethoven. I had looked up the composer’s Wikipedia entry and was reciting when he was born and when he died. Suddenly, my son—who knows that batteries die, that plants die, and even that animals die—asked in a shocked voice, “Why did he die?” Within a second, his lips started to quiver and he started to cry. A dozen other questions followed, none of them we were prepared to answer at a family dinner on a school night.</p>
<p>My daughter went through this same emotional journey four or five years ago. For her, it was precipitated by the death of my father, who was the first close family member to die since was born. She couldn’t understand why her Grampa was gone, and quickly became terrified that she would die, too. These thoughts scared her so much that she was afraid to fall asleep; my wife or I had to stay with her night after night in her bed to comfort her. We had a lot of talks about death with her to help her understand what it means and to begrudgingly accept it. Of course we told her the pleasant half-truths that death only happens to very old people and is nothing she needs to worry about for a long, long time.</p>
<p>My son has surprisingly practical concerns about death. Last night, he didn’t ask usb “Will I die?” He figured that out on his own and asked instead, “When will I die?” Tonight he asked us, with eyes wide with alarm, “Where will I go when I die?” My wife and I tried to explain to him that no one really knows, or that he would return to wherever he was before he was born. Those answers only made him more scared. Upon hearing them, he suddenly realized that he might not die in the same place as us or his sister, and became loudly distraught that he might end up somewhere where he couldn’t get to us anymore.</p>
<p>He then asked when my wife and I, are going to die. That did not bother me. When he asked when his sister was going to die, I teared up because it seemed unimaginable. Finally, before we could steer him to another, far lighter, topic of discussion, he became concerned, to the point of tears, that he is too big or too small to “fit” there—whatever that means. It astounds me that the physical dimensions of the afterlife—or whatever he imagines it to be—are what my little boy is worried about tonight.</p>
<p>All of my son’s thoughts and ideas about death have come, as far as we know, from his own imagination. No one close to him has died recently. We don’t talk about death much at all in our family; it is kind of taboo in our day-to-day conversations. Reflecting back on the past few weeks, however, I realize that he may have overheard the adults in the family discussing the untimely death of our rabbi’s husband, which occurred a week or so ago and understandably made us all very sad. We tried not to discuss it in front of our children—who did not really know the man—so that we would not upset them. Perhaps my son overheard us anyway.</p>
<p>It took my daughter a long time to come to terms with the idea that she is going to die someday. I am expecting my son to follow in her footsteps. He will probably have occasional nightmares about death—or at least have trouble falling asleep with worry about it. While it makes me sad to see my son start to go through this phase—and it has certainly led to some difficult dinner conversations—I know that he, like my daughter, is an emotionally healthy kid and will be fine. I expect him to think about death some more, talk about it with us, and become more emotionally mature through the process. He’s going to get through this; we all do.</p>
<p>It is quite a burden to understand that you, someday, are going to die. I wish I could ease that burden for my children, but I am wise enough to know that I cannot.</p>

			 <p>The best podcast episode I listened to today was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pTssBcIsz8">400th episode of <em>Upgrade</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s episode 400! We evaluate the forward-looking predictions we made back in episode 300, and then draft stories we&rsquo;ll be talking about over the next hundred episodes! Also, an Apple TV+ movie won Best Picture and we round up an awful lot of Apple rumors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Upgrade</em> is one of my favorite tech podcasts. Hosts Make Hurley and Jason Snell have a great rapport, and mostly talk about Apple and streaming TV services, which are beats that I enjoy learning and speculating about. Like most podcasts that track Apple, they they make predictions about product announcements before they happen. Unlike most other podcasts, they make the predictions fun by presenting them in the form of fantasy-sports-style drafts. It is a great tech podcast. I cannot believe I have listened to 400 of them already!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One of my favorite artists from the last few years, Frank Turner, has a new album out: <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/fthc/1584786710"><em>FTHC</em></a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It—at least parts of it—represents a swing back from his acoustic guitar-led singer-songwriter fare to his roots as a hardcore artist. Yes, that means it’s peppered with screaming and righteous anger. That usually isn’t my cup of tea, but I’m down with it. Frank Turner is cool and makes good records; you should listen to them.</p>
<p>What I love about Frank Turner is that he comes across as incredibly, even uncomfortably, open and honest. His songs mix together toughness with sensitivity, and cynicism with optimism, in a way that reveals both his maturity as a person and his cleverness when it comes to song structure. His lyrics range from poetic and clever to raw and emotional. His music ranges from quiet and beautiful to thunderous and anthemic—often in the same song. Overall, his albums give you the impression that he held nothing back in creating them. I very much respect and admire that.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Unlike any other musician I can think of, Turner even did <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/i-wont-sit-down-songwriting-with-frank-turner-part-1/">a very generous two-part interview with a <em>tech</em> podcast, <em>Dialog</em>, a few years ago</a>. He talked about his songwriting process and what it was like to be a working musician who is a little older and wiser than the clichéd young rock star you might imagine.</p>

<p>Another artist I like that does the same thing is The Avett Brothers.

			 <p>The best podcast episode I listened to today was <a href="https://overcast.fm/+LsGPupHY4">the unexpected return of an old favorite: <em>Tim Goodman’s TV Talk Machine</em></a>. The show ended in 2020. I never unsubscribed, and was surprised this week to find new episodes waiting for me. I would not have noticed them if there hadn’t been a redesign of Overcast, my podcast player, for me to look at this week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s been 612 pandemic-fueled days. But we’ve taken the tarp off the TV Talk Machine, replaced a few parts, and are ready to kick it into gear.</p>
<p>Tim spent the last two years writing TV scripts! He’s going to keep doing that, and write a book, and also has launched a newsletter on Substack so he can write about television again. And… did we mention the TV Talk Machine is back, too? It’s true!</p>
<p>In this episode Tim explains where he’s been, where he’s going, and the origin of his new project, which launches today! Also Jason raves about “Station Eleven” and believe it or not, there’s a letter from a listener!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tim Goodman was a TV critic who had clearly burned out by early 2020. He and co-host Jason Snell ended the podcast shortly after Goodman quit his TV critic job and started a secret (at the time) TV development deal. What I learned from this podcast back then is that it must be exhausting to be a TV critic, because it is impossible to keep up with all the TV shows and TV episodes coming out all the time, and because you have to watch shows you don’t even like sometimes in order to write about them or to be culturally current. In general, I figured that he had watched too much TV and got sick of it. This episode confirmed that I was right.</p>
<p>In the past I learned about a bunch of great TV shows from this podcast. That isn’t why it was fun to listen to, though. The subject matter is usually very light, and Goodman and Snell chat like old friends.</p>

			 <p>The best podcast episode I listened to today is <a href="https://overcast.fm/+QLdvmtf2U">this interview of Matt Mullenweg</a> on Decoder with Nilay Patel:</p>

<p>Matt Mullenweg is the CEO of Automattic, the company that owns WordPress.com, which he co-founded, and Tumblr, the irrepressible social network it acquired from the wreckage of AOL, Yahoo, and Verizon. Matt’s point of view is that the world is better off when the web is open and fun, and Automattic builds and acquires products that help that goal along.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mullenweg has a unique point of view for a tech founder and CEO. Patel is a smart and incisive interviewer who really seems to understand both tech and business.</p>
<p>I learned two interesting things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mullenweg thinks that WordPress could power 85% of the web within the next ten years.</li>
<li>Taylor Swift has a Tumblr.</li>

Because of all this, when I don’t feel especially productive, I stress myself out about it more than I think I should. I even stress out when I feel like I have had a productive day but think that it took me too long to do that work. Instead of feeling good, I end up feeling bad. Instead of feeling like I moved ahead, I feel like I fell further behind. This happens to me all the time.

<blockquote>
<p>After losing an hour of sleep over the weekend, members of the United States Senate returned to the Capitol this week a bit groggy and in a mood to put an end to all this frustrating clock-changing.</p>
<p>So on Tuesday, with almost no warning and no debate, the Senate unanimously passed legislation to do away with the biannual springing forward and falling back that most Americans have come to despise, in favor of making daylight saving time permanent. The bill’s fate in the House was not immediately clear, but if the legislation were to pass there and be signed by President Biden, it would take effect in November 2023.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am trying not to get my hopes up, but I would love it if we stopped changing the clocks twice each year.</p>
<p>I never really cared about it until I had kids. I learned the hard way that messing with their sleep schedule makes kids crazy, and the effect can last for weeks. Now changing the clicks is a twice-yearly curse.</p>
<p>I would prefer Daylight Saving Time year-round. Having sunlight in the early evening is of far greater value to me than having the sun rise earlier.</p>

Instead of following the Sox, I may watch the MLB free game of the day and jump around the league this year. It will be interesting to see how the new universal designated hitter rule plays out.</p>

			 <p>I want to help my daughter do a science fair project and create a fancy 3-fold poster for her elementary school’s science fair next month. I like the idea of making <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Oobleck/">oobleck</a> (a.k.a. “<a href="https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project-ideas/Chem_p110/chemistry/design-your-own-slime">slime</a>”) with cornstarch and water and doing some simple experiments with it. I think it would be a lot of fun. I wonder if it is too basic for fourth grade, but I expect it would be OK. I think that learning the format of creating an experiment and presenting it in poster form is a lot more important than the impressiveness of the experiment.</p>

			 <p>Kevin Draper reports for <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/13/sports/football/tom-brady-returning-buccaneers.html">The New York Times</a></em> that Tom Brady is rescinding his retirement announcement from only eight weeks ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brady, the 44-year-old quarterback who has won the Super Bowl seven times, wrote on his social media accounts Sunday evening that he would return to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to play his 23rd N.F.L. season.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can only admire Tom Brady’s gumption here. His numbers last season were so good that his retirement seemed unnecessary, despite his age. I wonder if he can win another Super Bowl ring. It he does, I wonder if he would <em>really</em> retire right afterward, or if he would keep pushing forward until he can’t compete at all anymore.</p>

She proudly showed my wife and me the books and the fancy pencils and erasers she bought there today. It is wonderful how much she loves to read and to write.</p>
<p>I always loved book fairs in elementary school, too. It was fun, as a kid, to get a chance to shop with real money and actually make buying decisions. I’m happy my daughter gets the same opportunity.</p>

It seems like a good way for kids to learn programming. I set him up with it on Saturday and tried to help him get started yesterday. So far his favorite part is the image editor, which of course is the non-programming part. He has been drawing and coloring with it most of the time. Tonight he showed me one of the animations he made with ScratchJr. Now I know he is interested in the programming part, too. Tonight he demanded I get him ScatchJr’s big brother: <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, which is just a web app. I look forward to seeing what he thinks of it.</p>

We play “1 Day” games, which are essentially correspondence chess. It is great fun playing against Andrew, but I don’t get to play with him in real time because we live on different sides of the planet. To see if I can beat an opponent—who is not one of my kids—in real time, I have played a number of blitz games, which are 10-minute games. Unfortunately, I always lose them badly or lose on time. The clock stresses me out, which makes the games not much fun at all.</p>
<p>It did not occur to me before today that I could start such a “1 Day” game against a random opponent on Chess.com just as easily as I could start a blitz game. I did so tonight, and now I have another long, slow game going. I am happy to have found another way to play chess against people at my level that won’t stress me out.</p>

			 <p>Jason Snell, on <em>Six Colors</em>, shared some interesting <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2022/03/apples-big-baseball-deal-detailed/">information about Apple’s Major League Baseball announcement on Tuesday </a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though NBCUniversal’s Peacock is rumored to be picking up ESPN’s old package for Monday and Wednesday night games, what Apple is doing is an entirely new license from Major League Baseball, containing three separate products…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to provide details about <em>MLB Big Inning</em>, linear and on-demand archival content, and <em>Friday Night Baseball</em>, which run the gamut from normal televised baseball to something akin to the NFL Red Zone.</p>
<p>As a lapsed baseball fan who happens to be an Apple One subscriber—mostly for the iCloud storage—I am excited about this. I bailed on my annual MLB At Bat subscription in 2020, due in large part to not having enough time to watch baseball games. I have been considering subscribing again this year, once the baseball season starts, but I am still not sure it is worth the money if I’m not going to watch a ton of games. Apple’s offerings, which I already pay for, may be just the right amount of baseball for me.</p>

			 <p><em>New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</em> is one of the disappointments in my Nintendo Switch collection. I had hoped it would bring me the same joy that <em>Super Mario World</em> and <em>New Super Mario Bros.</em> did in the past. Instead, I found it punishingly difficult, due to devilishly positioned enemies and a physics engine tailored to make the characters slip off platforms all the time. (Don’t even get me started about the Ghost Houses.) It seems to have been made for players who are so good at Mario games that they are absolutely sick of them and are interested only in an insane challenge.</p>
<p>The developers must have known it was too difficult, because they added two “easy-mode” characters <em>and</em> an option to have Luigi show a sample run of any level and allow you to skip it at the end. Despite these aides, on my first play-though, I stalled out in the middle—I literally could not get through the next level, whichever path I took—and gave it up for a couple years.</p>
<p>Last week, I was thinking about how poorly I fared at <em>New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</em>. I wondered it the reason I found it so difficult was that my Mario skills had atrophied. To test that, I played through <em>Super Mario World</em>, which I have not played in about 15 years. I was able to blow right through it (the Star World levels notwithstanding), so I don’t think my Mario skills are entirely the problem. I expected <em>Super Mario World</em>-level difficulty, but <em>New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</em> is a much harder game.</p>
<p>A few days ago I decided I was up for the challenge again, and would play and finish <em>New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</em> this time, hell or high water. I would not try to collect the three star coins in each level. I would not try hard to find the game’s plentiful secrets. I would even play as the second-easiest character, Toadette, the whole time <em>and</em> use Luigi’s sample runs to skip levels. I am not trying to collect star coins or trying hard to find secrets; I am simply trying to reach the end of each level.</p>
<p>Even with this plan, I have not yet finished it. I am <em>almost</em> at Peach’s castle, which is the last set of levels. I am glad that I finally discovered many of the colorful, creative, and clever bits that the game designers put into the game; in total, however, they fail to delight me. I’m sure that <em>New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</em> <em>is</em> a good game, but it is not a good game for me. I am not sure I will ever play the game again after I beat it.</p>

			 <p>Since watching the Apple announcement today and learning about the Mac Studio, I have never been happier that I did not wait for a more powerful Mac mini before I bought mine. The Mac Studio is more computer than I need and is out of my price range (for a desktop at least). I am thrilled that it exists for other people to use, and will happily listen to the pundits talk about for the rest of the month. For myself, though, the M1 Mac mini is more than enough, and the one I bought cost about $800 less than the least expensive Mac Studio.</p>
<p>The M1-based iPad Air is more relevant to me. I would love to hand off my current generation 4 iPad Air to my daughter and buy the new one for myself. I don’t need the performance for much, but for photo editing it will be a leap forward. I don’t think my daughter would ever go for this plan, though; my iPad Air is blue, not pink. I should have bought a neutral color.</p>

Ever since I got the generation 4 iPad Air I have wanted a MacBook that looks a little like two of them sandwiched together. For a little while longer I can dream that one will be unveiled tomorrow or later this year.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I gave a coworker some advice for giving effective presentations today. I told her some things worth remembering:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are the star of your presentation, not your slide deck.</li>
<li>Structure the presentation around ideas rather than facts.</li>
<li>Make the presentation structure seem simple and obvious to the audience. One thing should always lead to the next.</li>
<li>It is better to present fewer concepts well than it is to present more concepts poorly.</li>
<li>Incorporate narrative into your presentations if you can. People love stories and are more likely to remember concepts that are tied to stories and anecdotes better than those that are not.</li>
<li>At the beginning of your talk, convince the audience members why they should care about what you are telling them. If they care, they are more likely to listen to what you have to say.</li>
<li>A slide deck should not be a reference book. If you want to produce reference material for your audience, create a handout—which most likely should not be in the form of a slide deck—and give that to your audience during the presentation.</li>
<li>Each slide should be simple enough for the audience to understand it in a couple seconds. You don’t want audience members to be reading your slides when they should be listening to you talk.</li>
<li>Slides should contain no more than six items. The human mind can process up to six items incredibly quickly; it takes much longer to process seven or more.</li>
<li>Break up long lists into multiple slides.</li>
<li>Avoid making lists of bullet points. Instead, space out your items in an eye-pleasing grid (no more complex than two-by-three) and use meaningful icons for each item.</li>
<li>Full-bleed images and single, short sentences centered on an otherwise blank slide can be used to highlight important points and stimulate visual interest in the audience.</li>
<li>You are not going to read your slides while you present. Therefore, to keep on track during the presentation, write (and later refer to) speaker notes for each slide that cover your main points.</li>
<li>Rehearse the presentation until you can perform it by only glancing at your speaker notes.</li>
<li>Manage the clock well. Don’t let asides or questions from the audience take up so much time that you cannot cover all your material or properly wrap up at the end.</li>
<li>The best way to project confidence when hit with an unexpected audience question is to smile, speak slowly, and look toward your co-presenters for help.</li>
</ol>

			 <p>My little corner of Micro.blog has not had much to say about the invasion of Ukraine. This is probably a good thing, because it provides me a respite from grim news and unsubstantiated reports from the front lines. If I still had a Twitter timeline to scroll through, I’m certain that it would be full of performative, meaningless platitudes<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and strident back-and-forth arguments from people who (like me) have no bearing on the outcome of the conflict about what should be done about it.</p>
<p>All I can say right now is that the war is very upsetting to me and the news and commentary about it over the past two weeks (starting before the invasion) have been driving me crazy. Reading news reports and scrolling through social media has been especially disquieting to me. I know not everything I see is true. A lot of it is likely to be propaganda from one side of the conflict or the other. The internet is the best disinformation vehicle the world has ever created, and it is not only being used by Russia, it’s being used by Ukraine and everyone else, too. Ukraine may not be doing as well in this war as some of the video clips I have seen would lead me to believe.</p>
<p>Ukrainians are fighting a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_war_theory">just war</a> against an invading force, which makes taking sides in the conflict morally simple. Ukraine clearly does not deserve Putin’s incursion, and has put up a brave and savvy fight so far against it. It is easy to get caught up in how exciting and seemingly effective their defiance is, and to cheer them on in their defense of their democracy. But war is not an action movie. That it started already makes it a tragedy, and no matter the outcome it will end as an even greater one. The scrappy, virtuous underdogs may lose the fight. Their allies’ aide may be insufficient. Their charismatic leader may be killed. The two sides may broker a peace after heavy losses, and leave nothing meaningful resolved. Whatever the outcome is, I think we are all the worse for it.</p>

			 <p>Recently, I converted all of my (very old) academic writing from outdated document formats (WordStar and Microsoft Word 6) to more future-proof formats: either <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> or <a href="https://opendocumentformat.org">OpenDocument</a> format (.odt). While I did not re-read every essay I ever wrote for school during this process, I did notice something in my files that surprised me: From my junior year of high school to my final semester of grad school, I created outlines—full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)">sentence outlines</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>—for all of my papers that were over a few pages in length. I had forgotten that I used that type of outline for more than two important projects in my academic career: my first English thesis project and my last.</p>
<h2 id="my-first-english-thesis-project-wherein-i-learned-about-the-sentence-outline">My first English thesis project, wherein I learned about the sentence outline</h2>
<p>I was first taught (i.e., forced to use) a sentence outline in high school. It was a requirement of my grade 10 English thesis project, which was a 10-page research and literary criticism paper. At the time, I understood how to create high-level outlines pretty well, but could not understand why I would create an outline that contained full sentences of the essay I was trying to write. I figured that if I could write a sentence outline for an essay, I could just as easily (or more easily) write the essay itself. In grade 10, that is precisely what I did: I wrote the essay and then split apart every paragraph and every sentence into a hierarchical outline. In doing so, I learned almost nothing.</p>
<h2 id="my-last-english-thesis-project-wherein-i-mastered-the-sentence-outline">My last English thesis project, wherein I mastered the sentence outline</h2>
<p>For my final English thesis project, my senior honors thesis in English at Brandeis University, I resorted to a sentence outline to solve my writer’s block. It was a year-long, independent study project, and my thesis advisor—who mostly told me that despite my anxiety I was doing fine—was not terribly helpful or available. Understandably, I lacked direction. I had no idea how to write a big, scary, and academically significant 80-100 page essay. When I sat down to write, I would either produce a jumbled mess of thoughts and quotations that did not fit together, or I would compose a coherent paragraph that I could not connect to anything else I wrote. As my senior year went by, I felt as if I was falling further and further behind my brilliant, thesis-writing peers. Counterintuitively (or understandably, depending on how you look at it), this feeling of dread led me to procrastinate instead of write.</p>
<p>In the early spring, I realized that if I created an outline, I could work on my big, scary thesis essay without actually writing it. To that end, I split the work that had been going nowhere into two Word documents: (1) a simple, high-level outline that consisted of just a few headings at the start; and (2) an unorganized junk drawer of ideas and quotations from my source material. Outlining quickly became a productive form of procrastination for me. Instead of writing my essay, I would pluck out ideas from my junk-drawer document and drop them into the outline. From there, I would change these ideas, move them around, flesh them out, add to them, or delete them, all without committing to their precise wording or location. Because these ideas were all sentences or block quotes, my outline necessarily became a sentence outline.</p>
<p>Using keyboard shortcuts I no longer remember, I collapsed sections and paragraphs of my thesis outline and moved them up and down to organize my ideas, and I shifted individual sentences up and down to make my arguments clearer and easier to understand. Because I was avoiding the writing phase of my project, I avoided gluing my sentences together with logical-, narrative-, or stylistic flow until I felt sure they were in the right place in the document and in the right order in their paragraph. Doing so took some time to get used to, but granted me a feeling of tremendous freedom as I worked out the essay’s high-level structure and the fleshed out the arguments I was advancing within it.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize until I was finalizing my thesis—when my outline was a 100-page outline full of section headings, topic sentences, and body sentences organized into paragraph-level nodes—that I was doing <em>exactly</em> what I was supposed to do. I had organized my research and my findings in a format that was incredibly flexible, and I was constantly revising it and shaping it into something coherent. By accident, I had finally learned why a sentence outline is useful: It explodes an essay into individual thoughts that are physically separate<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and logically atomic<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Doing so makes it easier to evaluate each one independently and—with a good word processor—to quickly group, ungroup, reorder, and move them into place.</p>
<p>In the end, I never wrote my thesis paper. Instead, over the course of a few months, I wrote a sentence outline. I converted it to a manuscript only a day or two before I turned in the final draft. My only edits to it, in manuscript form, were related to applying Word styles to the various paragraphs and adding a title page. The <a href="https://mjdescy.me/pdf/new-directions-thesis.pdf">final draft</a> must have been pretty good because it was awarded the Doris Brewer Cohen Award for best senior honors undergraduate thesis in the humanities at Brandeis University.</p>
<h2 id="in-grad-school-and-beyond">In grad school and beyond</h2>
<p>I went to business school after college, and did not have to write nearly as many long papers to earn my M.B.A. as I did to earn my undergraduate English degree. Despite the small number of major papers I wrote, and despite not remembering the writing process I followed for them, I discovered that I wrote sentence outlines for each one.</p>
<p>After grad school, almost all of my long-form writing has been technical writing for work. While I do not have any old drafts lying around, I recall using outlines extensively to plan and structure my work, but I never again used sentence outlines to draft and perfect it. One reason for that may be that I used different software to write with: mostly plaintext editors, rarely Word (not until I had a first draft nearly completed), and never a dedicated outliner like OmniOutliner. Another reason is that much of my technical writing had to fit into pre-existing document templates that already consisted of many short sections laid out in a specific, required order.</p>
<p>After discovering my longer-than-remembered history of using sentence outlines, and reminiscing about the senior honors thesis project on which I mastered the use of them, I now wonder if I should go back to using them for my larger writing projects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Major League Baseball canceled the first two series of the 2022 regular season on Tuesday after the league and the players’ union failed to reach a new collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>After nearly a year of negotiating, including nine straight days of talks between the league and the union in Florida starting Feb. 21, the sides could not come to a new pact by M.L.B.’s self-imposed deadline of 5 p.m. Tuesday in order to begin the 162-game season on March 31 as scheduled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I strongly considered getting back into following baseball after two years away from the sport. Watching Spring Training games on MLB.TV has always been my way to get excited for the both the new baseball season and for the upcoming warm spring and summer weather. Now, with no clear idea when baseball season will start and a shortened season to look forward to, I’m not so sure I want to bother.</p>

			 <p>I have been doing fairly well at work this month, but I feel kind of terrible about it. I feel like I am falling short in terms of productivity every day. Part of it is that I have been spending a lot more time <em>managing</em> than <em>doing</em>. I am keeping abreast of what my team needs, at the expense of getting my own tasks completed.</p>
<p>I probably won’t be able to prioritize my tasks as well as I would like to for the next two of three months. To regain some feeling of control, however, I will go back to a technique that I have often employed when I am unsure of myself: starting each work day with a journal entry in which I list my priorities for the day.</p>

			 <p>The poet often sits upon the edge of reason, testing the waters of both sides with both his hyperactive poet-senses and his nightmarishly sluggish normal-senses. Treading both sides for a time, he realizes both of these seas are just as cold and just as briny, but the one just beyond reason is far deeper. With this, he dives in, drinking deep, closing his eyes beneath the surface, coughing up the salt when he bobs up for air.</p>
<p>The internal battle begins between the all-knowing and the not-caring, between divulging too many secrets and sharing too little of what he knows; it promises to rend him in two. This is the curse of the poet. And that of the saint. To see so much, and know so little, and yet grasp an understanding far beyond the rest of the world.</p>
<p>At his worst, the poet sits high up above the world and showers his insight down upon it. At his best, he sits high above the world and pulls the rest of it up to him.</p>

			 <p>Modernity is a thin veneer over thousands of years of baser and humbler human history. Almost everything we take for granted today—like electricity, telecommunications, antibiotics, vaccines, knowledge of the internals of the atom, an understanding of DNA, the discovery of plate tectonics, limited space travel, microchips, complex computer modeling, the internet, and so on—was invented or discovered within the span of two or three lifetimes.</p>
<p>When I was a little kid, some of the things I was taught in science class had only been discovered or agreed upon within the past twenty years. A lot more things, such as nuclear energy and weapons, had been invented or discovered in the prior fifty years. As a six-year-old first-grader in the 1980s, fifty years ago may as well have been five-hundred; I couldn’t understand how <em>new</em> everything was around me. For instance, I didn’t realize that my dad had been born before the atomic bomb had been invented. Just today I learned that he was born even before helicopters, which he helped manufacture throughout most of his career, were invented.</p>
<p>It is absolutely astonishing to be alive at such a time, when the past hundred years or so invented nearly everything around us, and we expect new scientific discoveries and new inventions practically every week. It is also very troubling that humans, after only such a short time enjoying the fruits of our ingenuity, seem to be unable to focus on and solve the climate crisis that modernity caused. I fear that thousands of years of baser and humbler human history could return to us at some point in the future if we do not learn to work together to preserve our planet.</p>

			 <p>When I first started work as a systems analyst I knew nothing about business and nothing specific about systems, but I knew a lot about language. I realized early on in my career that technical and non-technical people approach problems so differently that they are, in many cases, not even speaking the same language. In meetings between the business team and the IT team, I would always either start the meeting, or steer the meeting toward, defining common terms for both sides to use to talk about the problem. It is a tactic I still employ a lot to this day, especially when people seem confused about what the problem is or when the conversation isn’t going anywhere.</p>

<p>We have been there four times now, and have discovered new things to see and marvel at every time we have visited. I took a bunch of great shots of the family today, but for my blog I will only post pictures of some of the cool sculptures we saw there.</p>

			 <p>Tonight I performed some surgery on my color laser printer’s empty toner cartridges and installed knock-off ones in their place. I feel a little dirty, but I saved about $400.</p>
<p>I resent that toner cartridges now have microchips in them that are required for the printer to print. The chips help the printer report its toner levels, but otherwise are there to make a rather generic toner cartridge into into something proprietary and overpriced. The knock-off toner cartridges I bought came with tools and instructions for transferring the chips from the original printer cartridges to them. It was pretty easy to do, and the printer prints in color again with the new cartridges installed.</p>
<p>The printer will always report low toner now, no matter what the toner level actually is. I expect to field questions about it from my family for the rest of my life.</p>

			 <p>At my job, we use Webex and Jabber and Microsoft Office 365 for messaging and collaboration, but email is still king. Over the years I have organized my emails by year, project, and client using the various tools that Microsoft Outlook provides: folders (sometimes nested), categories (which are tags with names and color coding), and flags. Recently, I have simplified my filing system to use no categories, no flags, and only four essential folders:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inbox</li>
<li>Archive</li>
<li>@Action</li>
<li>@Now</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Inbox</strong> is self-explanatory; it’s where all my emails enter the system. From there, I pick out messages that are really to-do items and move them to the <strong>@Action</strong> folder. I set up a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/automate-common-or-repetitive-tasks-with-quick-steps-b184f89f-3738-4562-96de-c0244ea830f2">Quick Step</a> to perform this with a single click or keyboard shortcut. I move every other email<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to the <strong>Archive</strong> folder. Thankfully, Outlook 365 has a toolbar button that makes this a one-click operation.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I spend most of my email time looking through the <strong>@Action</strong> folder, which normally has between 5 and 25 emails in it, for emails related to my next task. From there, I move all emails associated with that task to the <strong>@Now</strong> folder. I keep those messages in the <strong>@Now</strong> folder as I perform the task, refer to them as reference material as I perform the task, and reply to at least one of them to complete my task. After I complete the task, I move all the emails in the <strong>@Now</strong> folder to the <strong>Archive</strong> folder. If I am interrupted in the middle of a task for more than a few minutes, I will move all the messages in the <strong>@Now</strong> folder back to the <strong>@Action</strong> folder.</p>
<p>I try not to let any of the folders, except for <strong>Archive</strong>, end up with a glut of emails in them for too long. Outlook’s email search capabilities are capable enough to allow me to find anything I need in my <strong>Archive</strong> folder quickly enough for me not to need to organize archived messages in any way.</p>
<p>Overall, this system has been working well for me and I plan to continue to use it in the future.</p>

			 <p>I tend to minimize good things that happen to me, but am trying to change that. To that end, here is a list of small wins for me this week.</p>
<ol>
<li>I got a complimentary email about my productivity guide, <a href="https://plaintext-productivity.net">PlainText Productivity</a>.</li>
<li>I got a complimentary email about my free call blocking app for iOS, <a href="https://simplecallblockerapp.com">Simple Call Blocker</a>.</li>
<li>I responded to a bug report in my todo.txt app, <a href="https://swiftodoapp.com">SwiftoDo</a> for iOS, fixed the bug, and published the update.</li>
<li>I recently resumed work on the next version of SwiftoDo for iOS. It uses the Swift Package Manager for dependencies, rather than CocoaPods.</li>
<li>In Xcode, I learned how to override a Swift package with a local copy of the package to make editing and debugging to the package code much easier<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>My Chess Elo rating for daily chess on <a href="https://www.chess.com">Chess.com</a> rose to over 800.</li>

			 <p>The worst part of memory is its selectiveness. I can remember, in excruciating detail, every embarrassing moment, every incidence of social awkwardness, every chance I should have taken but didn’t, every blunder or pratfall, every mistake on an important exam, every poorly written paper, every taunt hurled at me, and every dressing down I ever received. I wish I could say that I remember all the successes and great things in my life just as vividly, but it simply is not true.</p>
<p>From what I gather, the way my mind works is entirely normal. I wonder if all it takes to remember all the winning moments in life just as well as the embarrassing ones is to make the effort to do so. For some reason—human nature, I always figured—it feels much harder to celebrate the wins than to mull over the losses.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One of the bad parts of moonlighting as a programmer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> is that, at the time of day I can code, I am often a terrible inefficient coder.</p>
<p>The time I have available for coding is very late at night, typically 11 PM to 1 AM. For the most part this is fine. I can’t get to sleep until 1 AM or later most nights, no matter what I do, and going to bed before I feel tired is counterproductive. Rather than staring at a ceiling in bed for hours, it is far better for me to stay up doing something I enjoy, like coding on my Mac while listening to music on my headphones.</p>
<p>Lately I have noticed that I am getting very little done in these coding sessions. The night before last I fixed one tricky bug, then decided to quit coding (but not yet go to sleep) for the night. Last night I wrote about half of one feature. To be fair, I wrote several implementations of the feature until I found one that would be most compatible with Apple’s frameworks. Still, I quit for the night before finishing it because the other part of the feature seemed too tricky to tackle after midnight.</p>
<p>Fortunately, when I brain is tired, I don’t end up coding a buggy mess. I have the sense to slack off for the rest of the night, so I don’t spend my next evening throwing away the garbage I coded the night before. Still, I get very little done compared to the time I spend on it. At least I enjoy the time I spend doing it.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/01/sports/tom-brady-retires#tom-brady-retirement-nfl">Tom Brady finally retired today</a>.</p>
<p>For most of my adult life, I was a football fan. The whole time, my love of the game sat uncomfortably beside my real concerns about how dangerous it is.</p>
<p>In the 1990s and early 2000s, there was some false controversy about whether the NFL was dangerous to the athletes who played in it. I never got caught up in it: I was always certain football was a dangerous sport. As a kid, my parents said they wouldn’t let me play tackle football. (They didn’t have to worry.) My high school fielded no football team (at least in my first one or two years), nor did my college for the same reason: Back when both schools fielded football teams, kids died of injuries on the field.</p>
<p>Still, a combination of learning about the strategy of the game from <em>Madden</em> games and John Madden broadcasts with his telestrator and the fact that almost everybody around me was a football fan led me to become a fanatic myself. As a New Englander, the Patriots were my default football team. It was not much fun watching them, though, until Tom Brady took over as quarterback. Watching the Brady/Belichick team outsmart and outplay opponents was a little like watching an expert play <em>Madden</em>: thrilling if you are a fan, and boring for everyone else. Football games catalyzed house parties, bar nights, conversations with friends, minor holidays, and generally acceptable excuses to eat junk food, drink beer, and do almost nothing on the weekends.</p>
<p>I promised myself I would stop paying attention to football when Tom Brady retired. I actually gave it up a few years ago, before Brady even moved to the Buccaneers. At some point, I could no longer ignore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NFL_players_with_chronic_traumatic_encephalopathy">the dangers of CTE</a> or the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/feature/wp/2013/05/16/do-no-harm-retired-nfl-players-endure-a-lifetime-of-hurt/">horrible physical toll</a> that professional football puts on athlete’s bodies. Watching the big hits on the field became dreadful rather than exiting. Seeing injured players carted off the field became so upsetting I could no longer shrug it off after the inevitable commercial break.</p>
<p>I fell out of love with the sport entirely. I no longer want to watch any sport where people intentionally hurt each other. Instead of helping me have a good time, seeing people battered on the field—or long after they stopped playing the game—now makes me sad.</p>

			 <h2 id="you-arent-the-best-youre-not-even-close-and-thats-ok">You aren’t the best. You’re not even close. And that’s OK.</h2>
<p>I love chess now, but I am not very good at it. When I first got into it again, however, I thought I was hot stuff. I beat a bunch of bots with higher and higher ratings until I reached what I thought my level was (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo</a> 1,000). I thought that was a pretty good rating for me, considering I hadn’t played in 20 years.</p>
<p>When I started playing humans, however, I discovered that I am not a 1,000-level player at all. It was humbling. Since then I learned that I am not along. There are players at every level striving to learn the game and get better. Despite my early hubris, I am still a beginner. There is nothing wrong with that. We are all beginners at something.</p>
<p>I am having fun learning the game, and think that I am establishing basic competence. That alone is something to be proud of. I have also made an internet friend (or chess rival!), have introduced the game to my son and daughter, and am playing online games with my father-in-law, too. All of these things have made my life better than it was before.</p>
<p>I hope that my interest in the game remains high enough to play a little each day, and to continue to develop my skills. While I will certainly never become a grandmaster (Elo 2,500 and up), perhaps I will become a level 1,000 player someday. I may even remain a beginner for the rest of my life, and that’s OK.</p>
<p>For now, I just want to learn the game and have fun playing it. In broader terms, I want to use the skills I have—however meager they are—to participate, contribute, and have fun.</p>

			 <p>I have been <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2022/01/25/converting-my-old.html">converting my high school essays</a> from their <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/borked">borked</a> Word .doc format to Markdown, to preserve them for future readability. So far, I have converted my ninth grade work and half of my tenth grade work.</p>
<p>As I go, I don’t read each essay in depth, but I have read some of them and found them to be incredibly, unmistakably <em>me</em>. I could have written them yesterday—even my very first high school paper. Sure, I would have made fewer spelling mistakes and would have employed the <a href="https://punctuationmarks.org/em-dash/">em-dash</a> (which I did not know how to type at the time) a lot more, but, for the most part, I would make the same writing decisions now as I made back then.</p>
<p>It has been unnevering to see that I already knew how to write pretty well as a newly minted high school freshman. It makes me worry that I have not grown that much as a writer since then.</p>
<p>I am certain, however, that I have grown much as a thinker and as an organizer of information. Writing long papers in college and grad school (20+ pages) encouraged me to prioritize structure over style, to plan my writing process, and to organize the work and pre-work that goes into writing each section. In my career I developed technical writing skills that built off these concepts and techniques. Lastly, as I shifted more into non-technical work in my career, I also developed an intense focus on clarity, which can only gained through experience writing for many people over a long time period.</p>

			 <h2 id="take-your-time">Take your time</h2>
<p>I have played most of my chess games against the bots found on <a href="https://www.chess.com">Chess.com</a>. When playing against a bot, it will make its moves instantly. It is tempting to keep pace with it. You shouldn’t.</p>
<p>Unlike bots, humans—especially those of us who are not chess masters—need time to look at all the pieces on the board, weigh different moves against each other, and consider both the good and the bad outcomes that would come from each move. If that sounds like a lot of things to do for every move, that’s because it is. Chess is a complex game, which is what makes it so fascinating.</p>
<p>My worst mistakes on the chessboard have been due to hasty decision-making: I want to capture a piece or put the king in check so badly that I don’t bother looking at what moving that piece might do, or without figuring out all the ways my opponent can escape or counter it. I play with haste mostly to match the tempo of my opponent. Maintaining the pace is not important at all—at least at the beginner level I am playing at—and is impossible against a bot anyway. It is a habit I am working to outgrow.</p>
<p>If you are a chess beginner like me and want to improve your game, don’t be hasty. Stop and think before you make a move. Consider what effect that move will have on the future. And weigh multiple options if you have them. These are good rules of thumb not just for chess, but for life, too.</p>

			 <p>Last week I started using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/fancyzones">FancyZones</a>, one of Microsoft’s PowerToys for Windows, on my work computer. I think I love it.</p>
<p>FancyZones lets you create a tiled window layout and snap windows into pre-defined zones (or areas on your screen) via drag-and-drop. It makes it easy to divide your monitor into halves or thirds and arrange multiple windows neatly. Compared to manually sizing and placing multiple windows, it is much faster to snap them all into place by dragging them anywhere onto a zone or by typing a keyboard shortcut.</p>
<p>A tiled window layout is useful for arranging multiple apps for drag-and-drop, or for keeping multiple documents or apps visible at the same time. While it does limit where you can place windows on your screen, it is flexible and easy to adjust the layout. At any time you can call up a zone editor via a hotkey (Shift+Win+`). You can set presets for the different arrangements you like, and switch between them quickly.</p>
<p>FancyZones really clicked for me when I figured out that it can be configured to take over for the default <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/snap-your-windows-885a9b1e-a983-a3b1-16cd-c531795e6241">window snapping</a> feature’s keyboard shortcuts. Now I have windows shuffling between zones set up across my two screens using Win+Left and Win+Right key commands. I can still maximize with Win+Up whenever I need to, and then restore down with Win+Down as well.</p>
<p>Another neat feature of FanzyZones is that every zone represents a stack of windows. You can cycle through the windows in the currently-focused zone with keyboard shortcuts (Win+Up and Win+Down). These shortcuts are very useful because they operate on a smaller set of windows than the Alt+Tab or Win+Tab switchers do. It is much quicker to page through three or four windows within a zone than to go through all ten or twenty I have open system-wide.</p>
<p>If you are curious about tiled windows layouts, and you are a Windows user, I recommend checking out FancyZones. It is free, published by the platform vendor (Microsoft), and is even <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys">open source</a>.</p>

			 <p>Last night I started converting the essays I wrote in high school from the old Microsoft Word .doc format to Markdown, so they will be readable as long as plain text files are readable. My process is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Word .doc in LibreOffice.</li>
<li>Copy the text and paste it into Ulysses</li>
<li>Replace double-spaces after periods with single spaces.</li>
<li>Fix all the paragraph breaks, using the version opened in LibreOffice as a guide.</li>
<li>Fix all the italics that were dropped in the copy/paste operation, again using the version opened in LibreOffice as a guide.</li>
<li>Create a title and a brief heading (with the document date and the subject I wrote it for, if they are in there) in Ulysses.</li>
<li>Run a spell-check in Ulysses.</li>
<li>Export the document from Ulysses to a Markdown file.</li>
<li>Close and delete the Word .doc version.</li>
</ol>
<p>Strangely, many of my essays have no titles. LibreOffice displays a blank page and some random junk at the top of every file. This leads me to believe that my paper headings—which were required, because I wrote them for school—have been lost in file format translation somewhere. I have been adding titles to my old papers, which is challenging sometimes because I have no idea why I wrote some of them.</p>
<p>I found some interesting files in my archive that are actually worth preserving: humorous essays from my freshman year; serious papers about nuclear power and Chernobyl; and brief biographies I wrote of my father and grandfather, which are now treasures to me because they died years ago. I also found a some topical essays full of ten-dollar words and purple prose that I no doubt learned how to write by reading syndicated newspaper columnists every day. The teachers who read them must have thought I was precocious and possibly insane.</p>
<p>Overall, converting these files has been a rewarding diversion from my normal computing tasks. Unfortunately, between high school and college essays, I have hundreds of these Word .docs to convert, so I will be at it for a long time.</p>

			 <p>Last night when I fished a high school essay out of my archives, I was dismayed to find that all my old word processor documents related to school are still saved in the antiquated Microsoft Word .doc format. The file format is now so old that none of the word processors I had installed—not even the online version of Microsoft Word—could open them. I was pretty sure for a moment that all my old work, which I have retained in my document folder for decades, had been lost.</p>
<p>I was especially dismayed by this because I thought I had already solved this problem for myself years ago. Several times in my life I have converted all (or at least large amounts of) my writing from outdated formats, such as WordStar and WordPerfect 5, to more modern ones—just so I could continue to open them. All the .doc files I am complaining about were actually converted from WordStar to Word format by a Windows app called WordPort.</p>
<p>Eventually, I figured out that I could open the old Word doc on a PC using the desktop version of Microsoft Office 365. Of course, the document looked like trash when I opened it. The left margin was nonexistent and Word’s automatic hyphenation messed up the spelling of a bunch of the words. At least I could read it. (While writing this post, I realized that I could have installed LibreOffice Vanilla on my Mac, which still has support for opening Word .doc files, instead.)</p>
<p>When I first started converting my documents to current formats, open formats and plaintext markup languages like Markdown did not exist. The second time I converted some of my documents forward I used OpenOffice, and stored the new files in OpenOffice .odt format, which is an open standard. I am now considering doing a third and final conversion, and moving as much of my old writing as possible to the lowest common denominator file format: plain text. Markdown exists to preserve all the formatting I need for most of my school papers. OpenOffice’s .odt format will have to suffice for the long, complex, overly-formatted and paginated papers I wrote in college.</p>

			 <p>When I find myself struggling to be creative or productive, I always think of a story I read in Annie Dillard&rsquo;s <em>The Writing Life</em>. It was about a rower who was pulled out to sea one evening by the ocean tide. He rowed and rowed all night and kept being pulled farther and father from land by the ebbing tide. In the morning, however, the direction of the tide reversed, and he was pushed back to the shore to safety.</p>
<p>I remember this story so vividly because I had to write a very short essay about the book in my A.P. English class. We had to answer three specific questions about the book in one paragraph each. The teacher stressed how important it was for this assignment to be brief; only one page and three paragraphs.</p>
<p>I chose to answer the last question by writing about the story of the rower. Unfortunately, my explanation of the rower’s story stretched to two whole paragraphs, making my essay far longer than the one-page limit. At that time in my life, I had no idea how to pare down my writing even if it meant cutting parts of it I liked. I agonized over how to cut it down, but decided, uneasily, to turn it in as it was, despite it exceeding the one-page limit.</p>
<p>Happily, my overlong essay was a big success. I may have I understood the story of the rower better than even the teacher did, because the day after I turned it in he began the class but projecting my essay—all two pages of it—onto the classroom’s pull-down screen, and asking the whole class to read it. He seemed genuinely touched by it, too.</p>
<p>This evening I pulled the essay out of my archives to reproduce below. The last two paragraphs are about the rower. I think about the ideas expressed in them on a weekly basis to this day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Approach to <em>The Writing Life</em> by Annie Dillard (20th century [1980s])</p>
<p>Michael Descy</p>
<p>AP English</p>
<p>10/26/95</p>
<p>A main theme of Annie Dillard&rsquo;s <em>The Writing Life</em> is the importance of overcoming all the difficulties faced in the fulfillment of one&rsquo;s dreams. The life of a writer can be dark and lonely, demanding much introspection and many late nights alone with an unruly manuscript. The writing process itself is difficult beyond most people&rsquo;s conceptions. It is so harrowing, so haphazard, and so time consuming that most people that have one burning idea for a particular novel or story are never able to actually follow through its capitalization. Most never really even start, and the few who do often form such an attachment to their work, because it was so hard for them to accomplish, they will not allow themselves to alter it in any way, even to tie up loose ends or discard the beginnings of dropped themes and plot turns. Thus, their piece is never perfected; their dream is left to waste. Despite all these trials, however, writing is a very rewarding activity. Writing is like a passion eating at you, an aching, a hunger that can kill if not satiated. Only persistence, slogging through the murk and endless toil of the process, will enable one to fulfill his dream.</p>
<p>A dominant tone of the work can be described as enthusiastic. Dillard is intense as she explains the writing process. She describes writing in exhilarating terms, comparing it to playing tennis, lion taming, and stunt flying. Her metaphors are powerful, zesty. She shows your work as a line of words pulsing through your bloodstream and shooting across the universe. She tells us committing a vision to paper is a futile fight with the jealous, tyrannical page, the forces of time and matter working against you. Her chapters are choppy, broken down into many vignettes and tiny observations. There is a break on almost every page. They are so frequent each seems to be a gasp of breath between her quickly blurted images.</p>
<p>A strong scene that feels as though it will provide a good doorway for thoughtful attention to an important aspect of the work is the story of Ferrar Burn, which her painter friend, Paul Glenn, told her. One evening, years ago, Ferrar Burn caught sight of an eight-foot log of Alaska cedar floating out in the channel by his house. It was high tide, the water slack, so he rowed out, tied the log to his little eight-foot pram, and proceeded to tow it in. The tide turned, however, catching him, pulling him farther and farther out to sea. But Burn kept rowing against the tide, stubbornly, obstinately towards his house. He strained against it all night to little avail. When the tide finally changed the next morning, it finally pushed the still-rowing Ferrar Burn back home.</p>
<p>This scene connects very well to the aforementioned theme. Through persistence against terrible odds, the rower Burn was finally able to succeed. Had he given up, stopped rowing, he would have drifted so far out to sea that the tide change which eventually pulled him back in would not have helped him. A writer too must pull against opposing forces to accomplish his or her goal. There is much about the process that pushes people away. Most would just assume go along with the tide, take the easy route, and be led far away from their dream. But the few with the dogged insistence to stick with their craft, pull through their troubles, and never lose sight of their objectives are able to ride out the tough times and sail swiftly and smoothly through the good times. These few are steeply rewarded in the end. Their prize: accomplishment of a dream.</p>

			 <p>I have been having trouble lately coming up with something to say each day on my blog. I am feeling somewhat uninspired. This lack of spark probably stems from spending many hours this past week (far more than usual) writing software. The many hours spent programming have taxed my brain so much that the acts of writing, doing chores, or doing my other day-job work have felt exhausting and unrewarding for the past few days.</p>
<p>The reason I have a blog is that I want to write every day, even when it feels impossible to put anything down, even when I feel I have nothing to say, and even if nobody else reads it. My goal is to practice explaining my ideas and opinions, developing ideas, and telling stories. Doing it every day is important to me because I have given up my creative endeavors too easily in the past. Stories seem impossible to end. A good song seems impossible to write. A buggy app seems impossible to fix. No one really cares about the things I create anyway, so why bother finishing them?</p>
<p>I have a different mindset now. A blog is never “finished” so I can’t fail at completing it. Conversely, a blog post is very short, so it is easy to finish. More importantly, it no longer matters to me if anyone else reads it. If someone does read one of my posts and leaves me a comment on Micro.blog, I am very flattered, but it doesn’t really matter. The blog is a <em>kata</em>. Practicing the forms is key. Nothing matters more.</p>

			 <p>Earlier this week I played through <a href="http://imageform.se/game/steamworld-dig/#"><em>Steamworld Dig</em></a> on the Nintendo Switch. I bought it for a song during Nintendo’s New Years sale, and I found it well worth it. It is a high-quality game with a fun—and brief—game loop. First you explore the mine and collect treasure, then you return to town to sell the treasure and purchase upgrades. There isn’t any more to it, unfortunately, but the gameplay is fun nonetheless.</p>
<p>A while ago I played through the sequel, <a href="http://imageform.se/game/steamworld-dig-2/#"><em>Steamworld Dig 2</em></a>, which bests the first game in every way imaginable, including turning it into a full-fledged <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania">Metroidvania</a>. If can pick up only one of the two, <em>Steamworld Dig 2</em> is the one to get.</p>

			 <p>Back in 2006, I bought a Nintendo DS and was fanatical about the game <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_Age:_Train_Your_Brain_in_Minutes_a_Day%21">Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day</a></em>. It was a game that promised to make you mentally sharper, as long as you did solved simple cognitive training puzzles every day.</p>
<p>For several months I played it daily, for five minutes or so, before I watched TV or played a more conventional video game. I told everybody about it. My best friend was a fan, too. After several weeks, I became blazingly fast at most of its puzzles, which included performing simple arithmetic, memorization, and doing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect">Stroop Color and Word Test</a>. (The Stroop test was the hardest for me, due in no small part to my red/green color-blindness.) At the time, I thought that the daily training was making me smarter. Aside from being able to calculate restaurant tips more quickly, however, I noticed no other intellectual gains.</p>
<p>After some time, I stopped playing <em>Brain Age</em>—at least the brain training part. I had read that it didn’t really improve your cognitive abilities, and had come to the same conclusion myself by that point. Despite that conclusion, I still believe that playing games can make you smarter. That’s why I picked up Sudoku (which was included in <em>Brain Age</em>), the <em>New York Times</em> crossword puzzle, and, more recently, chess. I also do computer programming as a hobby, which is a little like playing a game against the compiler sometimes.</p>
<p>I play all these games to stave off what I fear is inevitable in my old age: mental decline. It think it is inevitable because I watched it happen to my father. At the tail end of his career (he worked until age 75), his mind started slipping away, little by little. I thought it was because he no longer had challenging work to do. Eventually, he developed dementia, and it became clear that the cause was medical in nature.</p>
<p>I realize now that I played <em>Brain Age</em> at the very start of his decline. Perhaps it was the trigger. I also realize that I still want there to be something I can do—mentally, that is—so that I don’t end up with the same fate.</p>

			 <p>I taught my four-year-old son how to play chess a couple days ago. It was his idea. He was curious about it because I have been talking about chess with my wife, and because our chess board is on the underside of the Chinese checkers set we have been playing with as a family.</p>
<p>He and I played a few games over the holiday weekend. This afternoon, he played with his grandmother and grandfather, which was his idea. This evening, when I suggested we play checkers, he cried because he wanted to play chess. (Of course we could play chess instead of checkers.) He learned how all the pieces moved (except for castling and <em>en passant</em>) in one quick lesson. I am trying to teach him about checkmate now. It is great fun to have something new to do with him. I look forward to teaching my daughter now to play, too.</p>

			 <p>I spent all day coding in VBA for work. I’m creating Excel templates for data submissions. These templates need (at least <em>I</em> think they need) data validation routines that the people filling them out can run. Those routines will help prevent some data quality problems down the line.</p>
<p>The only tool for the job to code those routines is VBA, which is bar far the oldest language I code in on a regular basis. It is creaky, feature-limited, and its runtime is rather unstable. But if it works well enough for federal agencies (I have seen some data input forms in my time), it will work for me.</p>
<p>I used to think VBA was a trash language, and only trash code could be made from it. Once I learned I was stuck with it for certain tasks, though, I tried to make the most of it. Now I treat VBA like the proper object-oriented language it is. The result is that I have a lot more fun writing it, and I think that the code is easier to debug and modify in the future, too.</p>
<p>I keep my code clean. I keep methods as short as possible. I use long, descriptive names for methods, classes, and variables. I structure the code into classes extensively. I create classes for intermediate data structures to make other parts of my VBA code easier to understand. I refactor my code into numerous smaller classes when I find I am writing too many, or overly complex, private methods. I create and use factories to create and set up objects. I apply the principle of least privilege everywhere. I am pedantic about whether arguments are passed by reference or by value. I even use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/Language/Reference/User-Interface-Help/implements-statement">interfaces</a> sometimes, too.</p>
<p>The result is code that is rigorously structured—perhaps hilariously so to the next person who will look at it. It is unlike any VBA code I have ever seen before, but it is probably a lot like many VB6 applications written in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>Several days ago, <a href="https://canion.omg.lol">@canion</a> challenged me to a game of chess—basically correspondence chess—on <a href="https://www.chess.com">chess.com</a>. I’m pretty sure he is beating me right now, but we are just in the middle of the game, so we will have to play it out to be sure.</p>
<h2 id="simultaneous-online-play">Simultaneous online play</h2>
<p>Tonight I played a real-time game against someone else on chess.com for the first time. I won! Except for the one, slow game with <a href="https://micro.blog/canion">@canion</a>, I haven’t played against a real person in chess for about 20 years. Humans are less predictable than bots, which makes things interesting.</p>
<p>I also found the post-game statistics on the chess.com website to be very interesting. Apparently in my game tonight I made 4 mistakes and 8 blunders, and had 3 missed wins. That means I’m pretty bad at chess! That makes sense to me, considering I just re-started playing about a week ago. To get better, I should probably play more games and then analyze what went wrong in them to figure out what my weaknesses are.</p>
<h2 id="in-person-playsomeday-soon">In person play…someday soon</h2>
<p>Today I ordered a chess set today—a nice, wooden set with weighted pieces that completely outclasses what we have know and the chess set I grew up with. The board has labeled ranks (1-8) and files (a-g), which will be great for teaching my family how to play. It folds in half and has internal storage for the pieces. It also has two extra queens. No chess set that I’ve ever seen had extra pieces to account for pawn promotion, so this set feels luxurious to me. I promised my wife I will use it to teach her how to play. My kids may be interested, too; I don’t look forward to losing to a four-year-old and a nine-year-old, though!</p>

			 <p>I’m pretty sure I re-learned long division tonight as I helped my daughter through her homework assignment.</p>
<p>That was a skill that bedeviled me when I took the GMAT twenty years ago. The GMAT, at that time at least, did not allow for the use of a calculator. To make it worse, none of the figures on the math problems divided evenly. Many of the math problems were painful to get through, not because I didn’t know the math, but because I could not remember how to calculate the final answers with long division. At the time, I was a recent college graduate, and I hadn’t done long division since the seventh grade. I’m pretty sure I got a bunch of questions wrong because I had forgotten how to perform long division. In the end, my math score paled in comparison to my language score, all due to me not remembering, or at least reviewing, long division.</p>
<p>I got A’s and A+’s all throughout business school. I concentrated in finance. Never once did I have to perform calculations without a calculator. Sometimes life—or at least the typical qualification exam—is not fair.</p>

<p>Late tonight I reconfigured my desk setup for the umpteenth time. The main reason is that my last setup revision, which moved my monitor forward and my keyboard and mouse to a pull-out drawer under the desk, left my headphone and stereo amps in a no-mans-land behind my monitor, completely out of reach.</p>
<p>My desk is strange, and I wish I had one or two normal, five-foot-wide rectangular desks in its place. I have a corner desk that is not nearly as wide as I would like, though it does connect to desktop areas of varying utility along each side. (Imagine a V-shaped desk, where the main seating area is at the apex of the V, with a secondary desk area on the left, and a cabinet on the right, all connected together.)</p>
<p>I am planning to add a second monitor to the main area that I use for work. Unfortunately, it is unclear how exactly it would fit comfortably there, but I went ahead and ordered a new monitor anyway. (Both monitors are/will be 4K 27-inch displays.) My plan is to orient it vertically (with a downward tilt so I can read it) to the right of my current monitor. It may look a little weird, and be less useful for me to use on that side, but I don’t have anywhere else to put it.</p>
<p>Oddly, for this setup I moved my work laptop onto the floor. It’s actually on a little five-inch-high shelf I made right that sits on on the floor under my desk, far enough from my chair that I cannot kick it. Fortunately, you can’t see it or the multitude of wires connecting to every side of it, unless you crawl under the desk. I’m sure I will have to do that occasionally to reboot the laptop, but that won’t be too often, and has always been a pain for me to do anyway.</p>
<p>I moved my headphone dac/amp stack right next to my Mac mini, which has its own setup to the left of my work computer’s monitor-and-keyboard setup. Because the path for headphone cords no longer crosses over my keyboard or mouse at either computer, I will be able use it again. (I haven’t been able to use it since the last revision to my desk setup.) I really look forward to that.</p>
<p>My two laptops (one a very old MacBook Pro, the other a relatively new Dell running Windows 11) are now in a drawer. I removed their chargers from their power strip, and they now reside neatly in labeled bags next to the laptops. I just don’t use them that much since I got my Mac mini, and I never plug them into a monitor. It just makes sense for me now to consider them as portable, and to pull them out when I need them and hide them the rest of the time.</p>
<p>Also as part of this revision, I put my high-speed Epson scanner away in a cabinet because I never use it. It’s s shame, because it is very fast. Unfortunately, it isn’t that useful for my scanning needs because I don’t have stacks of letter-size papers to scan. Instead, I usually have a bunch of irregularly sized papers that require a flatbed banner (which I have as part of my multifunction printer).</p>
<p>Now that I am done, I am happy again with it. Everything looks tidy and functional. Adding the second monitor to the work setup will be a challenge for another night.</p>

			 <p>Digital media is a miracle. It is infinitely reproducible with no loss of quality. The internet and all the devices we have make sharing digital media less expensive, on a marginal basis, than was possible via any other technology that came before it. We have invented a way to make some resources—like art and entertainment—effectively unlimited and nearly free.</p>
<p>We take it for granted now, and moneyed interests are busy trying to dismantle it with blockchains as I write this, but I think we should all step back sometime and consider how incredible and wonderful it is. The miracle of digital media isn’t that it can be made finite; it is that it is <em>infinite</em>. We should embrace that miracle rather than try to replace it with something mundane.</p>

			 <p>Thanks to all the checkers games I have been playing with my kids, my mind has turned to the other, better game you can play with the same board: chess. I have been enjoying playing lots of games on <a href="https://chess.com">Chess.com</a>’s iPhone and iPad app, which is part of Apple Arcade. The chess app has an assortment of bots with various skill levels to play against. I quickly plowed through the beginner bots and the first three intermediates. I think that my chess, as someone who has not played chess in 20 years, is probably around 1,000 right now. (That’s the beginning of the “intermediate” level.) I would have to play some real opponents online to find out for sure, and I am not ready to do that yet. I still make too many mistakes, and win too many of my games by clearing the board almost entirely, which doesn’t seem right. I must need more study and practice.</p>
<p>Chess is the only board game I find addicting. It is so addictive to me that, when I first got really into it, I had to quit after a few months. When I was 21, I started playing chess via the ChessMaster game on my PC, which had an excellent teaching mode. I then started playing real people on a chess website that was popular back then. I played many, many games each day. I was pretty good. I would win most of the games I played, presumably against beginners and intermediate players like me, but sometimes I would get beaten soundly. Soon, I couldn’t stop thinking about chess and was playing chess games in my mind all the time. I was losing sleep and couldn’t concentrate on my studies. I had to stop cold turkey, and I never picked it up again until now.</p>
<p>I’m finding myself becoming addicted again. I’m playing games on my iPhone and my iPad whenever I have a few minutes to myself. I am watching YouTube videos for chess instruction. I am thinking of doing daily chess puzzles on my phone, too. So far chess has not taken invaded my thoughts or disturbed my sleep. Then again, I did play a couple games on my iPad instead of reading in bed last night. At any rate, it is fun, and I wish my wife knew how to play or was eager to lean.</p>

			 <p>I advised a colleague today to research <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">web3</a>, because I think it may be the most interesting InsurTech technology of the year. I don’t think that glomming cryptocurrency and smart contracts onto the web is a <em>good</em> use of technology at all. The idea is especially dubious, and that is the reason it is interesting to me. I honestly think that web3, along with the cryptocurrencies that make it possible, are based on a long con.</p>
<p>Web3 appears to be something to make cryptocurrencies, which are useless—except as a speculative asset or a way to pay the criminals who ransomware-attacked you—useful. Web3 will require you to have a digital wallet to pay for and log into any website with a web3-type paywall. The rest of web3 is just another name for smart contracts, which—as far as I can tell—are an interesting idea that has not caught on very well in real-world applications.</p>
<p>Perhaps the scope of both my research and my imagination is too narrow, but I don’t think web3 is going anywhere outside the venture capital community, at least not for a very long time.</p>

			 <p>I am on a mission to replace <a href="https://www.farmanager.com">Far Manager</a>, which is a Windows file manager that I really love, and have used for over a year. Far Manager is a text mode file manager that has been in development since the 1990s. It is a lot like Norton Commander, which I used briefly in my DOS days. I like how fast the UI is, how easy it is to navigate the filesystem, and also how easy it is to read the file and folder names in text mode.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it has a few drawbacks that have been driving me crazy. First, opening Visual Studio Code from it, which I have to do all the time, will often mess up the UI and require a restart. Second, the keyboard shortcuts—many of which I have memorized—are bonkers. The left and right shift keys act as completely different modifiers, and the left and right control keys act the same way. This is not a problem for my standard ANSI keyboard, but I am trying to move to an ortholinear keyboard which doesn’t have two shift keys or two control keys, so some of the functionality I rely on is inaccessible.</p>
<p>Today I found another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager#Orthodox_file_managers">orthodox (two-panel) file manager</a> that runs on Windows, has a full graphical UI, and is very, very customizable. It’s called <a href="https://doublecommander.com">Double Commander</a>. Life Far Manager, it is free, and it has the two-pane interface I love. Unlike Far Manager, you can customize nearly every part of the user interface, including all the keyboard shortcuts. I was able to pare down the default toolbars to a minimum, color the interface to have white text on a navy blue background, and learn the few keyboard shortcuts I need to know without any trouble. Prior to learning about it today, I thought I had tried all the orthodox file managers for Windows. Double Commander is my favorite of the bunch.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobody_(2021_film)"><em>Nobody</em></a> is a surprisingly good action movie. It nails everything there is to nail about the action genre. Specifically, the writing and editing are top notch. The story is set up with great efficiency, and every set-up is paired with a call-back later in the film, which is very satisfying to see. Also, Bob Odenkirk’s acting in it is fantastic.</p>
<p>I will admit that it does play a little like a mashup of <em>The Accountant</em> and <em>John Wick</em>, but I liked it better than either of those two movies that share its genre.</p>

			 <p>My kids are really into playing checkers since winter break. I have played a lot of games with my son and daughter in the past week or so. To get a better handle on the rules and strategies, I also played some games alone on my iPhone (there is an Apple Arcade Checkers game).</p>
<p>Checkers is a game that, until last week, I had not played more than once or twice since I was five. I’m pretty sure I read the rules the first time about a week ago on my son’s checkers set. I never knew that you are forced to capture the opponent’s piece (or pieces) if the opportunity to capture them arises. I don’t think my father or grandfather knew that. I mostly remember card games becoming far more interesting to me soon after I learned how to play (or, actually, not how to play) checkers.</p>
<p>I have realized that the game is deeply flawed. Many games reach an endgame state with a few pieces left (mostly kings) and a wide open board. At that point, unless your opponent makes a mistake, it is impossible to win. Of course, kids and inexperienced players make mistakes, which makes the game more fun. I am teaching my son and daughter checkers strategy when I play with them, and intentionally making mistakes and showing them how the opportunities to jump multiple pieces occur.</p>
<p>I have starting hinting at my kids to play together, too, because they would be on more or less equal footing with each other. The idea hasn’t sunk in yet. Of course I will still play with them, but they have more time available to play.</p>

			 <p>I never imagined she would use it as a camera and fill it with photos and videos. iCloud Photo Library has been enabled from the start, and we have plenty of cloud storage space. Unfortunately, Photos will not free up space no matter what I do. If you delete a photo or video from Photos, it is deleted <em>everywhere</em>, so that is not an option.</p>
<p>Tonight, as I update iOS via tethering the iPad to my Mac, I am weighing my next move. Do I wipe the iPad and set it up as new, which would at least forestall the problem? Or do I simply turn off iCloud sync, wait a while for the photos on the device to be deleted, and then turn it back on? I can’t remember if I have tried the latter before. I think I may wipe the device because my daughter’s notes app has 39 notes and is taking up over a gigabyte of space, too. Strange things are afoot.</p>

			 <p>The Omicron wave has been a source of concern for my family and my town. School systems north of us have pre-emptively closed schools and have gone remote for the week. The school superintendents where I live are adamant that they cannot (or, really, will not) close schools unless (or until) there is a breakout in a particular school building. Because schools have been closed since December 24, there can be no outbreaks inside particular schools.</p>
<p>Early this morning, all the schools in my town were closed for a snow day. Snow is in the forecast, but it has not snowed yet. I think the superintendents took advantage of an iffy weather forecast to close the schools for the day, to push off the whatever outbreaks occur for another day. Parents in town seem to think that the closure has more to due to with teacher- and bus driver shortages than with the weather forecast.</p>

Now I watch their videos to monitor Nintendo eShop sales weekly, and have developed quite a backlog of games.

<h2 id="played">Played</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Metroid Dread</em></li>
<li><em>GRIS</em></li>

<ul>
<li><em>Shantae and the Pirate’s Curse</em></li>
<li><em>Moonlighter</em></li>
<li><em>Children of Morta</em></li>
<li><em>Guacamelee! 2 Complete</em></li>
<li><em>Slay the Spire</em></li>
<li><em>SteamWorld Heist: Ultimate Edition</em></li>
<li><em>SteamWorld Dig</em></li>
<li><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass</em></li>

<li><em>Mana Spark</em></li>
<li><em>Tales of Vesperia: Definitive Edition</em></li>
<li><em>Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I have enough games to keep me busy for a couple years. I could crack a joke and say that I have a game-buying problem, but I am actually happy with this situation. Gaming has become my primary source of entertainment this year. I have fun playing the games I have purchased. And I have a lot of great games in my library to look forward to.</p>

			 <p>My feelings about Christmas are <em>complicated</em>. There are numerous legitimate reasons why, which I won’t go into. But they are there, and they have left me feeling and seeming like a villain in a Christmas movie. I don’t love Christmas (any more). I have heard enough carols. I have seen too many Santa Clauses. I don’t care much for Christmas trees, or elves, or angels. The lights and decorations overwhelm, rather than delight me. I am not proud of this disdain. I disappoints me that I ended up this way.</p>
<p>Still, I have made an effort for today and tomorrow—the second “COVID-ruined” Christmas without travel to the actual Christmas-celebrating side of our family—to be nice for my family. I cooked a big dinner tonight, using an Omaha Steaks package my mom bought us, invited my in-laws over the share it with us, and we had a very nice time. We even played bingo (my kids love bingo) together after dinner. Thanks to a lot of effort from my wife and myself, the bottom floor of our house is clean and ready for more company tomorrow, when my brother-in-law’s family and my in-laws come over. We are having a Jewish Christmas party, I guess, though we will be ordering Kosher deli instead of Chinese food because of my son’s sesame allergy.</p>
<p>Even though we are a Jewish household, I grew up with Christmas, and want my kids to have some special memories associated with it, even if the trappings of Christmas aren’t really for me anymore. I want them to remember that Christ is not about presents and Santa; it’s about family.</p>

<p>I also got a gift card from my employer in the mail, and used it to buy an Apple Magic Trackpad, which is something I have always wanted but could not justify spending the money on.</p>
<p>I am not great at having fun during my time off. My wife and kids have school tomorrow, while I am off, and I plan to spend the morning vacuuming, mopping the floor, and cleaning the bathrooms. Not fun at all, I’m afraid. Once everybody is home, though, I can imagine playing board games and watching movies with my kids. We’re also having family over on Christmas Day. Unfortunately, though, due to COVID and an abundance of caution, we are not traveling to see my mom and the rest of my family on Christmas.</p>

The problems I was facing with it seemed insurmountable. In truth, some of those problems still seem insurmountable, but I feel ready to move forward again with it.</p>
<p>Last night I stayed up late (which happens to me a lot when I am coding) and fixed a build that had been broken since the last time I touched it. I had moved a ton of functionality from a mostly-written app into a Swift package, and the transition necessitated updating hundreds of files and a few dozen method calls or property references. It was tedious work, but now that part is done. The app builds and runs, and the parts that still don’t work seem easy to fix. The <em>new</em> parts I have yet to write will still be a challenge, but I feel up for it now. It feels good to be back at it.</p>

<p>I have seen every Bond film at this point, largely inspired by John Gruber, who famously (in tech circles at least) is a Bond fan. Despite having seen dozens of Bond movies over the years, I don’t consider myself a Bond fan. Most of them are ridiculous and their sexism has obviously not aged well.</p>
<p>I like to think of James Bond as a terrible spy. After all, everybody knows who he is, and he never actually spies on anyone, either. While not a spy, he is instead a sloppy fixer who always managers to get the job done. I also think of him, in most Bond movies anyway, as a sociopath. Over and over again, especially in the earlier Bond movies, he sleeps with women who wind up dead the next day, and appears to be completely unfazed by it. Also, of course, he kills scores of people and never seems to have PTSD let along give it a second thought.</p>
<p>Daniel Craig has a more soulful and less sociopathic take on the character. His Bond’s story arc comes to a close in <em>No Time to Die</em>, which plays out, in many ways, like a tragic love story. Bond is, well, bonded to his love interest (wife?) Madeleine, Madeleine’s daughter Mathilde, and even his CIA friend Felix. Overall, I think the film’s focus on these relationships worked very well.</p>
<p>There were a few points of inconsistent writing when it comes to the two female agents—one of whom, Nomi, is the new 007—who aid Bond in his mission. Nomi’s numerous jokes at Bond’s expense did not land at all, mainly because Daniel Craig looks and acts like a super-man in all the action scenes rather than the creaky old man she insinuates him to be.</p>
<p>The Daniel Craig Bond films always lose me in the third act. This one had some weaknesses that I think all these movies have. For example, I thought villain’s motive to kill millions of people was weak, and that his secret base’s security was especially lackadaisical. Still, the story had personal stakes for Bond (which is a speciality of most or all of the Daniel Craig Bond movies, if I recall correctly), and those stakes held my interest quite a bit.</p>
<p>Overall, despite some minor stumbles in the dialog, I very much enjoyed it. It may be my favorite Bond movie now, or at least sit in my personal top three list alongside _ From Russia with Love_ and <em>The Spy Who Loved Me</em>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>First, my wife decided to keep our oldest child home from school, out of extreme caution related to the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/17/tech/tiktok-school-threat-december-17/index.html">TikTok school shooting challenge</a>, which I immediately dismissed as a hoax. My wife stayed home as well.</p>
<p>At breakfast, my four-year-old son sneezed and coughed once or twice, so I suggested we give him a rapid COVID test before sending him into preschool. He did not seem sick, but I thought we should do the responsible thing. He, being a typical four year old, did not want (loudly!) a cotton swap stuck up his nose at the breakfast table, but we did it anyway, despite his tears. The test confirmed that he was COVID negative, and my wife drove him to preschool shortly after.</p>
<p>I was working by the time my daughter woke up. We let my daughter sleep late, and she woke up crying. She ran into the office and told me she had a nightmare in which she lost her favorite doll. I made her breakfast soon after, during which she complained frequently and loudly that she was missing out on school. With no prompting from me, after she tried to keep to her academic schedule as much as she could, even though she was home.</p>
<p>A couple hours later, in the mid morning, I had to take some time off work to drive to two doctor’s offices and pick up medical records. While I was out driving, my wife called me, saying that my son’s preschool called her saying that our son had thrown up all over and needed to come home. My wife went out to get him, with our daughter in tow.</p>
<p>By lunchtime, we were all back together at home. My son wasn’t coughing or throwing up, but felt very tired and was running a low fever. My wife had already made a doctor’s appointment for him, and planned to take him mid-afternoon while I was working.</p>
<p>At this time, my daughter complained that she was starving, which is very rare. Of course, I had no food to give her, so I had to cook something while she waited, steaming. She complained that she was having a bad day, and explained to me at length what she was supposed to be doing at every hour of the day that had elapsed so far.</p>
<p>By mid-afternoon, I thought things would start to return to normal. Unfortunately, fifteen minutes after my wife left with my son to go to the doctor’s office, she called me saying that her car was making a terrible noise. It was so loud that I could hear it over the phone, over the road noise. I said I thought she had a flat tire (it turns out she did), and I told her to park in the nearest parking lot and wait for me to get her. Of course, I couldn’t just leave by myself—I had to take my daughter…who wasn’t dressed yet and would not get moving as fast as I wanted her to. It took us (her, really, but don’t want to be mean) about twenty minutes to get out of the house. My wife—desperate to make it to my son’s doctor appointment—called me again, <em>livid</em>.</p>
<p>On our drive to my wife’s car, just before reaching the highway, a deer that I had noticed in my peripheral vision leapt out onto the street about five feet in front of my car. I slammed on the breaks and barely missed it. Luckily, the car behind me barely missed me as well. Of course, stopping abruptly caused every loose thing in my car, including my daughter’s favorite doll, to fly forward and crash into the my arm, the center console, and even the dashboard.</p>
<p>When we finally got to my wife and son, I saw a completely deflated rear passenger-side tire on her car. She told me she had called AAA, and they would be there in about an hour. She then took our son in my car (we exchanged keys) and drove him to the doctor’s office, about an hour past her appointment time. My daughter and I waited in my wife’s car for help to arrive. My in-laws came in about half an hour and took my daughter away to bring her home. I stayed in my wife’s car for another half hour, waiting for AAA to come. I had thought that they were going to tow the car to a tire shop, but instead they put the space tire on, which I started to wonder if I could have done myself. (I have not changed a tire since I was a teenager, and that was with my dad.)</p>
<p>After AAA put on the spare, I started the car and found it had almost no gas in it. I drove to the nearest service station and filled the tank. Then I drove home. No one was there. When I got to my front door, I realized that my wife’s keyring had no house-key on it. I was locked out of my house. Out of sheer coincidence, at that exact moment, my in-laws drove up my driveway. They had taken my daughter to her art class, went all the way there, and realized that they had forgotten her face mask. To fetch one, they drove her all the way back home. Fortunately, my father-in-law has a house-key, and was able to let me in before they took my daughter, a second time, to her art class.</p>
<p>Almost an hour later, after my wife brought my son home—he was deemed by the doctor to be doing fine, but he has some non-COVID, non-flu virus—she asked me to pick up our daughter from her art class. When I got into my car, I noticed it had no almost gas left (my wife used it up on her trip to the doctor), so I had to squeeze in a fill-up before getting to my daughter’s art school. Fortunately, I made it in time. On our drive home in my car, the low tire pressure warning light came on, meaning I have a soon-to-be flat tire on my car to contend with as well.</p>
<p>It’s going to be a fun weekend after all this.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last night I misplaced my AirPods. I didn’t realize it until this morning, when I always take them off of my dresser and put them in my pocket. At 7:15 AM, they were gone.</p>
<p>I didn’t mind at first. I knew they were at home, because I wore them while I was unpacking the groceries, but I had no idea what became of them. I looked for them at breakfast time, and couldn’t find them. After I finished a project at work this morning I looked again, more thoroughly. They weren’t in any of the usual places I put them. They weren’t in my clothes. They weren’t in the couch cushions.</p>
<p>I started to get worried that something weird had happened to them. Perhaps someone threw them out. Perhaps they had fallen somewhere I could never retrieve them. I started to wonder if I would them years from now when we move out.</p>
<p>By lunchtime, which is when I use my AirPods most often, I started to get desperate. Instead of going for my daily walk, I turned over the entire house looking for them. I started looking for my AirPods in crazy places throughout my house where they never could be: inside the refrigerator, inside various drawers and cabinets, and on the floor between my desk and the wall.</p>
<p>I almost ordered new ones from Amazon, just to make the problem go away. The generation 2 AirPods were at an all-time low price today, but they wouldn’t be delivered until sometime in January, so it didn’t seem worth it. But, I saw that the new generation 3 AirPods could be delivered tomorrow. They just cost about $100 more. I almost bought them, but stopped short because I had to go back to work.</p>
<p>At long last, in the middle of the afternoon, when I decided to prepare a load of towels for the wash, I found them hiding at the bottom of the towel hamper. I have no idea how they fell in there, but I was enormously relieved to get them back.</p>
<p>It’s so silly, isn’t it?</p>

			 <p>Today my group and I presented on InsurTech to for an industry group’s free training day webinar. It went really well, which I expected because it was our second time making the same presentation. Still, I think that we all improved as speakers. We made our points more clearly and more cogently than we did the first time, and did so with greater focus and energy. We did some ad-libbing, answered some questions from the audience, and covered all of our material with only a minimal amount of rushing at the end. The best feeling for me was that I very much enjoyed listening to my speaking partners as they presented their sections.</p>
<p>Overall, I think the presentation went very well. Human nature being what it is, though, I remember the two very minor vocal stumbles I made during the talk more than the thirty minutes of good performance I put into it. I also second-guess whether my reliance on a script—which I was not reading, per se, but did need to remember my lines—makes my part of the talk sound like I am reading an essay, which could be exhausting to listen to. No one has ever said that to me, but I wonder about it just the same.</p>
<p>Working out what I am going to say out loud has always been part of my process when preparing a talk. Writing it down and editing it to exactly what I would want to say is a newer approach, which I think works out very well. It does, however, lead to an unnaturally efficient way of speaking, where no word is wasted—as long as I can remember my script. The next time I present to a live audience, with less accessible speaker notes and interruptions from the audience to handle, will put my new approach to presentations to the test. At this point in the COVID-19 pandemic, though, my next live presentation will likely be somewhat far in the future.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Over the past week I played through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantae_and_the_Seven_Sirens"><em>Shantae and the Seven Sirens</em></a>, which is one of the many games I bought on sale after Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Once I started it, I realized that I already played part of it. In 2019, it (well, a small part of it) was a launch title on Apple Arcade. At the time, I, like most Apple nerds, got the Apple Arcade free trial. I did not click with Apple Arcade. The only game I liked on it at the time was <em>Shantae and the Seven Sirens</em>. That version was my introduction to the Shantae series. After my Apple Arcade trial ended, I bought the next best thing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantae:_Half-Genie_Hero"><em>Shantae: 1/2 Genie Hero</em></a>, on the Switch.</p>
<p>Because I had played part of it in 2019, I decided to play it this time using the original 2019 level of difficulty, rather than in the newer “definitive mode” with “balanced difficulty.” That may have been a mistake, because the game posed no challenge at all. Healing items and magic refills abound, and about 20% of the way through you get a heading dance (which is like a magic spell) that makes healing almost entirely unnecessary.</p>
<p>While not challenging, it was a lot of fun. The game has cute and colorful graphics, a funny and entertaining script, snappy controls, and runs smooth as butter on the Switch.</p>
<p>After I beat it, I started a new game under the “definitive mode”. Right away I found it much harder—harder than I expected, to be honest. I will likely play through it again at this higher difficulty setting and see how I fare.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/12/13/my-data-analysis.html">My data analysis bot</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/12/13/my-data-analysis.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-12-13 20:52:17 -0500">Dec 13, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Today I spent the majority of my work day creating a massive Excel template. Tomorrow I will code the data analysis bot that will fill that template with data tables and command logs that document the analytical procedures. Over time, these two days worth of work are going to save me many, many hours.</p>
<p>I have always automated the data analysis part of my job, but never enough of it for my tastes. Although I am not a programmer by trade, I think like one. One of the creeds of a programmer is “don’t repeat yourself.” Sadly, at work, I repeat manual data analysis procedures all the time. Certain parts of my job resisted automation for years. Lots of work I do is ad-hoc and may never be repeated, so it rarely makes sense to automate it fully or to generalize the approach for other data files and projects. Other work I do, like pulling samples, happens all the time. I get fed up when I am performing it the same way, and no better than, how I did it years ago.</p>
<p>I put some though into it earlier this year and discovered that <em>documenting</em> the work, rather than performing it, was the biggest time-waster in my day. Documenting my work in work papers has always taken a very long time. While necessary, it is the least productive time I spend on an analysis project. (In audit, work papers are critical. They support our observations and can be followed, step-by-step, to reperform our work.)</p>
<p>This year, I finally figured out how to create a bot that would not only run a “standard analysis” on a certain type of dataset (that is the easy part for me), but would also document the work in an Excel work paper (that is the hard part). It is not perfect yet, but it has saved me a lot of time over the past six months. I plan to keep working on it, mostly by building new work paper templates and standard analyses, next year and into the future, so that it keeps payment me dividends.</p>

			 <p>Over the past year, my TrueNAS Core server has been bugging me every few months about one of my boot failing. In this case, the boot drives are simply two USB sticks, run in a mirrored configuration. If one fails, the other one handles the load. (The reason I use a USB stick for a boot drive is that my server has an internal USB port for that very purpose, and no other place for the boot drive to go.)</p>
<p>This week, after yet another USB stick failed, I tried to resolve the problem by buying new USB sticks and installing TrueNAS onto them. The OS installs took hours and the server would not reboot. Eventually I discovered that I could buy an SSD drive with the form factor of a USB stick, which is what I have wanted for years. It fits inside my server like a USB stick, but contains a fast, durable SSD drive instead of slow, fragile flash memory. I installed TrueNAS onto it, which seemed to take seconds rather than hours, but I could not boot from it. I spent an hour swapping USB drives and trying to boot the server until it would not boot TrueNAS from any USB drive I had. It was a disaster.</p>
<p>I gave up and installed Ubuntu Server onto the new SSD drive. I knew that Ubuntu supports ZFS now and could import my existing data pool. Luckily, it boots like a champ. After the install, I found some instructions to help me set up ZFS, Samba, and Minio, and—after editing file permissions—everything is set. I didn’t lose any data during the OS switch, but I did mess up my Arm backups when I tried to move them into a new Minio storage location. Luckily, I wasn’t depending on those backups for anything, because my important data is in the cloud and I have backups on Backblaze B2 as well.</p>
<p>I use the NAS daily for media sharing and backups. It takes very little maintenance except once in a while when it becomes a headache and money sink. I sometime wonder if I should go back to having an external hard drive instead, now that 8 TB external hard drives are pretty cheap. The problem with that approach is that external hard drives get hot and die, which happened to me so many times that I bought a NAS.</p>
<p>I will miss running TrueNAS (which used to be called FreeNAS) because I have run it for ten years and used to be really into its FreeBSD underpinnings. Now, all the servers I rely on run either Ubuntu Server or Debian, and I will just have to deal with administering them via SSH rather than via a web page.</p>

			 <p>I love <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/maybe-its-just-a-product-nobody-wants/">how Matt Birchler compares crypto to BitTorrent in his latest blog post</a>, “Maybe It&rsquo;s Just a Product Nobody Wants”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think crypto is going to disappear, by the way. I think it will always have a place in the world, but much like bittorrent before it, it was new &amp; exciting, people tried to use it for basically everything, and then it settled into being used for, well, nothing for most people. Blockchains likely have a more prominent future, but there&rsquo;s a lot of spaghetti being thrown at walls right now, and I think very little of it will stick because it&rsquo;s not actually making better products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m a crypto skeptic who thinks a lot about blockchain for work-related reasons. I dislike blockchain technologies because I think that, in the real world, they would fail to eliminate trusted intermediaries in financial transactions. Establishing trust without intermediaries is the whole point of blockchain.</p>
<p>I believe people and businesses are too risk-averse to do away with intermediaries like governments (who offer useful things like a legal system and deposit insurance) and the technology providers, agents, and brokers who make business work today. If crypto really takes off, and the old intermediaries are pushed out, I think that new intermediaries will pop up to fill in the gaps left behind. That future—blockchain <em>with</em> trusted intermediaries—is no better than what we have now, and is in many ways worse.</p>

It is a beautiful platformer that represents a metaphorical journey of a girl overcoming grief or depression. It is the kind of game that is meant to be an emotional experience rather than a challenge. In fact, it is impossible to lose. What struck me about it is how beautiful it is. The graphics are painterly and the music perfectly fits with the game’s themes and action.</p>

I think it is the weakest Marvel or Star Wars series that Disney+ has produced. The plotting is lazy and makes no sense, and at every turn it goes out of its way to undercut and ignore its title character, which is frustrating.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My main (or only) contribution to gift-giving for my kids this holiday season was a biggie: I bought them a multi-function color laser printer. (Don’t worry, my wife bought them a ton of other presents that are a lot more fun.)</p>
<p>I got the idea to buy a color printer because my son’s preschool prints everything in color, and the administrators there said that color printing is phenomenal for kids’ worksheets. Beyond filling out preschool worksheet, my son loves to take photos and to draw. Once he gets a newer iPad I’m sure he’ll draw more electronically and will love the ability to print out his creations in full color. My daughter will likely be printing out book covers. She likes to write and illustrate story books, and a color printer will allow her to do that with even more panache. She also makes lots of presentation slide decks for school, and I thought she might need to print them out to turn them in. It turns out that she submits everything to her teachers electronically, so that use case probably won’t pan out.</p>
<p>I didn’t intend to get a big, <em>multifunction</em> printer, though. I had wanted to buy a color printer, which was much cheaper. Due to the global supply shortage, I had to buy what was available, which meant ponying up for the next model up in the lineup, which includes a scanner, too. It cost a lot of money, and I’m well aware of how much toner and paper are going to cost me each year. I think will be worth it, though, to have a mini print-shop running in the family room from now on. My kids are both very excited to have it. I can’t wait to see what they do with it.</p>

			 <p>I had a couple dispiriting meetings toward the end of the week that killed the enthusiasm I had for what I have been working on over the past few months. First, one of my co-presenters said he thought that the lack of audience questions during our webinar indicated that everyone in the audience was just playing on their phones while we talked, waiting to collect their <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/careers/jobs/continuing-professional-education-cpe/">CPE</a> credits. Then, later in the week, one of the partners I report to on technology initiatives seemed unenthusiastic about the automation bot I created, which took basically all year to figure out how to do.</p>
<p>I have started to doubt myself again. I am wondering if the presentations I give and the white papers I write are too basic to be useful. Even worse, I am wondering again if my tech skills are not the best fit for my company.</p>
<p>Even outside of work I have felt my creativity drop. I have struggled to think up new ideas to write about or to muster the energy to work on my writing until the ideas start to flow again. I want to start coding a lot more again but have been too tired to get into it almost every night.</p>
<p>What I want is inspiration and energy. What I probably need is a diet, exercise, and more sleep.</p>

			 <p>Today, after almost two months of not having any usable time work on it, I finished coding the automation project that has been bedeviling me for half the year. I got over the technical hurdles months ago; all I needed was eight hours uninterrupted, so I could rewrite my code and test it. It took me a long, long time to find that time, but I found it today. It felt great to finally get it working, and even better to remove about half of the code as I optimized it. I am relieved that it is done. I will present it to one of our partners tomorrow, and plan to turn my attention to other things after that.</p>

			 <p>Today I made my final revision to the article I wrote for my company newsletter. It is an article about Big Data, which is a term that is both readily understandable and has no agreed-upon definition, which I intentionally did not bother to define in the opening paragraph. I was asked to define it anyway, right up front, and to cite it from a source. I did so and ended up with a real head-scratcher of a second sentence. I hated it so much that I ran it by my mentor. He confirmed that the definition I inserted was awful, and he sent me over a paragraph that helped me see a new way to open the essay. I ended up re-writing my first paragraph entirely, and came up with something that I am more proud of.</p>

<p>The article resembles an introduction to the (huge) white paper I am working on far more than a standalone article. This was my intent, but because of that, it lacks a proper ending.</p>

<p>I don’t know how to end it, and even if I did, I fear that it is longer than my company wants it to be (by a lot). The good news, if I could call it that, is that it is due on Monday. That means that it will be done when it has to be done, no matter what, because I don’t have a choice.</p>

			 <p>The oddest thing happened to me today. My neighbor texted me this morning saying that she heard a cat crying and thought it was stuck in my car, which was parked in my driveway. I went out to look—and looked pretty thoroughly—but saw and heard nothing of a cat. I thought my neighbor must have been mistaken.</p>
<p>An hour later my neighbor texted me again saying the cat was still in there, but stopped crying when I went outside to look. I went out again dutifully, looked again but far more quietly for the cat, and still found no trace of it.</p>
<p>An hour after that, my neighbor texted me again and said that the cat was crying louder and louder, and that she wanted to call animal control to get it out of my car. She asked me if that was OK with me, and I said yes. I went out a third time, and still did not observe in any way a cat in my car.</p>
<p>Finally, about 10 minutes after that, while I was in my house, I opened the window and then for the first time I heard a cat crying over and over and over again. I went out and heard the cat and the sound was coming from the engine block of my car. I still couldn’t see a cat though and did not know what to do.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a police officer and the animal control officer in my town came over and, after about half an hour of trying, were able to pluck out a tiny, tiny kitten that had m crawled beneath my car’s engine and lodged itself in there. Fortunately everything is all right with my car and nothing bad happened to the cat. They took it away in a cardboard box I gave them, and presumably brought it to a shelter.</p>

			 <p>After a week away from it, I finally sat down and wrote a little bit more of my article for my company’s newsletter. I still have about a week and half to complete it, and I am most of the way there.</p>
<p>My topic has drifted a bit from what I intended to write. I started with the intention of writing about how to execute a data call project. (A data call project is when a government organization asks private companies to send it data, which it then uses for analysis and reporting.) What I actually wrote so far is an introduction to how the insurance industry (which is the industry I worked in) extracts value from Big Data, and a call to action stating that insurance regulators should also leverage Big Data to help them regulate the industry. The whole thing will eventually serve as an introductory chapter to a much larger white paper (or is it a short book?) that I plan to complete over the course of next year.</p>
<p>It’s all very dry stuff, especially to those outside my field. It is important for me, though, to start writing down the things I know about at work. I think that getting published in industry journals, starting humbly with my own company’s periodic newsletter, will help me improve my profile in the industry, and is the best way for me to advance in my career and to make a difference. I know how to write clearly, which is a skill I have been undervaluing for many years. Now I plan to rely on that strength to move forward.</p>

			 <p>A real “rebuilding year” is when a sports team is broken down and reassembled, basically from scratch, after—and as a response to—a dreadful season. 2020 was a dreadful season for, well, everyone on earth due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It certainly was for me. I experienced some deep trauma back in 2018 when my father died, which I thought went away after a few months, but never really did. Watching my father die (of Alzheimers and old age) completely messed me up. The emerging pandemic in early 2020 let the lingering feelings I had from that time metastasize into full-blown depression and anxiety. Work and home life were both stressful to me all the time. My relationships with everybody suffered. I was a wreck. So was everyone else at the time, which blinded me to how much of a mess I was. At some point, my eyes slowly opened to what was really going on with me, mental-health wise. My problem was that once I realized that my brain wasn’t working right (as in, rationally), I could not trust any of my thoughts, even the ones that could lead me to getting better. It took me months to figure out how to get help, even though, in hindsight, it wasn’t really that hard. By the end of 2020, I was well on the way to recovering from my mental health problems, but I hadn’t rebuilt my life yet.</p>
<p>2021 has been a rebuilding year for me, pretty much from its first day. I made it a point to reach out to people. At work, I set up one-on-one meetings with everybody in my department, and asked for coaching sessions from people higher than me in the organization. At home, I made efforts to listen and to be more present in my relationships with my family members. Internally, I tried to be less hard on myself. I gave up some activities that were productive but stressful. I decided to write a blog entry every day. I allowed myself to waste time on mindless fun, like just listening to music or playing video games, after the kids were in bed (or supposed to be in bed, at least). I had thought that I would get the COVID vaccine and society would get back to normal. Of course, that hasn’t quite happened yet, but I am optimistic that next year will be the time when masking and social distancing pretty much go away. (I’m aware that a lot of people don’t wear masks when they go out, but my wife and kids wear masks at school for hours and hours each day, so masking and social distancing are very much going strong for my family.)</p>
<p>Over the course of this rebuilding year, I have re-learned what I love to do, which I had forgotten over the past few years: Break complex things down to make them understandable; ask big, deep (or maybe dumb) questions; and to communicate ideas, especially in writing.</p>
<p>I am both doing less than I used to and doing more. I am programming less and writing more. I made it a point to improve my presentation skills, and I did that. I taught myself how to make better slides, even though it was very challenging at first, and how to rehearse and revise a talk until it is brisk and concise. I have given …five or more presentations at work this year, on department-level and company-level Webex calls. I created a slide deck for our managing partner to present to the board of directors. I am getting more well known for my technical skills and presentation skills at work, too, which makes me feel great about my job for the first time in years. I also made it a point to write an article for my company’s newsletter, and I am about 85% done with that now, and plan to wrap it up next week. Lastly, I learned to type in the Colemak-DH layout on an unusual, ortholinear keyboard (still really slowly, I admit), and that proved to me that my brain was flexible enough to do it. I am literally rewiring my brain.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, I will not be rebuilt, but will keep rebuilding. That is the most important thing I learned this year.</p>

			 <p>My wife teaches a public speaking course, and from time to time we talk about what examples of public speaking would be good for her students to watch. While we go through the usual speeches by luminaries such as President Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and also pick apart the speeches of politicians of our day, I always argue that, if you want to learn public speaking, you could do a lot worse than viewing and analyzing Steve Jobs’s many famous product launches. So much has been made of Steve Jobs’s keynotes that there is a Wikipedia page dedicated to them: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevenote">Stevenote</a>. He was a mesmerizing presenter.</p>
<p>I still think about how he unveiled the iPhone, which everyone in the audience at the time expected and knew would be a cell phone, but had no idea would be, well, the iPhone. He knew what the audience expected, and faked them out through the first half of his presentation about it. He said “Today, we’re introducing <em>three</em> revolutionary products” which upended the audience’s expectations. He repeated what those devices were—“An iPod, a Phone, and an Internet communicator”—as icons for those three things spun around on the big screen behind him, until the audience was laughing. Then he said, “are you getting it?” and people cheered as they realized that he was talking about a single product.</p>
<p>The thing that is amazing, re-watching the presentation, is that it is full of jokes, like the image of an iPod with a telephone rotary dial instead of a click wheel. It’s also amazing how Steve Jobs was able to sound so natural, even though he never ad-libs and never flubs a word. He extremely well rehearsed, and he made what he did look easy.</p>
<p>I like to think that he was genuinely excited about what he presented, and that is a key factor I have tried to bring to my own presentations. I’m not able to present anything as fascinating as the iPhone to my peers, but I have the creative freedom to come up with my own ideas when I made a presentation, and I can certainly be excited about them. The way I see it is that I present <em>ideas</em>, not just facts. Ideas are propulsive in ways that facts are not. Connecting ideas together <em>is</em> exciting—at least if done in such a way that you can keep the audience interested. Humor and surprise are effective tools to do so, as Steve Jobs so often demonstrated.</p>

Although its resolution is indeed very low, it still offers every bit of the charm of the recent Shantae games, along with satisfying gameplay, great music, and fun character designs.

			 <p>Two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Culture</strong>. The Puritan work ethic is one of the foundations of our culture, and has been since colonial times. Work is righteous and cleansing to the soul. Of course this is nonsensical, but it is baked into the culture. People are brought up hearing that our ancestors pulled themselves up by their bootstraps (itself a nonsensical idea if you think about it), and that when times get tough we should do the same rather than reach out to others for assistance. This idea can be termed rugged individualism.</li>
<li><strong>Economic uncertainty</strong>. The US have a poor social safety net, and about half of all voters consistently vote to strip more and more of it away. I have it pretty good, economically speaking, but I feel like I am only a few months away from losing my house if my wife or I lose our jobs and can’t replace it incomes and our health insurance right away. Also, income inequality is such that there is always someone vastly richer than you to compare yourself to. That drives a lot of people to work harder, even though a lot of the very rich inherited their wealth (seed money at least) and/or the connections needed to grow it.</li>

			 <p>I have a corner desk that is connected to a second, straight desk, which looks really cool, but is a pain (literally) to use. While it offers me enough space for two desktop computer setups: a necessarily sloppy-looking windows laptop-and-monitor setup for work, and a more streamlined Mac mini-and-monitor setup for home, it causes a lot of problems. The desktop is so high that it puts pressure on my forearms when I use the keyboard, which leads to wrist pain. The desktop on the Mac side is not level and there is no way to adjust it, so the monitor is always tilted slightly, which drives me crazy. The desk drawer and keyboard tray are too low and bang into the top of my legs. Lastly, the keyboard tray, when open, blocks the desk draw, which is super annoying.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to it than just the desk setup. There are low cabinets and high bookshelves stretching across two walls of my office, all connected into a big L. You can see that it is made up of many different components, but they are all stuck together with no space between the seams. For the past eleven years I thought it was glued together by the house’s prior owners, but my father-in-law pointed out to me tonight that I was mistaken. The furniture is screwed together; it was designed to attach. Therefore, it will be a straightforward (though physically demanding) process to separate it and get it out of my house. I could even keep the bookcases and low cabinets that aren’t bothering me especially, to make room for a new, completely separate desk.</p>
<p>I am relieved to know that something can be done that falls short of hiring a demolition crew to break all this stuff apart and haul it away. I can get rid of the desk portions <em>only</em>, which I didn’t know was possible. That would leave me with 68 inches of space for a new desk. It will be more difficult to figure out how to accommodate both my Mac and PC setups, with all the USB peripherals and so on, but that is a problem that technology and money can probably solve.</p>

			 <p>In college, one of my humanities professors, Prof. Klein, told me that genius is being able to look at the same things everybody else does but see something different. She told me a story to illustrate:</p>
<p>One time she had company at her house—a friend and her kids—and they needed to find a place for three little kids to sleep for the night. There was only one bed, but it was a queen-sized bed, which she thought would only suit up to two people. The friend, however, knew right away that it would work. The friend realized that, because kids are short and small, they could be fit onto the bed, just not in the normal, expected way. The friend put three pillows on one side of the bed, arranged down the long way. Then she adjusted the sheet and blanket so they opened up on the side of the bed where she had put the pillows. Then the three kids slept in that bed, arranged sideways, and had plenty of room.</p>
<p>I always appreciated the simplicity of this story.</p>

			 <p>One fun thing I did with my daughter tonight is to compare the slide decks we are developing. I’m working on an InsurTech presentation for work, and she created a Civil Rights &amp; Women’s Suffrage presentation for school. I think it’s fun for her to see that we are doing a similar thing.</p>
<p>Tonight I walked her through the concept of a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-build-slide-1776b892-4967-444c-bcaf-d4fbd0953b79">build slide</a> using one I created for my talk next week. On a build slide, the content pops in one element at a time, which allows you to step the audience through a step-by-step process without overwhelming them by showing all the steps up front. (If overused or distractingly animated, build slides are annoying. Judiciously used, they can be very effective.)</p>
<p>I also showed my daughter how I use different and varied visual layouts to make my slides visually appealing. I showed her that good slides tend to have only a few things on them—six or fewer, usually. I tried to explain how to incorporate icons with text, but my business-y examples of icons meant nothing to her, so I don’t think she grasped it.</p>
<p>She was most impressed to see that I write a lot of text in the speaker notes section, which is displayed below the slides. She said that they didn’t teach her to write speaker notes in school, which surprised me a little, because she is giving live presentations, not just turning in completed slide decks.</p>
<p>I use speaker notes extensively because I prefer to script my talks and revise the scripts as I rehearse them out loud. That process helps me cover my points in as few words as possible. It also helps me fit the words to my mouth, which is how I describe editing my text to sound more natural when I say it.</p>
<p>By the time I’m done, I have practically memorized the script, so I do not have to read it, and it feels very natural to say what I have prepared. That method requires writing skills that are beyond the fourth grade level, I’m afraid, but hopefully my daughter will be ready to learn how I do it someday.</p>

			 <p>My wife and I started watching <em>The Americans</em> this weekend. We stumbled upon it when browsing Amazon Prime Video. It’s good to have something to watch on Prime Video, because it is criminally underutilized in my house. The last thing I watched on it was <em>Invincible</em> and I don’t even remember how long ago that was.</p>

			 <p>Looking back on last week, I played a lot of video games. A <em>lot</em> more than usual actually. It’s a sort of thing I do when my brain is so tired I can’t do anything else, not even focus on a TV show. I have been working really hard writing system walkthroughs or performing data analysis during the day, and working on a presentation and an article for publication in my company’s newsletter during the evenings. I realized that I have been staving off mental exhaustion by escaping into the world of Pokémon or Metroid in the late night hours before I go to bed. This might keep happening for the next few weeks. It is an absolute sprint for me until December 3, I’m afraid. At least at the end of the year we get the last week off.</p>

			 <p>If, after enjoying double-digit leads in Monmouth University and Fairleigh Dickinson polls last week, Murphy loses the New Jersey gubernatorial race (which seems pretty likely right now), the pollsters deserve to be roundly criticized, once again, for relying on unrepresentative sampling or making incorrect assumptions in their production modeling. Campaigns rely on these polls to gauge the impact of their efforts, and voters see large leads in the polls as an excuse to stay home, as their votes are not needed for their candidate to win.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Barbara Sprunt reports for <em>NPR</em> today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sen. Joe Manchin has announced he cannot yet support the $1.75 trillion framework for President Biden&rsquo;s social spending package that congressional Democrats were hoping to push through this week.</p>
<p>“I will not support a bill that is this consequential without thoroughly understanding the impact that it will have on our national debt, our economy and, most importantly, all of our American people,&quot; the West Virginia Democrat said in a statement Monday afternoon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel like she could have written this article any day this year, since Joe Biden was inaugurated. Sen. Joe Manchin is destined to be the Joe Lieberman of 2021. Like Lieberman, who killed the ACA’s “public option” to protect his insurance company donors in Connecticut, Manchin will be responsible for neutering the most impactful legislation since the ACA, all because of a price tag that is (1) going to be spread out over a decade; (2) will represent a tiny percentage of GDP over that period; and (3) has been cut in half since this spring. Point 1 is just the standard Republican talking points about any kind of spending that isn’t a tax cut.</p>
<p>This rigamarole has gone so long that I don’t think the Democrats can reach him with any kind of progressive legislation. It is dangerous to anger him too much over this, too, because he could flip parties, and then the Democrats would lose the Senate. Overall, he is an untrustworthy person to negotiate with. As for the similarly “centrist” Kyrsten Sinema, she is at a whole other level of incomprehensibility, and could still be a spoiler to the Democrats even if Manchin eventually agrees to some bill. Neither one of them are fighting for anything of value for their constituents. I would be surprised if they remain in office after their next elections, no matter what they do from this point forward. It’s hyperbole, of course, but I want to say: “Never has so much been lost for so little gain.”</p>

			 <p>In America, we could all unite politically, but only if we all decided to be Republicans. That is what happened, briefly, after 9/11. It could never have gone the other way; there is no way we could all put down our differences and become Democrats for a while. That is by design. For as long as I have been alive, Republicans have defined what Democrats are. To them, Democrats are many horrible things, but they are primarily unpatriotic, ineffectual, and toxic. (To be honest, there are also racist and homophobic stereotypes thrown in, too.) Many Republicans would gladly vote for a dog over a Democrat, mainly because right-wing messaging has tarnished the party label completely and relentlessly in a large portion of the country for decades.</p>
<p>I have been a Democrat all my life. Even I find it incredibly hard to define what a Democrat is without relying on terms and caricatures invented my Republicans. I don’t think most people understand that they have the same blind spot. I see it all the time in news articles, opinion essays, blog posts and tweets. I see most people using the language of Republicans defining what Democrats are. I see some people who are disheartened with Republican politicians or policies refuse on principle to see Democrats as sensible alternatives. I want to say to those authors: You don’t really know what a Democrat is because it has been defined by the opposing party for its own benefit.</p>
<p>I think Democrats—even most Democratic politicians—believe in their own bad press, too, because it has been so pervasive over my lifetime that it is part of American culture and ideology. I want to say to these people: You are not how others perceive you; you are what you do.</p>

			 <p>One thing I certainly do not believe in is the divine right of kings. When considering why this is, I originally thought it was because I am American, and come from a country whose founders rejected the monarchy. But that can’t be it. Americans <em>love</em> monarchies, especially the British one. I realized that my feelings about it go deeper, and distract from my enjoyment of the fairy tale movies and stories my kids consume, which very frequently include princes and princesses whose right to wealth and power is never questioned.</p>
<p>People can accrue power in various ways: being strong, wise, skillful, or charismatic are just a few. However, I think that there is limit to how much power these positive traits would give a person. They could lead a clan, but not a kingdom. To exert power over a kingdom requires ruthlessness, egoism, and violence.</p>
<p>I believe that, at the dawn of history and before, ancient kings and pharaohs accrued their power over others through conquest. They didn’t earn their land. They took it. They didn’t earn their wealth. They stole it. They didn’t earn the subservience of their followers. They forced it.</p>
<p>This line of thought leads me to believe that all modern nations could trace themselves back to powerful people who stole their wealth from others. Furthermore, they used their power to invent religions and rules of thumb—such as hereditary monarchy and the divine right of kings—to justify and perpetuate their position at the top of society.</p>
<p>To this day, these ideas still have appeal and currency. We don’t question them, even those of us who live in democratic republics. To believe someone is a prince, you have to believe in princes.</p>
<p>I don’t believe in princes anymore. Nor kings, nor queens, nor princesses. These are just people who, by chance of birth, benefitted from ancient theft and conquest, and perpetuate the myth that they deserve it.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/10/25/sex-education-but.html">Sex education, but not the TV show this time</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The latest controversy in my area is another type of fight between conservative parent activist groups and school boards. This time it is not about mask requirements, but about sex education. Two things specifically rile the shouting class this time: (1) Masturbation exists, and (2) so do LGBTQ+ people.</p>
<p>Apparently, there are enough prudes out there to give the school superintendents hell about teaching about masturbation in schools (grade 3-5 specifically, in my case). I’m not talking about teaching <em>how</em> to masturbate, or about teaching that masturbation is a <em>normal</em>, natural thing for people to do, or even teaching that mutual masturbation can be an alternative to sexual intercourse that is <em>far</em> less likely to lead to pregnancy. I’m talking about even saying the word masturbation or writing it down.</p>
<p>The elementary school superintendent emailed everybody in town to clarify that masturbation is not included in my town’s 3rd-to-5th grade sex-ed at all, and proved it by excerpting parts of the curriculum. So all the bother over it, in my town at least, was just noise created by busybodies and crackpots. It is embarrassing to me that sex-ed can’t cover the one thing that the kids, by fifth grade, are probably already doing, and at least tell them it is OK. Instead, they will learn—from each other mostly—to feel ashamed about it.</p>
<p>LBGTQ+ material is <em>also</em> not part of the curriculum, which is terrible. LGBTQ+ people <em>exist</em>, which is not contingent on whether certain parents or people don’t like it or approve of it. Some of the students in every school are LGBTQ+, and they deserve to learn that they are not alone, not weird, have resources available to them if they need them, and deserve to be treated with respect. There was so much homophobia when I came of age (the late 1980s) that, if I had thought I was gay, it would have been devestating to me. And, at the time, I thought of myself as very progressive about homosexuality—I figured out myself that homosexuals must be born that way. If I came of age and discovered that I was gay, bi, or whatever, I would have needed some support from grown-ups and authority figures, and probably would have had no better place to get it than from school.</p>
<p>I would agree that grade 3 is too early to broach these topic and that grade 4 <em>may</em> be too early for most kids. However, grade 5 is the <em>latest</em> that these topics should be introduced, because that is when most of the kids will need help understanding them. Sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity are all things that teens and adults have to deal with all the time. To sweep some of it under the rug because prudish or religious people think they are improper just underserves our kids and perpetuates the persecution of non-cis, non-straight people.</p>
<p>You could argue that sex education should be handled at home, by parents, and that schools should keep out of it, or only focus on its biological aspects. That may sound reasonable, but it really isn’t. While I agree that parents <em>should</em> educate their children about sex—like my wife and I will—to arm them with information and to help them through puberty without developing unnecessary shame or body horror. The thing is, a lot of parents <em>don’t</em>—and those are the ones who are most vocal right now. We should not let them dictate how much or how little will be taught to all of our kids about the facts of life.</p>

I did not do so before because I had thought it would be better to take my kids to the polls to show how voting works. I realized that I can also do that from home. Really, we should all be voting by mail. It would expand the franchise, and give us more time to consider the down-ballot candidates, like school board members, who are not covered by the media and can have a direct affect on our lives in ways that governors and presidents cannot.</p>

<p>I think my current presentations slides and speaker notes are much better, and that the talk will be have better focus and clarity, but I am surprised at how much I want to say seems to be recycled from what I already had thought about the topic.</p>

			 <p>I was very excited early this month for the release of <em>Metroid Dread</em> so I watched a bunch of videos on YouTube of gamers playing through classic Metroid games. Eventually the YouTube algorithm led me to learn about retro handheld devices. These are emulators that can play games from many older systems. I quickly got obsessed with them and ordered one, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tSiYJof3dw">an Anbernic RG351MP</a>, despite my history of not really liking many of the classic games available on my Nintendo Switch. So, it may be a waste of money, or something I can eventually give to one of my kids, or it will be something I really love. I am looking forward to setting it up, tweaking its firmware, and playing some classic games.</p>

			 <p>I learned about something new today from three separate podcasts I listened to, and a New York Times article I stumbled upon: popularism. It’s an idea that David Shor wrote about that apparently boils down to this: To win voters, Democrats should talk about what is popular rather than focus on racial tensions, identity politics, and calls to dramatically alter government and social systems (“defund the police,” for example, would be out).</p>
<p>What I wondered about this idea is this: Who determines what is popular? What if what is popular is not good? Plenty of popular ideas are amoral and destructive. Isn’t having principles, and now bowing to public pressure, valued in American politics, too? Or is that just posturing?</p>

I presented on InsurTech several times before, dating all the way back to 2017. This time is different, however, because I have leveled up my presentation skills. I am excited to get the chance to present again, and am embracing the opportunity to find something new to say about technology, insurance, and investments.</p>
<p>This year I have been presenting so much more than I ever have before. One reason, I think, is that we are not doing training in person due to the pandemic. I hope we keep doing webinars; they could be one of my specialities going forward.</p>

			 <p>A few weeks ago, prompted by a flare-up or RSI pain in my wrists and forearms, I moved my keyboard and trackball from my desk (which is a corner desk that is apparently too high for me) to a siding drawer beneath my desktop. Now I have to sit almost a foot further away from where the monitor was, which necessitated moving my monitor forward almost to the edge of my desk. Overall, the change has been beneficial to my RSI (I stopped using a wrist rest for the first time ever), but it ruined everything else.</p>
<p>Now I have no room on my desk for my stuff, can no longer reach my speakers or headphone amp well enough to use them, and, because my trackball is taller than the depth of the keyboard drawer, I can’t close my keyboard drawer. The always-open keyboard drawer interferes with my main desk drawer where I keep my headphone cables. I stopped listening to music at my desk, which brings me joy, anymore because the setup is unworkable. Also, my desktop is a mess now because the monitor is in a stupid place, and I have no place for my iPad, my computer headset, or anything else.</p>
<p>I need a new and different setup, but that is almost impossible for me to get right now. All my current home office furniture came with my house, is <em>glued</em> together, and takes up two entire walls of the room, so it will take some heavy lifting, literally and financially, to make any changes.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My wife and I have been watching <em>Sex Education</em> season three. True to its title, the show actually does weave sex education into its stories and strives to impart sensible information to its audience.</p>
<p>In one of the episodes, a trans student acts completely confused about which of the two sex–specific (boys and girls) sex education classes that the school’s new, conservative principal set up that they should attend. Because the trans character is new to the show, this scene seemed like a zeitgeisty political statement that the show’s writers crammed in, rather than a story beat that grew organically out of the characters and themes of the show.</p>
<p>In this scene, I thought that the trans character was being obtuse. After all, gender isn’t sex. Bodily organs are not identities. I would imagine a transgender person would understand that better than I would. I thought that the character should just go to one class or the other without making a political statement about it. I’m sure the character could just blow off the class without coming to any harm.</p>
<p>My wife and I discussed this scene after the episode was over. I was annoyed by the scene’s apparent politicism, but came to a conclusion about it that probably aligns with the trans character’s thoughts: Segregated boy/girl sex-ed is pointlessly gendered. Bodies have sexual organs, both external and internal. It would be good to know how they work, whichever ones you have. In fact, because of this, it makes sense to teach everybody, all together, how everybody’s sexual organs work and how reproduction works, too (pregnancy, childbirth, the whole thing). Perhaps that isn’t done because kids are too immature to handle it. I bet, though, that it isn’t done because adults are too embarrassed to do it.</p>

			 <p>One of the more memorable books I read in college was assigned to me in comparative literature class: Erasmus’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Praise_of_Folly"><em>In Praise of Folly</em></a>. It is an exploration of human folly, written during the Renaissance by Erasmus, who was a philosopher and theologian, as an elaborate inside joke for his friend, Sir Thomas More. Folly is personified as a particularly vain goddess who praises herself (which is itself folly) for all of the great joys and accidental discoveries that folly brings to our lives.</p>
<p>It was memorable to me because, while folly is ubiquitous, it was something that was almost never well explored in my English-major coursework. (It was discussed in my Shakespeare courses when it came to Bottom and Fallstaff, but that is about it.) Little did I know when I was a twenty-year-old college student that understanding and appreciating that I, too, would be capable or folly, succumb to folly, and see folly in others on a daily basis. Life experience, far more than schooling, has taught me that folly is inevitable and inescapable in life, for both good and for ill. As Erasmus’s essay cheekily suggests, if folly is inevitable, you might as well find something to enjoy in it.</p>
<p>My folly, as a very young adult reading Erasmus for the first time, was thinking that adult life, which I was heading into apace, was going to make sense once I got there.</p>

<p>In anticipation for the new game, over the past few weeks, I played through about most of <em>Metroid</em> and <em>Super Metroid</em> to get back into playing shape for it. The first game is pretty rough, but <em>Super Metroid</em> is a masterpiece. I played through it on a 3-day rental when I was a teenager, and always remembered how great it was. I also dug up my old <em>Metroid Fusion</em> cartridge. I own it but don’t don&rsquo;t think that my hands are up for playing it anymore on my old Game Boy Advance.</p>

			 <p>One of my favorite subreddit names is “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aboringdystopia/">a boring dystopia</a>”. It is certainly not one of my favorite subreddits to browse—it is too depressing for that honor—but its name perfectly catches the zeitgeist. So many bad things happening right now are so dreadfully mundane that we don’t even want to think about them.</p>
<p>￼One aspect of our boring dystopia lately has been the failure of global supply chains to keep up with demand. Derek Thompson <a href="https://apple.news/ASd7iJLAjQJWv0ZCdGhECqQ">wrote about this in <em>The Atlantic</em> this week</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. economy isn’t yet experiencing a downturn akin to the 1970s period of stagflation. This is something different, and quite strange. Americans are settling into a new phase of the pandemic economy, in which GDP is growing but we’re also suffering from a dearth of a shocking array of things—test kits, car parts, semiconductors, ships, shipping containers, workers. This is the Everything Shortage.</p>
<p>The Everything Shortage is not the result of one big bottleneck in, say, Vietnamese factories or the American trucking industry. We are running low on supplies of all kinds due to a veritable hydra of bottlenecks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a shortage in the labor market, resource shortages, shipping problems, and all other sorts of problems due to the COVID pandemic and to climate change. It seems as if all the just-in-time logistics I learned in business school stopped working all at once. People still want to buy things, which is a silver lining economically speaking, but we are all having trouble getting a bunch of different things. The global supply system is no longer working.</p>
<p>I can’t get certain products for my family on a daily basis. I am thankful I don’t need a car or a refrigerator because the wait times in them are very long right now. It is yet another terribly boring way that it feels absolutely insane to be alive today. Due to climate change, I think supply line shortages and delays are going to get worse before they get better.</p>

			 <p>After hours of struggle last night on an automation project I am doing for work, I had a breakthrough today. I feel good about the project for the first tome in months.</p>
<p>In my experience, robotic process automation (RPA) cannot be coded in the same way as, say, VBA to manipulate data. I am very good at coding in VBA, even though it is my least favorite programming language. VBA was built for traditional programmers like me. I am used to using code to manipulate data, which is how VBA works. I am not used to using programming (not even code, but commands) to manipulate the user interface <em>around</em> the data, which is the most important part of how RPA works.</p>
<p>Automating applications and websites to work on data is tricky for numerous reasons. First, unpredictable things happen at runtime, like error messages for the application or the operating system that pop up and interrupt the program flow. Websites change unpredictably, and what you expect to be there suddenly is gone. In addition, if one step in an automation does not work right, and that is not handled appropriately, the automation will just barrel on and do goodness knows what in the wrong place or in the wrong window or application. Lastly, every action takes an unpredictable amount of time to finish, for a myriad of different reasons. It is hard to predict all of the weird things that might happen at runtime, but you have to deal with them as best you can.</p>
<p>The one thing that has been especially bedeviling to me is that, when an automation (or, colloquially, a <em>bot</em>) runs, the amount of time any task within it takes is completely unpredictable. If the bot does not wait long enough after something finishes, what it needs for the next task (typically a window, menu, or other control) may not even exist yet. The bot I am building would run one day, and fail to finish the next day, solely because my computer ran more slowly sometimes.</p>
<p>I found that my bot started working consistently only after I stopped trying to wait a fixed number of seconds between tasks, but instead told it, every step of the way, to wait until the control it needs to interact with next exists on screen. This leads to a lot more steps that I have to add to the automation, but also to a lot less guesswork about how long a pause is necessary between actions.</p>
<p>I also figured out a better way to wait for long-running data tasks and macros in Excel to finish. It’s simple, but I did not know it was possible until I looked for it today: wait for the mouse cursor to change from the hourglass cursor back to a normal one. It’s just what you would do as a user, but my programmer mindset, always focused on the data rather than on the user interface around the data, made me blind to it for a long time.</p>
<p>With these few changes to my coding approach, my confidence, which admittedly had been shaken by the project, has grown. I now feel that a lot more is possible to build with RPA technology. It just will be more tedious to build it than I would like it to be.</p>

			 <p>This morning, I just had to click on a news story about somebody’s kid who tragically died of COVID. This evening I just had to listen to a podcast about the Supreme Court’s capricious behavior and what lies ahead in its term. These things didn’t teach me anything, or give me any insights I didn’t already had. Instead they leached me of energy.</p>
<p>Now, when I read an article or listen to a podcast that I know, going in will make me upset, or sad, or depressed, and inevitably <em>does</em> make me upset, or sad, or depressed, I find myself asking myself, automatically, “Why did I let that <em>in</em>?” The emphasis in my internal self-admonishment has recently moved from <em>that</em> to <em>in</em>, and I don’t really know why. I suppose that I have conceded to myself that I cannot avoid the daily torrent of news, gossip, hot takes, and both-sides-isms that pervades the internet. Even if I did avoid them myself, my family members bring them to me eventually, because we are all tapped into it. The trick I want to learn is to be able to observe all the frightful noise of each day’s media storm, but not dwell on it and let it bother me. Whether it bounces off me or passes through me, I don’t want to let it in anymore.</p>

			 <p>My daughter learned about slavery and the Civil War today in school. We talked about both—mostly slavery—over dinner. Needless to say, it was a heavy conversation—the first of many about race, racism, and the cracks in the foundation of our country. My daughter was, rightly, very shaken up about what we told her.</p>
<p>It made me think of when I first learned about slavery in detail, when I was in high school. I had two American history teachers who covered slavery. One taught us that slavery was wrong, but also taught us that slaves were <em>not</em> beaten and tortured like popular culture had taught us, because—and this is <em>gross</em>—slaves were expensive and slaveowners wouldn’t want to destroy their investment in them. He would have us believe that most slaves were treated fairly well for economic reasons. I don’t think my teacher was a racist, but he drank the racist Kool-Aid: The Lost Cause apologists’ dismissal, “Sure, slavery was bad, but that was in the past. We fixed it. It wasn’t even that bad if you really think about it. Anyway, it’s over now. We don’t have to feel bad about it anymore.”</p>
<p>I remember discussing slavery in his class in the context of moral relativism. (Moral realism was a huge school of thought in the nineties.) We debated how to judge people, like the Founding Fathers, who expressed high ideals about the dignity of humanity while, at the same time, they owned slaves. Is it fair to judge historical figures by today’s standards? These are important discussions to have in a history class. Back then I wanted to believe that these historical figures should be judged only by the standards of their time, both because I wanted them to remain my heroes, and because it seemed unfair to hold them to a standard that they might not have been even aware of.</p>
<p>My other American history teacher stated to the class that slavery is morally wrong, across all time and across all cultures. He minced no words about it: there is no moral relativism when it came to slavery. It’s always wrong to subjugate others. Some things are simply <em>verboten</em>; it doesn’t matter what the society accepts or believes, or what the reasons are behind it. Even if we believe that most slaves were not subjected to frequent physical violence, as the other history teacher claimed, and even if we somehow believe slaver were treated very well, it does not forgive their subjugation, for that is psychological torture and is simply wrong. It doesn’t matter even if society deems such a thing acceptable; people should know innately that certain things are wrong.</p>
<p>His simple lesson was the one that stuck with me. It has colored my thoughts about justice ever since. Moral relativism has certain clear limits. From him I learned that we could judge historical figures by their standards <em>and</em> our own. We don’t have to choose, and it doesn’t even make sense to choose. There are people who created my country who did great and terrible things. To understand them, you have to scrutinize them fully as humans, warts and all.</p>
<p>My parents never talked cogently to me about race when I was growing up. I picked up what they, and everyone else, thought about race slowly and organically. It didn’t help that I grew up in a preponderously white and Catholic area of Connecticut. We, as a region, had some kind of race panic over school desegregation (<a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/sheff-v-oneill">Scheff v. O’Niell</a>) while I was in high school. I thought then that people’s concern was mostly about differences in <em>class</em> between the cities and the suburbs. Now I know I was naive. White people didn’t want their kids to mix with black kids, just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_desegregation_busing_crisis">in Boston</a>. I remember everybody being angry about the issue, but nothing ever happened that affected me or my town’s schools, as far as I know.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I was an adult that I lived and worked in multi-racial settings. I learned a lot about how similar we all are.</p>

			 <p>Today I listened to <a href="https://youtu.be/24F6C1KfbjM">a lecture that Stephen Fry gave to Nokia Bell Labs a few years ago</a>. He told stories about Pandora’s Box, about the invention of chess, about how doubling grains of rice on each square of a chessboard will eventually lead to counts of rice grains larger than the number of atoms in the known universe, about the founding of Intel, and so on. Stephen Fry’s stories were old, familiar, and, many of them, not literally true—but he connected them together to his ideas about technology and its effect on humanity in ways that were central to his thesis. The overall effect was very compelling to me.</p>
<p>One of the greatest things in life is to hear or read a good story, well told. When a storyteller tells <em>multiple</em> stories, makes connections between them, and links them to new stories and new ideas in an entirely new context, then something new and extraordinary can result from it: One can share new ideas, new ways of thinking, and easier ways for people to remember these ideas and ways of thinking. The stories can be fun and memorable. The connections between them can be intellectually or emotionally exciting.</p>
<p>There are far fewer good stories in the world than ways to tell them. Rather than worry about retelling a familiar tale, find an effective way to tell it, and mine it for ideas and themes that can connect to the story that you want to tell, or to the topic you want to speak about. Narratives are important because they are entertaining and memorable. Facts, when contextualized by being included in or linked to a narrative, are far more memorable than dry recitations of data. Connections between different stories and ideas are the most valuable thing you can communicate, because they are the hardest to come up with, and not everybody makes them on their own. The power of connection is to recontextualize something—or everything—in the audience’s mind.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One reason I decided to publish something (even something short, as long as it is creative) to a blog every day was to help me get over the perfectionism that has limited my creative output so much over the years.</p>
<p>I don’t publish because my writing or even my thoughts are “done”. I publish because it is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. That’s what I <em>do</em>. I do this every day.</p>
<p>I write for myself. I am gladdened that a few people on Micro.blog read what I write sometimes. I don’t expect it. It is a bonus. I don’t have an agenda, and therefore am not seeking out an audience. However, if I didn’t publish my little essays as blog posts, they would always be drafts, and would never be done.</p>
<p>Moreover, they wouldn’t be <em>out there</em> on the vast internet for some curious person to discover someday. My words, mundane as they may be sometimes, might help somebody out of a tough emotional spot, or get them to understand something a little bit better. They are my small, insignificant gifts to the world. I don’t care if the world accepts them or not; it’s what I have to give.</p>
<p>This blog post is probably not my best one. I’m not the first person to think that writing every day, with the necessary element of publishing it, is a worthwhile and rewarding exercise for the mind. I’m sure that, if I searched the web, one could find hundreds or thousands more posts just like it. That does not diminish its value to me. This is <em>my</em> blog post. These are my immediate thoughts—today. And if I have not expressed them perfectly, well, tomorrow is another chance to do so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I am four years old, sitting atop a hay bale in front of a farm stand with my kindergarten class, drinking apple cider and eating a white powdered donut.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can still taste the apple cider—sharp, sweet, with a distinctive bite because, as I would later figure out, it was turning hard. I can still see the bright white of the sugar on the donut and smell the hay that scratched my skin when I kicked my legs over the side of the bale. These foods, and the whole experience, were new to me. Every bit of it was surprising and delightful.</p>
<p>To this day, the taste of that cider is especially vivid in my mind. Nothing I have tasted since has ever matched that first sip of cider.</p>

			 <p>I have two collections that I love but cannot justify: high-end headphones (each is sub-$500, but still really expensive and good) and mechanical keyboards (each is $240 or less). It took ten years to build up these collections, so the embarrassing amount of money I have spent is spread out over a long, long period. I was wondering today if people who spend a lot more than I do on vacations do so because they forego (and don’t care about) material objects like pricy headphones and keyboards.</p>
<p>Getting into these “hobbies” (if buying stuff can be called a hobby) was entirely accidental. I’m part of a product review program where I can occasionally select products I like for no money up front, and then only pay taxes on their value months later. I got my first taste of better headphones and better keyboards through that program, essentially through the luck of the draw. (I’m not in charge of which products become available for me to review.) If not for that, I probably would have no other headphones other than my AirPods, and would probably have a $100 Microsoft or Logitech keyboard that I would have to replace (because of wear) every year or two.</p>
<p>I think I am finally nearing “endgame” in both of these categories. I have fantastic headphones of nearly every type (dynamic and planar magnetic, open-back and closed-back, Bluetooth and wired), and they cover every situation, that I need. Similarly, I have mechanical keyboards for all of my computers, have tried a bunch of different key switches (clicky, tactile, and linear), and have even bought a “weird” ortholinear board that I never thought I would ever want until a couple months ago. Any new keyboard purchases are going to be about fixing something that is broken (my wonderful and unacceptably buggy Durgod tenkeyless) or trying out a different type of keyswitch on my new, hot-swappable ortholinear board. At least I hope that will be the case. Collecting more and more of these objects sometimes feels like an obsession, and is not something I want to keep doing forever.</p>

			 <p>I have worked from home for more than half of my career. I’m no stranger to working in an office, but I find myself wondering what people actually do at work all day. I always imagine that my coworkers are more focused on their tasks than I am, or more driven to earn a promotion, or more highly structured in their approach to managing their work than I am.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure, though, that that <em>can’t</em> be, because no one I have ever worked with in person was much more focused that I was, with the exception of one or two workaholic bosses I’ve had. <em>Those</em> guys loved their job in ways I couldn’t replicate—at least that’s what I thought—and that drove them to work well into the evenings every day, after I was ready to go home.</p>
<p>My last office-job experience was mostly great, but there was a lot of gossip, walking around, waiting for elevators, waiting for meetings to begin, going out to grab a coffee, and so on. Half of my day was spent on actual work, even though I spent almost the entire day with my team, doing the same things they were doing. When I worked from home on that job, I got a lot more done, even though I would take break to make my coffee or put a load of laundry in the washing machine.</p>
<p>My job today is different than any of the office-based ones. It is more fluid and unpredictable in nature; every day is different than the last, and some of my projects are vastly different from others. The sands are always shifting beneath my feet. I would prefer my job to be more predictable, for my mental health, more than anything. I think that it is probably anxiety more than anything else that makes me think, pretty frequently, that I’m not working hard enough, or as hard as my peers, or that it took me too much time to do a certain task I was asked to do.</p>

			 <p>I have been fascinated by this <a href="https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/07/a-chemical-hunger-part-i-mysteries/">anonymously published paper/series of articles about the obesity epidemic</a>. <a href="https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/07/a-chemical-hunger-part-i-mysteries/">Part I</a>, covering mysteries about obesity that I did and did <em>not</em> know about, drew me in. The authors’ thesis, which isn’t presented until <a href="https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/13/a-chemical-hunger-part-iii-environmental-contaminants/">Part III</a>, is that chemical contaminants are the primary cause of the epidemic (not why individuals gain weight, but why obesity in entire populations increased dramatically since 1980). I’m not sure I buy that, but it is an interesting argument to consider that I had not previously given any weight to.</p>
<p>I was interested this that work because I am struggling with my weight again due to the pandemic. Since January 2020, when reading the news from Wuhan caused me to have a a panic attack about the coming pandemic (I was right, unfortunately). When COVID panic hit the US, and the store shelves were bare, businesses and sports leagues were shutting down, and we were afraid to leave our houses, I started to eat sweets or drink beer (just one a day) as a way to cope with the uncertainty and stress.</p>
<p>I gave up the beer last September, but giving up sweets entirely has been impossible for me thus far. Sugar is a habit I have given up several times in my life, but I always go back to it when I am feeling very bad, like if I get sick or if stressful situations last too long. The pandemic has basically never stopped being stressful for me or my family. Dealing with that stress takes a ton of energy away from me, and I end up eating extra food—sweet food—for the boost of energy it gives me. I feel a chemical dependence on it now that is stronger than I recall it being at any point in my life. I want to give it up, and am trying to find the mental resolve to do so this week.</p>

			 <p>On a whim this weekend I purchased the beat ‘em up game <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-the-game-complete-edition-switch/"><em>Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World</em></a> for the Nintendo Switch. It was an impulse purchase of a game I had not heard of and didn’t know was any good. I have been wanting to play a brawler for a while, but it is a genre I have not played since I was a kid, so I was not sure I would still enjoy it. I have been eyeing, but have been reluctant to spend $30 of $25 on, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/river-city-girls-switch/"><em>River City Girls</em></a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/streets-of-rage-4-switch/"><em>Streets of Rage 4</em></a> for weeks now. I haven’t played a game in that genre since I was a kid, and as an adult I am terrible at a lot of the games I used to excel at (I’m looking at you, Mario!) so I was not sure if I could button-mash fast enough to play such games. $25 or more is too much to spend on a game that is too hard for me to play. While I dithered about a purchase, I spent some time playing NES versions of the <em>Double Dragon</em> games and <em>River City Ransom</em>, but found those games are too primitive to be much fun for me anymore.</p>
<p>The Scott Pilgrim game was on sale for a stupidly low price ($7.49 or something), so I picked it up. To my surprise and delight, it is awesome. It has a colorful pixel art style that mimics the Scott Pilgrim comics. Its level design, character design, and animations show a lot of humor and attention to the source material. The chiptune soundtrack is really catchy. Play controls are easy to pick up. It starts out really hard, but you can replay levels to level up your character (i.e., lean new moves), and earn money to upgrade your character’s stats (strength, defense, etc.), which makes the game easier. It is kind of grind-y, at least for a conservative, low-skilled player like me, but the grind is fun.</p>
<p>Basically, everything about the video game does justice to the source material. Playing it caused me to want to reread the graphic novels, which I started to do yesterday. <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>, in comics form, is weird, surreal, and a real mess—you know, a perfect reflection of the early twenties and late teens lives of its characters. The characters, plot, and themes of the book, are complex, messy, flawed, and not fully formed. Nobody is a role model. Nobody is mature. Reality itself is warped for them. It makes no sense that Scott goes into video game mode and <em>kills</em> his girlfriend’s exes. Is that a metaphor? Only kind of. You’re just not expected to take it seriously. It’s <em>all</em> problematic—like life, I guess. I don’t really think it is deep (maybe you would if you were much younger than me), but it is really good at stirring up complicated thoughts and emotions in me about how messy life is. During this re-read, I have thought about how I might judge people who haven’t figured their lives out yet, or overlook the good qualities in someone like that. My feelings about those things are different now than they were when I first read the series about ten years ago.</p>
<p>I also watched a couple clips of the <em>Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World</em> movie on YouTube, too, and am trying to find a new respect for it. I saw the movie only once, after I had read all the graphic novels, and absolutely_hated_ it because my favorite parts of the graphic novels—the ones involving character growth—are mostly not depicted in the movie. It does have a stunning <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446029/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm">cast</a>, though; it’s unbelievable that all those young actors who became so big later on are in the same movie.</p>

Since late last week (and for hours last night) I have drafting a white paper that covers a topic at work that I am an expert in—that’s going to be a rather long project. I was just drafted into a presentation team on Friday, and I spent last evening brainstorming and I spent this evening writing an 800-word outline for it. I am teeming with ideas all of a sudden. It’s wild. But ironically I wonder what to write for myself, in my blog posts, as if I don’t have anything to say.</p>

			 <p>I characterize the mindset of American conservatives—specifically the ones who are blasé or antipathetic toward anti-COVID measures such as vaccines and face-masks—thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bad things happen to other people. That is, until they happen to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oddly enough, that is also my progressive-but-not-lunatic-fringe-liberal mindset. I figure that it is more healthy to assume I will <em>probably</em> be all right, given the precautions I take, rather than to expect the worst and be anxious about it all the time. (I’ve already done that about COVID for a solid year or more.) I prepare for the worst, so that I can protect myself and my family as best I can, but I <em>assume</em> the worst won’t happen to me.</p>
<p>I admit that new information, such as learning that breakthrough infections are a thing and that the are new COVID cases in my daughter’s school and my wife’s school every day or so, shakes this mindset quite a bit sometimes. COVID is like a specter that is constantly moving closer.</p>
<p>Based on the COVID-related stress I am still dealing with on a daily basis, this healthy-when-I-apply-it attitude is all I have to keep me going. I <em>know</em> I am whistling past the graveyard. I know the Angel of Death will not pass over my house forever. I know I am waiting for the other shoe to drop. But for now, the thought that “bad things happen to other people” is getting me from mini-crisis to mini-crisis without completely losing my mind.</p>

			 <p>On Thursday I embarked on an ambitious project related to my job. I am writing a white paper based on the presentation I wrote earlier this year, with the goal to publish it—or articles based on it—in an industry journal. It’s about how to do a certain type of project that I specialize in at work. That’s a topic I know a lot about, but have lacked the confidence to understand that it really is something valuable. By communicating my ideas to others in my presentation, I have realized that I really am knowledgeable about the area I work in, and that I have valuable ideas that I can share.</p>
<p>I am writing and editing somewhat furiously now (for me—I’m not an author) on my Mac and on my iPhone (thanks, Ulysses). I can’t stop. It is great to feel excited about and energized by a writing project again. I credit my daily writing habit on my blog for giving me the confidence to tackle a bigger writing project again. Writing something like this is no sweat for me. After all, I write for publication every day.</p>

			 <p>Viewing this <a href="https://youtu.be/cVLpdzhcU0g">wonderful lecture on the importance of a classical education</a> made me wonder if I had, or did not have, a classical education. I read a lot of great works, struggled a lot with deep reading, philosophy, and trying to understand the human condition, but I have many, many gaps in my reading and education, too. Reading <em>Ulysses</em> for the first time lately has truly impressed these shortcomings on me. I miss many allusions to classic and Christian thought, not to mention Irish history and geography.</p>
<p>For much of my life, my cynical mind has been more interested in the lies that make the world than in the truths that make the world. I am trying to reverse that balance now. Earlier this year, I made a decision to return to reading classic literature almost exclusively—even at a snail’s pace, and even if I struggle to understand it—to improve both my education and my outlook on life. I think it has been a worthwhile journey thus far, but I have far, far to go. It is a journey that ends only when I do.</p>

			 <p>According to the superintendent of schools, some parents in my town are sending their children to school wearing “fake” masks that superficially satisfy mask wearing requirements while being completely ineffectual. These masks do not protect the wearer or anybody else from COVID or any other type of disease. They are specifically designed to be as flimsy as possible; some are even see-through. It’s a product for people who want to be assholes, pretend that COVID is not real, and thumb their noses at responsible people.

			 <p>My daughter has been in school three days so far this school year. Every school day, our entire community has received an email from the superintendent of schools stating that there are new COVID cases affecting students and staff at all, or almost all, of the schools in the district.</p>
<p>This is from today’s email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As stated previously, I realize that our school community has varying viewpoints on COVID-19 and specifically on mask protocols. We are going to continue to make decisions in the best interest of safety for our students and staff. <em>In only three days of school</em>, we already have had 21 positive student cases and 10 positive staff cases. It is essential that we stay vigilant and monitor for signs and symptoms of COVID-19.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I live in a mid-sized town, and each school is pretty small, and most of the elementary schools have no air conditioning. The kids are being allowed to take off masks for “excessive heat” reasons, due to a loophole in our governor’s COVID masking mandate and due to incredible pressure by a vocal faction of parents. My wife and I believe this attitude about masks is cavalier and dangerous. We hate the idea of sending our daughter into this environment with a vaccine, and also hate the idea of pulling her out of more school because being away so long already has not been good for her mental health. All of us are frustrated and exhausted by all of this, and there does not seem to be an end to the pandemic in sight.</p>

When I do, it’s usually “good” TV that I have to pay attention to. I no longer have mindless TV shows that are good to kind-of pay attention to while folding laundry. When I was younger and lived alone, I always had sitcoms and sports on that I didn’t really care about, but were good distractions while I was puttering with something or doing light choses. That took up a huge part of my evenings. Now that I have a family, all of that is gone—mostly for the better—but I think I need a little of it back in my life sometimes.</p>

			 <p>I got my first job when I was sixteen. I was a dishwasher at a restaurant for about half of summer. Soon after I started, my mom wanted me to tell my grandfather about my new job. She was proud of me for getting a job, even though it was a job with low status and poor pay. My grandfather had worked as a short order cook and a baker for most of his life, so he was well-versed in working in a kitchen.</p>
<p>When I told him about the dishwashing job, what he said back to me was really strange. He said, “That’s great. Washing dishes is a good skill to know in case society collapses and machines won’t work anymore.” It was out of character for him to say something so cynical, and it pretty much stopped the conversation in its tracks.</p>
<p>Now it is over 25 years later, and I wonder, as I listen to podcasts dissecting news, technology, and podcasts as I wash dishes in my house four times a day: Is society going to collapse? Is climate change the thing that does us all in? Are we, as a species, extinguishing all of the natural resources we need to survive? How long is it going to take for things to start falling apart because of it? Maybe not as long as I would like it to be.</p>
<p>If that is how society collapses, perhaps machines will be the only things left that will be able to wash dishes. In that case, my dishwashing skills will not be useful after all.</p>

			 <p>I have just started to use my new Planck keyboard for work for a short, short time each day. It has been rough going so far. I expected to have trouble typing in Colemak-DH because I just started learning that layout. I did not expect to have as much trouble with chording keyboard shortcuts. The problems I am facing are making me doubt whether I really can use a 40% keyboard for work, where it would give me the most benefit.</p>
<p>On my Mac, this is almost never an issue. In general, Mac keyboard shortcuts are easier to enter, and are friendlier to laptop-style keyboards that lack certain control keys.</p>
<p>Conversely, Windows apps like Excel make heavy use of function keys (F1-F12) and operator keys (-, +, *), which, on the Planck, live on a secondary layer that requires a key held down to access. When a Windows shortcut requires a function or operator key plus a modifier key (typically Shift, Alt, or Control, or a combination of them), I find it very challenging to enter it. There are just too many keys to hold down and it gets very awkward.</p>
<p>In Excel, I especially miss a key I never even used until last year: the menu key. I must find a suitable mapping for it, because I have come to rely on it for all sorts of things, primarily special forms of pasting. Furthermore, my Windows file manager of choice, FAR Manager, assigns important functions to keys my keyboard does not even have, like Insert, Right Shift, and Right Control, and makes extensive use of Shift+Function keys for common operations such as renaming a file.</p>
<p>I am slowly figuring out how to map some of the complex key command chords I use to single keys on another layer. That may be the answer for some things, but it doesn’t scale well. I may have to adjust what software I use and how I do certain things.</p>

It is especially surprising to me because I rarely used the right shift key before I made it a goal last year to use right-shift all the time, rather than stretch my left pinky crazy distances. I think one reason left-shift is more difficult to hit is that the Colemak-DH layout keeps my fingers on the home row all the time. When I type QWERTY, my hands fly all around the keyboard like a concert pianist’s, so it feels more normal to shift my entire left hand to press the shift key.</p>
<p>To mitigate my shift problem, I enabled the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/oryx-planck">AutoShift</a> feature of my keyboard’s firmware. If I press and hold a letter key—which feels a bit like a firm press rather than a ling press—a capital letter is produced. It is a really smart feature, but I am still getting used to it, and it interrupts my flow.</p>

			 <p>I have been typing more and more each day with the Colemak-DH layout on my new <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck">Planck</a> keyboard. I basically know where all the keys are, but my typing is laborious and slow. I have to think very hard to type every word. At my best right now, I make a plan for the word I will type next, then try to execute that plan without making too many errors. At worst, I look down at the keyboard and hunt and peck.</p>
<p>I remember when learning QWERTY that, after learning where all the letters were, I started to memorize certain patterns to type particular words or parts of words. In other words, I <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com/advice/psychologists/what-is-chunking-psychology-definition-and-applications/">chunked</a> it. Typing fast was a matter of stringing along series of predefined multi-key movements which acted like mental macros.</p>
<p>I see myself at the very beginning of the chunking process right now. It will take a lot more practice to get fast, but I plan to stick with it; hopefully it will be worth it in the long run. If I can type more efficiently I believe I will incur less RSI going forward. That is my main goal in switching keyboards and layouts.</p>

Because my daughter and I are all night owls, it will be impossible for us to make up the lost sleep.

			 <p>When I was in business school, back in the early aughts, I did a team presentation project on the topic of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_pay_gap">male/female wage gap</a>. To this day, I am embarrassed at my work on this project. I was young, hard-working, and idealistic, but I was unknowingly naive to the world and think I got it all wrong.</p>
<p>At the time, I worked at an insurance company, and there was a huge number of women in the departments I worked with at manager and director levels. I was just starting out in my career, so I was lower in rank than almost every woman I worked with, too. That may have clouded my thinking a bit, because I lacked the perspective of someone who worked in a more exclusively male-dominated work culture. I didn’t see how women were treated at other workplaces.</p>
<p>To prepare for our project, which was a group presentation, I did a lot of reading on the wage gap issue. It didn’t make sense to me that it could exist. I could understand if compensation amounts averaged out with a gap between male and female average wages, but I thought there had to be a sensible reason for that. It must come down to things like the type of job taken, the number of hours worked per week, the number of overtime hours worked, employee performance, and on asking for a higher salary when applying for a job. The literature I read on the subject supported that, conditionally, but was noncommittal about whether a wage gap really existed, and about what the average male and female wage numbers actually reflected.</p>
<p>My main logical argument against the wage gap actually meaning that there was a male/female bias in the workplace, was that if women made less money for a particular job than men, I, as a rational employer, would predominantly hire women for that job, to save money on labor. That isn’t happening; therefore, the gender pay gap did not really exist. My project team was mostly young corporate women. They agreed with me. We didn’t even really argue about it, though I remember acting a little embarrassed about the conclusion I had come to when I presented it to them. We presented on the topic based on my conclusion, and otherwise had a successful, if uneventful, presentation to our class.</p>
<p>The problem is, my idea of rational hiring decisions does not reflect how the world works. People make hiring decisions—and all kinds of other decisions—for reasons that don’t make rational sense at all. At the heart of these decisions are preferences, and preferences are largely affected by bias. Bias is, essentially, a preference that can’t be adequately explained. Put another way, bias just doesn’t make sense. No sense can be made from it because it doesn’t depend on sense.</p>
<p>I came to this conclusion shortly after my team completed that project. I have thought a lot about it since. The thought of it pops into my head unexpectedly sometimes, like the memory of a time I sang the wrong line of a song in the high school musical, in front of everybody on closing night, and it crowds out memory of the rest of my performance, across all the performances, where I made no mistakes. It’s easy to dwell on the times you get things wrong, I suppose. At least in this case I learned something.</p>
<p>Now that I am older and have more experience with and exposure to the world, I notice that bias is everywhere. Bias is the sort of thought virus that nibbles away at logic and replaces it with something that feels more right or more comfortable to the thinker or decider. You do not choose to be biased; if anything, bias, soaked up from the society around them, chooses you.</p>
<p>Since I made that business school presentation years ago, my conclusion on the topic has completely reversed. Bias must affect hiring decisions and wages to the detriment of traditionally underserved or discriminated against groups of people, including women, <em>because it affects everything else</em>. Moreover, you can’t go looking for it with logic, because bias is inherently illogical.</p>

In general, the Harold Blooms of the world lost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Western_Canon">that argument</a>. <a href="https://www.aarp.org/entertainment/books/info-06-2013/books-to-read-this-summer.html">High school reading lists today</a> are far more diverse and are—as my high school English teachers feared—diluted in quality. The classics have been pared back, to make way for new ideas and more diverse voices.</p>
<p>Case in point: my wife is teaching <em>The Hunger Games</em> to high school juniors this school year. I have read <em>The Hunger Games</em> and could probably craft a few lessons based on its material, but I don’t think of it as literature; it’s a fun Y.A. beach read devoid of subtext. The dilution in quality is not a function of the increase in diversity. It’s a function of trying to hold kids’ attention.</p>
<p>I think it must be possible to make classic literature interesting and relevant to high school students. That said, it is a challenge I do not face.</p>

			 <p>After getting very upset at our daughter’s elementary school’s plan for lax COVID safety protocols announced during a webinar last night, she woke up at 4 AM this morning and wrote impassioned emails to the superintendent of schools, the school board, and the principal. She emailed and talked to other teachers at the school, our rabbi, our pediatrician, and her doctor friend to ask for advice. She and I seriously talked about disenrolling our daughter and home schooling her. After a lot of thought, though, we decided that we have to accept more risk than we are really comfortable with, for the sake of our daughter’s mental health. It was a stressful day, and we did not get what we wanted, but I am proud of all the effort that my wife put in to try to push for something better.</p>
<p>As for me, my main contributions today were cogent conversation and homemade chicken noodle soup, fresh baked bread, and salad.</p>

			 <p>When I was in college, I longed not to be learned but to be <em>wise</em>. I was learning rapidly, and soaking up new ideas all the time. I was making connections between all sorts of different systems of thought and culture. I thought I had human nature all figured out.</p>
<p>I was, however, wise enough at the time to know that I would be foolish to consider myself wise. That paradox never really resolves itself. The moment you think yourself wise, you have made a fool of yourself. Go ahead…try it, then wait a while.</p>
<p>Still, I must have shot my mouth off about how wise I was, because some people thought I <em>was</em> wise, and would ask me to help them sort out problems in their personal or academic lives. I was foolish enough back then to try to help them.</p>
<p>Now that I am middle-aged and raising two children with my wife, I feel both smarter and more foolish than ever. It is hard to feel wise when you can’t get your kids to do the simplest things most of the time. I find people–even the ones I am closest to–to be, at turns, more predictable and more inscrutable than ever. It is much easier to predict what people will do than it is to understand why.</p>
<p>What does it really mean to be wise? It’s certainly different than being smart, clever, or quick–though all those things don’t hurt. Being wise is about seeing the big picture, especially when those around you have lost sight of it, and using that viewpoint to help others help themselves.</p>

			 <p>I can write. I always could.</p>
<p>In high school, I wrote cogently and forcefully, like someone who read the up-Ed pages of two newspapers every day. Unlike most of my peers I had figured out how to revise and shape text—how to edit out hedging and weasel words and unfinished thoughts. Essay structure and organization fascinated me.</p>
<p>In college I wrote passionately with explosive figurative language. I wrote and put on a play: a farce poking fun a dorm life at my school. My seniors honors theses had jokes in them and won awards. My prose was called “airtight” in creative writing class.</p>
<p>As a young adult, I thought I might write professionally. I wrote four or five nights a week, at the local library, after work and dinner were done. I worked on short stories and screenplays that, sadly, didn’t end up going anywhere.</p>
<p>Writing was a lonely hobby for me. I had no community. I lived in the suburbs and didn’t think I could even find a writing community near me. I envied friends who lived in cities and could join writing classes or groups. The worst part of it was that I couldn’t figure out how to create interesting plots. I could write stories, but I had no stories to tell. I have no gift for plots—only for <em>telling</em>. Eventually I stopped writing entirely, in favor of business school and other things.</p>
<p>So, I can <em>write</em>. I have a <em>voice</em>. But I don’t have much to say. I never know what to write about. I lack <em>ideas</em>, which is frustrating when I have the ability (perhaps the gift) to shape and communicate them clearly.</p>
<p>Recently, I decided to write and publish…something, maybe something small, maybe a whole essay…every day, to force myself to think, write, revise, and publish even when the ideas don’t come. I think that the activity will help me get over whatever block or self-editing has been standing in the way of my writing endeavors for so long.</p>

<p>My caffeine free (or almost free) lifestyle thus far has left me with no downsides: my energy level is just fine all day. I am not tired at all during work hours, and I no longer desperately crave an afternoon coffee each day. I do fall asleep earlier at night and more easily, which is a benefit. Instead of not being able to sleep until 2 A.M. most nights, I am ready to turn in by midnight, and sometimes even earlier, which puts me more in sync with my wife.</p>

			 <p>Today I started flashing custom layouts to my new <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck">Planck EZ keyboard</a>. It runs <a href="https://qmk.fm">QMK firmware</a>, but the manufacturer has tools call <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/oryx-planck">Oryx and Wally</a> that make customizing and flashing simple. On a software level, it is the best keyboard I have ever used. On a hardware level, it is solid, too, but I am not used to the ortholinear layout yet or the layers system. Typing with my left hand, especially the letters C and X, is a little problematic for me, because the Planck requires the use of different fingers than what I use for those keys on staggered layouts. Also, I my fingers tend to land in between the keys sometimes when I have to stretch my index finger or pinkie to reach a key.</p>
<p>I have been taking <a href="https://mattgemmell.com/the-planck-keyboard/">Matt Gemmel’s blog posts about the Planck</a> as an inspiration for customizing it. Following his example, I created a numpad layout today, which will come in handy for work. I also turned on automatic capitalization, which capitalizes letters if you hold them down a tiny bit longer than a normal keypress. It is a cool feature, and may be more important for ergonomics than the layer system is for me.</p>
<p>I have also been practicing the Colemak layout on <a href="https://www.keybr.com/">Keybr.com</a>. Strangely, I could not get the web app to understand my keyboard layout unless it is in QWERTY mode; I have to emulate Colemak in the app, which is kind of a mixed blessing for now, when I could not even log into my computer in the Colemak layout.</p>
<p>All in all, it is fun to try something new. I wonder if I can actually learn the Colemak layout well enough to use it full time.</p>

			 <p>I always used to dread meeting new people. They always asked “what do you do?” And what I do (for work, naturally) has mostly been nebulous and boring and unglamorous.</p>
<p>When I worked in corporate systems, I was too young to be an interesting (read: rich) tech nerd. When I worked in management consulting, no one really knew what that meant, and neither did I. When I worked in internal audit, no one wanted to hear about it. (Let’s just say people like to complain about auditors.)</p>
<p>For much of my career I’ve had the same kind of job: an ill-defined amalgam of consultant, auditor, and regulatory examiner. When I met someone new, we would be inevitably get into conversations like this:</p>
<p>“Do you work in insurance?”</p>
<p>“No; not really.”</p>
<p>“Do you work in audit?”</p>
<p>“No; not really.”</p>
<p>“Do you work for the state?”</p>
<p>“No; not really.”</p>
<p>You would basically need a weeklong seminar in an absurdly dull hotel conference center to understand what we do at my company and why it is important. It is technical. It is dull. It involves financial solvency (yawn). It involves close reading of legislation that even the legislators probably don’t understand.</p>
<p>Recently, I figured out a better way to express what I do: I help regulators make sure insurance companies are doing what they are supposed to do. That simple, vague explanation seems to be the best one I have come up with yet. Insurance may be dull, but it has the benefit of being, well, hated by a lot of people. Everyone wants to make sure insurance companies they are customers of do what they are supposed to do.</p>
<p>I think the best answer to “what do you do?” is always “I help people.” Because if you don’t help people, then what purpose is there to anything you do.</p>

			 <p>We stayed at the beach until it got dark tonight, which was a first for us. We like to go at dinner time and stay until dusk. It is quieter and cooler then. Sunset was pretty, if a bit subdued compared to the last couple times we have gone. This time, I brought my camera, though.</p>

			 <p>Work has become stressful again. I don&rsquo;t have enough time to do everything I have to do—not just work, but taking care of my family and house, too. I&rsquo;m taking my wife and kids to the beach tonight to just hang out, which is wildly irresponsible, but may be the thing I need to clear my head.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have started to learn the Colemak keyboard layout on my new ortholinear keyboard. Colemak is a modern keyboard layout designed to reduce finger travel (and overall hand movement around the keyboard), while preserving the position of some keys that are vital for chording with the Command or Control keys: C, V, X, and Z.</p>
<p>It has been brutally slow going. I have been a touch typer on normal, staggered QWERTY keyboards for over 30 years. I taught myself touch typing on my mom’s electric typewriter from audio tapes she borrowed for me from the library. Those tapes dated from the World War II. They were Army training tapes, and their oft shouted message was that good typing skills would help defeat the Nazis, which was a pretty crazy idea to me as a child in the early 1990s. When I was in high school, I took up guitar and played all the time. As an unexpected side effect, my typing speed increased dramatically, thanks to increased dexterity honed in guitar practice.</p>
<p>My typing speed probably peaked in college at about 100 words per minute. It has slowly diminished since, due to repetitive stress injury, acute injuries to my hands and forearms, and generally bad genetic luck when it comes to wrists. I believe my typing speed now ranges between 40 and 75 WPM, at about 95% accuracy. That is certainly good enough for me, most of the time. What isn’t is that sometimes typing <em>hurts</em>, and often when that is the case, I don’t have the luxury to stop, because I have to type for work.</p>
<p>Right now, on my new keyboard, with Colemak layout, my typing speed is about 8 WPM, and that’s with only five letters in the mix! It is interesting to be tackling something I am this bad at. I feel the struggle as I practice typing. Even when I know the correct key to push, I end up pushing the wrong one (the QWERTY one) sometimes. YouTube videos on the subject have taught me to focus on accuracy rather than on speed, so that us what I am doing thus far. I plan to practice daily for a while before changing my layout permanently.</p>
<p>I typically argue that one should further develop strengths rather than try to eliminate weaknesses. It is far better to be great at a particular thing than to be average at a ton of things. At this task, though, my goal is to be average rather than a typing speed demon, just not in pain while doing it. I have been a good typer, and probably could be again if it weren’t so painful to type blazing fast for more than a new minutes at a time.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In college, I studied literature. What I learned about literature is that history, religion, and general knowledge are all wrapped up in narrative. So are our memories. We are the story we tell ourselves, as individuals, as nations, as peoples. Narrative <em>is</em> memory, and sometimes the narrator is an untrustworthy one.</p>
<p>I learned a lot about literature there, but I missed the important lesson: Why do we study literature? To learn <em>empathy</em>.</p>
<p>Lack of empathy is a fundamental problem in our society. Blame social media. Blame political polarization. Blame whatever you want. You could argue that society fractured in large part because we no longer share a common literature. We don’t read the foundational texts that, in part, make up our culture. We don’t read the foundational texts that make up other cultures—which may just help us understand other people. In school, whatever books we do read, that are “taught” to us, are dissected and analyzed, but not often enough put back together again and connected to anything real.</p>
<p>I think literature should be taught <em>to</em> teach empathy to students. Students should be told that is what it is for, and stories should be compared to real life events—not just personal experience, which is limited—as much as possible. We should think about making connections to ourselves and others, not just about connections between texts and ourselves.</p>

			 <p>When I was in high school, I was a guitar teacher. I was probably a terrible guitar teacher, but it wasn’t a job I wanted, it was a job I kind of couldn’t get out of. I had only one student, the son of a very nice teacher at my high school. After school in the drafting classroom, my student and I would listen to music he liked and try to transcribe it and learn how to play it.</p>
<p>Several times he asked me a question as we puzzled through a guitar solo: “There’s no way I’m ever going to be as good as Jimmi Hendrix, so why should I even bother playing at all?” I answered: “It doesn’t matter if it’s good. It matters that it’s yours. It matters that you did it, and it reflect what you as a person were feeling at the time.”</p>
<p>Maybe you can’t be as good at guitar as Jimmi Hendrix was, but you can be your best self at whatever you put yourself to: poetry, songwriting, fiction, musicianship, business, charity. The list goes on.</p>

			 <p>To err is human. To forgive, divine. But to have a good chance to detect and correct mistakes, you need controls. That’s what I have learned in my audit career.</p>
<p>A control helps you understand if a transaction or business process completed completely, correctly, and timely. It is designed to answer the auditor’s most probing question: “How do you know?”</p>
<p>The term itself is jargon, and isn’t widely understood outside of accounting, finance, audit, and compliance circles—unless you are pulled into an audit of some kind as a subject matter expert. One of my bosses used to say all the time, as a joking impersonation of management, “What is a control?” (It would be silly to say that joke <em>killed</em>, but we all got it.)</p>
<p>Of course “control” has a slightly different meaning in everyday language. I think most people want control over their lives: freedom, autonomy, and independence; and also, somewhat paradoxically, stability and predictability. As societal norms and expectations shift, and political, environmental and economic pressures escalate, the present feels more and more uncertain over time—it is literally out of control. As a counterweight to that, a lot of people long for strong leaders who promise to exert control by force of will, or just by force—in other words, authoritarian control.</p>
<p>The problem is that all leaders, both good and bad, know that it is easier to assert that things are correct rather than to actually correct them. In the business world, the same kind of situation applies. An executive can say that a company is doing everything it can in certain areas, but without controls and transparency, there is no way to know if such a statement is true.</p>
<p>On an individual basis, we can’t control everything that happens in our lives. What we can do, however, on an everyday personal level, is to implement the controls (in the audit sense) over what we do and the decisions we make. These can be gaurdrails and double-checks as simple as The Golden Rule and Measure Twice, Cut Once. Just ask yourself sometimes: How do you know if what you’re doing is right?</p>

			 <p>After over twenty years as a coffee drinker, I am now the owner of a drip coffee maker for the first time. <a href="https://www.mrcoffee.com/coffee-makers/view-all/mr.-coffee-5-cup-programmable-coffee-maker-25-oz.-mini-brew-brew-now-or-later-with-water-filtration-and-nylon/SAP_2132049.html">Its make and model</a> are nothing special, and it doesn’t actually brew better coffee than my <a href="https://aeropress.com">AeroPress</a> or French Press or <a href="https://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com">Chemex</a> ever did. In fact, the coffee it produces (with far less manual effort) is actually a little worse. Strangely enough, that is the whole point. I want coffee to be less enticing to me, because I am trying to wean myself off caffeine and maybe even cut coffee out of my diet entirely.</p>
<p>I think my (modest) coffee habit is causing me some health problems, and I finally came to a mindset where it seemed possible to do something about it. So far, in the few weeks since I drastically reduced my daily caffeine intake, I have noticed digestive benefits, which I expected, and also, unexpectedly, a decrease in day-to-day anxiety—which is something I didn’t even know I had until it was gone. Up until this week I worried about removing something pleasurable from my daily routine, but I am finding that there is something pleasurable in being even keeled, and, of course, in not being dependent on a drug, albeit a socially acceptable one.</p>

			 <p>Last night I told my wife I was going to go entirely to decaffeinated coffee starting today. After one look from her, I chickened out, and revised my goal to “quarter decaf”: half decaf in the morning, and full decaf in the afternoon. I still plan to eliminate (almost all) caffeine from my diet, but I am not sure if I will just drink decaf coffee twice a day, to preserve my warm beverage habit, or if I will forego coffee altogether. The latter would probably simplify my life a little bit, and is attractive, but I might go crazy drinking only water day and night.</p>

			 <p>Today I, along with a small team, gave the biggest presentation I’ve done in years: a webinar for my company’s clients. We did an outstanding job. Now that it is over, I feel relieved and exhausted.</p>
<p>I spent several months earlier this year gearing up for this day. I decided early on to level up my presentation skills, which I thought were already very good. I took the learning process very seriously. I watched hundreds of hours of video: other people’s presentations, TED talks, Apple keynotes, lectures on speaking and communication, and instructional videos about visual design, slide decks, and PowerPoint. I made prototype slide decks in which I tried different techniques, and also tried to make some of the new techniques I liked work with my company’s PowerPoint template. I threw out and revised every slide I created several times. I practiced the entire talk out loud and made revisions to the visuals and to my script to communicate my ideas more succinctly. In the revision process, the true message of my presentation became more clear, and I was able to focus more on that. Lastly, I wrote almost the entire talk down in the speaker notes, to preserve the best part of my presentation, even though I had nearly memorized the entire thing while working on it.</p>
<p>This is all probably normal stuff to professional presenters, but I’m not one of them. For the past ten years or so, I have typically presented only once or twice a year, and most of those presentations were to my coworkers (sometimes the whole company, but it’s a small company). Before this year, I didn’t rehearse my talks, and my slides, while uncluttered, were usually not visually interesting. Now, after having put in so much hard work, I think I can present very well. I have gained confidence in myself for future presentations, and feel proud of myself for what I have achieved.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I read James Joyce’s classic short story collection, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubliners"><em>Dubliners</em></a>, while I was on my vacation. I read it as part of my presswork for tackling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(novel)"><em>Ulysses</em></a>, which I am slowly navigating now.</p>
<p>I don’t normally enjoy short stories because they usually seem incomplete—cut off just before they got interesting. Short story collections are usually disjointed; I prefer collections that have common characters or plot threads that run through all the stories. I have been reading more this year than in the past, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Kitteridge"><em>Olive Kitteridge</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive,_Again"><em>Olive, Again</em></a> which I enjoyed very much. (They are called “novels,” but are in fact short story collections.)</p>
<p>The stories in <em>Dubliners</em>, of course, compose one of the archetypical collections of short stories. They are famous for the epiphanies that characters arrive at toward the end of each tale, and are devastating for the reader because those characters who recognize their personal failings or their poor lot end up doing nothing to fix things. Over and over again throughout the collection, his characters live rigid, bleak, repetitive lives, and choose comfort—and not even much comfort at all—and certainly over fulfillment and uncertainty.</p>
<p>I see the same themes in my own life. Everyone I know, including and especially myself—lives inside a rigid, repetitive routine: school, work, cooking, cleaning, a little leisure, maybe a vacation once or twice a year. Furthermore, I know that I, like some of Joyce’s characters, have chosen comfort over fulfillment—at least in terms of my career choices, and in some respects in terms of vacation travel as well. If I had taken more risks, perhaps I would have more money or status, and I might have made more of an impact on the world. My life, however, is nowhere near as bleak as the Dubliners Joyce writes about. I have a great family, a great home, and have done some great things I can be proud of. But it is chilling to think how repetitive everyday life is, and how much drudgery it entails; like Joyce’s characters in <em>Dubliners</em> each of us is stuck in a loop.</p>

			 <p>Sometimes when I’m working, I want music playing, but I don’t really know what I want to listen to, and I don’t have the patience to think about it. In these situations, I have tried listening to classical music, jazz, and lo-fi (hip-hop/trip-hop, etc.). Over the past week, I gave <a href="https://endel.io">Endel</a> an honest try, too.</p>
<p>While I enjoy classical music in a live setting, I don’t like listening to it in my headphones. Its wide dynamic range makes it so that I can’t hear some sections of it, and other sections are too loud. That doesn’t work for me; I want something that is not too loud, but is completely audible, all the time.</p>
<p>Jazz (especially classic jazz) was what I listened to almost exclusively during my senior year of college. It got me through reading and writing hundreds and hundreds of pages of text. However, I find my engagement with jazz to be all over the map. I love some of it and I hate some of it, and the kind of jazz you can just have on, not listening to—smooth jazz, I suppose—is just bad. All in all, I find jazz too distracting to listen to while I work, unless I listen to a single album that I already know and love.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music#2000s%E2%80%93present:_Hypnagogic_pop_and_chillwave">Lo-fi hip hop</a> is my favorite background music at this point. I appreciate its nearly constant beat, somewhat consistent tempos, and there appears to be a never-ending supply of it. My wife hates when I play it in the house when I am doing chores or writing, though, which means I can only really listen to it via headphones when I’m around her. It works great on my headphones while I read on my iPad, or through my loudspeakers when I work.</p>
<p>Over the past two weeks, I tried to get into Endel, which offers an AI-based soundscape that constantly changes and continually evolves as you listen to it. I like the idea a lot more than the reality of it, though I think it has a lot to do with my tinnitus. Endel is extremely treble-heavy and bass-light (really, there is no bass at all), and only one of its scenarios, Focus, has a beat. I would not describe the sounds as shrill, but they aggravate my tinnitus instead of helping me ignore it. Last week, I listened to Endel exclusively through headphones (my B&amp;O H9s and my AirPods) while I did chores like the dishes and laundry. This morning, now that I am back at work, I tried listening to the Focus soundscape for a few hours through my loudspeakers. It drove my wife and both my kids absolutely bananas. Each of them yelled at me to stop playing it, even though it was not playing loudly, and they were on a different level of the house. After that experience, I think I will not be buying an Endel lifetime subscription.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I plan to listen to <a href="https://chilledcow.com">Lofi Girl</a> for much of my workday. That is the best bet for me, when I can’t make up my mind about music and need to focus on my work more than what I am listening to.</p>

			 <p>I have been lowering my caffeine intake over the past month or so. While I don’t drink <em>that</em> much coffee, but I think that my two (strong) cups per day allotment is causing me some minor health problems. I am at the point where trying to quit (or at least drastically lower) caffeine consumption seems like a reasonable approach to try to improve things. In retrospect, it is embarrassing how long it has taken me to even consider lower caffeine intake as a possibility.</p>
<p>It has not been easy. I am trying to step down my caffeine intake by substituting decaffeinated coffee for some of the normal (good) beans in my brew. That experiment failed a couple of times; the normal ebb and flow of work-related stress led to a couple of relapses, all for a mid-afternoon boost. I restarted it when I started my vacation. I think I have been drinking about 25-30% of the caffeine in had been consuming. After a day or so I legitimately went through withdrawal symptoms: chills, headaches, and depression. I am perfectly fine now, but, from what I have read about caffeine withdrawal, I can expect even worse symptoms when I drop from some caffeine to none. I plan to stay at half-decaf levels for the next week or more, to delay that pain to a more manageable time.</p>

			 <p>One of the lies I told myself when I packed for vacation is that I would spend more time writing and coding (for fun) each day. My MacBook has sat in a box in the closet, unused for all but one evening. I did not expect:</p>
<ol>
<li>My kids going to bed at 10:00 or 11:00 PM</li>
<li>My RSI to make typing in the MacBook quite painful (at home I use an external keyboard exclusively these days)</li>
<li>Me taking up reading through the prose of James Joyce (I recently started <em>Ulysses</em>, after reading <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em> and <em>Dubliners</em>) and all sorts of related background material</li>
</ol>
<p>I am OK with this. I am resting and recuperating. I am also studying James Joyce fairly seriously late at night, which is something I would not have attempted during non-vacation time. I don’t have to churn out essays and source code to be productive.</p>

			 <p>One frequent and inescapable sight on the rural roads of New Hampshire is the Trump campaign sign. In every town, there are Trump campaign signs flanking the ends of driveways. Huge Trump/Pence billboards are proudly hoisted over the signs for legitimate businesses, presumably by the owners themselves. Trump flags—and the occasional anti-Biden flag—hang limply from the front of houses; some of them are accompanied by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again">MAGA</a> battle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lives_Matter#/media/File:Thin_Blue_Line_Flag_(United_States).svg">flag</a>: the black-and-blue parody of the Stars and Stripes. This is unusual. Trump lost almost a year ago. In every other election I have lived through, all the campaign signs came down in short order. But in 2021, in every town I drive through, I pass by monument after monument to the loser.</p>
<p>Celebrating a win for too long is gauche and sad. Mourning a loss, however old, is noble. This is especially true when that loss neatly dovetails into an even greater loss that the MAGA movement clearly draws its inspiration from: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy">The Lost Cause</a>. They both stem from the very same great lies: “this [thing I don’t like] isn’t fair” and “my humiliation is your humiliation.”</p>
<p>It is too soon to know if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie#Trump's_false_claim_of_a_stolen_election">The Big Lie</a> will have the weight and longevity of The Lost Cause. It seems likely, though, that The Big Lie will simply get folded into The Lost Cause, remembered as yet another indignity in a long line. In that way, it can last, essentially, forever.</p>
<p>Those Trump campaign signs can stay up forever, too, even after the former president runs again in 2024, retires from public life, or dies. I think that it would be a mistake to extend sympathy to the sore losers who leave them there, because what they believe—that they were cheated by a clean democratic election—undermines the American ideals of representative democracy, equal protection, and law and order.</p>
<p>The Big Lie is not going away, at least not anytime soon. It has embedded itself as the base of the Republican platform. You will see politicians run on it in 2022. The mid-term elections are going to be rough, and will merely set the table for the circus that will be the next presidential election season. We are in for a difficult couple of years ahead.</p>

Echo Lake is one of my family’s favorite spots in the White Mountains. The mountain views are beautiful and there is a large (artificial) sandy beach to sunbathe and play on.</p>
<p>We went to the nearby <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile_Lake">Profile Lake</a> instead, and ate our lunch at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man_of_the_Mountain">Old Man of the Mountain</a> viewing area.

			 <p>After a sunny, exciting day at the fair, today was overcast, cool, and low-key.
We took the kids to a playground (with a view of a mountain) and to the bookstore/toy store in nearby Littleton, New Hampshire. The kids had great fun, but we had to cut our visit to down short due to rain.</p>
<p>Ironically, for the warmest year on record, this has been the coldest stretch of days that I have ever been in the mountains. It is a welcome respite from the heat in New Jersey, but it feels like I have traveled back in time. Nighttimes feel crisp, like late August/early September when I was a child.</p>
<p>We plan to go to a lake or to a theme park soon, once the sun returns and the temperature rises.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/07/30/a-portrait-of.html">📚 A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/07/30/a-portrait-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-07-30 08:04:55 -0500">Jul 30, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I read James Joyce’s <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em> this week. I approached it in nearly the same way I approached books that I studied in college when I was an English major: I read some background about the book and where it fit into the literary cannon. I read it closely, and re-read parts that didn’t quite make sense at first. Lastly, after I finished the book, I read essays about it to make sure I didn’t miss too much of its meaning.</p>
<p>Because I did this on vacation, for fun, I held myself to a far lower standard than I did as an undergraduate. I think I understood much of what Joyce was getting at in the book, though I will admit that some of the Irish politics stuff flew over my head because I was not familiar with it. I found it fascinating that Joyce made his hero, Stephen Dedalus (a fictionalized version of himself), both a brilliant and thoughtful young man <em>and</em> an anxious, neurotic, and occasionally hubristic stuffed shirt.</p>
<p>I suppose Joyce’s loss of faith was both freeing and incredibly troubling for him, because it pervades the entire novel. The amount of religiosity in the book was a bit overwhelming to me, and far afield of what I normally encounter in the fiction I read. The oppressive superimposition of catholicism over everything reflects the oppressive superimposition of Irish identify politics over everything, too. The two are inseparable in this book: intimately entwined, and one in the same. Joyce left both behind in his real life, and as the book ends, Joyce’s stand-in, Dedalus does too.</p>
<p>Joyce’s Dublin-centered body of work, written while in self-imposed exile, leads me to believe that it impossible to cleave off certain aspects of yourself that developed you, even if you have learned to reject them and have come to resent them. Leave your home, go where you want to: you can never escape who you are.</p>

			 <p>Procrastination is just a fancy word for avoidance.</p>
<p>Socially, it is acceptable to procrastinate. After all, everyone does it sometimes. This makes it easy to not even think about <em>why</em> you are procrastinating.</p>
<p>Conversely, it is not normally acceptable to <em>avoid</em> something or someone. It smacks of cowardice, and almost no one wants to be considered a coward.</p>
<p>Think about that when you know you are procrastinating on certain tasks. Ask yourself: What am I avoiding? What am I afraid of?</p>

I use three iOS devices each day, and Reeder was showing me stale content on all of them at various points each day. I suppose local device syncing of 75 feeds was a bit too much for it to handle quickly and smoothly. I moved my RSS subscriptions back to Feedly and am once again satisfied with multi-device support.

			 <p>It’s a uniquely American thing, I have read, to work while on vacation. I have had to, as recently as last year. Some of my coworkers were reading, reviewing, and revising work papers and memos while on vacation last week. My vacation this year hasn’t technically started yet, but I am now in my family’s summer-vacation spot, my in-law’s lake house, primed to report in for remote work in the morning.</p>
<p>Next week, for me, is <em>planned</em> full-time, remote work, while on vacation with my family. I hope to have no <em>unplanned</em> work time after next week, when my vacation-proper finally begins. That kind of thing has happened in the past, and it could happen again this year.</p>
<p>I feel guilty each year for taking off two weeks with my family and finagling a weeks’ worth of remote work to tack onto it. It seems near impossible and nigh immoral to take off such an extravagant length of time from work. The idea is coming entirely from my own head at this point; no one explicitly tells me I’m doing something wrong, but it certainly feels like I am. I also wonder if my vacations are taking away from my opportunities for promotions, raises, or bonuses. In the end, it is more important to me to spend vacation time with my family, even though it feels like I am stealing that time from work.</p>

He asks why some people believe the “Big Lie” that Donald Trump really won the 2020 presidential election. His answer is an obvious but largely unspoken truth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…even the most modest amount of analysis and introspection will reveal that buying into the nonsense peddled by the former president and his clown college of cronies is not an aberration, not due to some momentary lapse on the part of the American electorate. We were raised on lies—including many lies that are much, much bigger than the big one that troubles us today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Society asks us to believe all kinds of lies. We know this. We participate in it. And, with the exception of some period of adolescence when you figure out that the adult world is full of bullshit, we never rail against it or even really think about it. But we all know, in some ways, lies hold together all of human society. Don’t be surprised if people believe them. Don’t be surprised if people <em>know</em> they are lies and still believe them.</p>

			 <p>I am neither surprised or disappointed by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/22/apple-to-pill-idos-2-emulator-from-app-store/">Apple’s impending pull of “iDOS 2” from the App Store</a>. The whole point of buying Apple hardware has always been to buy into a unique ecosystem: the “walled garden.” While the Mac has never been locked down to Apple’s Mac App Store, the iPhone has always been locked down to its App Store. It’s easy to forget now, but the iPhone grew out of Apple’s prior consumer electronics smash hit, the iPod, which was was <em>completely</em> locked down. It didn’t have an App Store. Neither did the iPhone at first, either.</p>
<p>I hate to side with one of the world’s biggest companies here, but I totally believe that the iPhone is a console, as Steve Jobs described it. I knew that going into the iPhone ecosystem, and that’s actually what I wanted, and still want, from that ecosystem. I want an apps console that (for the most part) just works, and doesn’t require a lot of my time and effort to work smoothly and securely. I came at this from the other wide: an Android users who jailbroke and hacked his phone into something completely different than what its manufacturer and mobile data provider wanted or intended. The thing is, all that customization led to a system that was unstable, and I had no idea if it was secure at all, because the code (apps and OS) came from a bunch of different places. I just had to trust, blindly, that everything was OK. The iPhone imposed guardrails on my hacking activities—guardrails that I wanted, because what I was doing wasn’t working for me anymore.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people chafe at the idea that their most useful device is a <em>console</em> because we reserve that word for entertainment devices like the Nintendo Switch and the PlayStation, or the humble cable set-top box. It doesn’t matter, though, if the iPhone is more useful and more important than a video game system, though. What matters is how it is sold.</p>
<p>It isn’t exactly a secret that normal customers can only download iOS software from Apple’s App Store. Beyond hardware, access to that App Store is the fundamental thing being sold by Apple. Customers should know it when they are choosing a product. I doubt any of the complainers and hand-wringers commenting on this article on <em>MacRumors</em> didn’t know that going into their iPhone purchase.</p>
<p>I would love to run Windows games on my Nintendo Switch, but I can’t because it is a console and Nintendo does not allow it. That doesn’t surprise me, or anybody else for that matter. The situation is not really different than the one with the iPhone. If you want to run DOS on your mobile phone, the far-more-open Android universe is there for you—and it’s the most dominant OS platform in the world, too. Vote for it with your wallets and your time.</p>

			 <p>I like <a href="https://twitter.com/Indians/status/1418565355472101378?s=20">the new name of Cleveland’s Major League Baseball team</a>. I think the team’s old name, the “Indians,” and especially its already retired <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Wahoo">Chief Wahoo</a> logo, were problematic and absolutely needed to go. If you find the term “Indians” as applied to a ball club to be inoffensive, know that that merely means you are not among the ones who are offended by it. I am sure that, at best, a lot of negative stereotyping went into the choosing of that appellation.</p>
<p>I have heard that some Cleveland fans wanted to the team to go back to one of its old names, the “Spiders.” I think that would have been a mistake. Spiders may be fearsome, but they are not widely loved and are easily squished. (I find them icky, even though they are theoretically fascinating, but that’s just me.)</p>
<p>The best part of the “Cleveland Guardians” name, in my opinion, is its positivity. After all, to guard the city is noble and brave. It is, however, a generic word that concretely identifies nothing in particular, so it is understandable that some of their fans may be disappointed.</p>
<p>The team needs a memorable mascot and logo to make whatever a “guardian” is seem strong and cool. After all, what is a “guardian?” I have most often heard the word used in the phrase “parent or guardian” which is a lot less exciting than, say, “guardians of the galaxy.” (I have tremendous respect for people who are guardians—those who take care of, and look out for the best interests of, children. That really is heroic.)</p>
<p>While I like the name “Guardians,” I will admit it is not the <em>best</em> name for a baseball team. The best baseball team name is the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford_Yard_Goats">Hartford Yard Goats</a>, but that name was already taken.</p>

			 <p>Elizabeth Nelson wrote <a href="https://www.theringer.com/tv/2021/7/21/22585724/ted-lasso-character-study-season-2">the best, most accurate take on Ted Lasso</a> (the character) that I have ever read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unceasing optimism defines Ted Lasso. But roller-coaster mood storms, manic reveries, and seemingly deliberate head games also define Ted Lasso, the players’ coach, and make him one of the best and most-layered characters of the peak TV era. He’s a man who presents himself as two-dimensional, but who might actually be playing three-dimensional chess. We delight in his antics, marinate in his charm offensive, and celebrate his offbeat approach to winning the whole fucking thing. But at all times, there’s a slight worry, one that crops up in the back of our minds, about what he might be willing to do to make it happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People love the show’s positivity, but it also has a dark side that actually makes it good. There’s something just a little <em>off</em> about Ted Lasso, and that’s what makes him interesting.</p>
<p>While Ted wins over a bunch of potential enemies in England, his wife back in Iowa can’t stand his relentless positivity. Maybe you couldn’t either, if you were married to him.</p>
<p>Ted excels at darts because he spent every Sunday in a sports bar with his dad between the ages of ten and sixteen, when his father passed away. I don’t think it is normal to bring your underage son to a bar every single week. That isn’t exactly a normal childhood. Furthermore, losing a father at sixteen may have caused some emotional trauma that Ted buries deep, causing him to overcompensate with cheery paternalism in almost every interaction.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Ted fails. He failed at his marriage, he is trying and largely failing to be a good father, and he failed to produce a winning record for his team, or even keep them in the Premier League. As appealing as Ted is to the TV audience, what he is doing is not working—or not working yet—in the world of his story.</p>
<p>What made Season 1 great was the surprising complexity of what appeared to be a dumb, one-joke sitcom based on a commercial that hardly anybody remembered. Season 2 starts to air tomorrow. I hope the writers didn’t forget about the dark undercurrents that made their show about a nice guy work so well.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>If there is one thing I would like my kids to learn from me, it is that one of the greatest, most impactful human inventions of all time is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping">double-entry bookkeeping system</a> for accounting. If my son or daughter ever throws that term out in class when a teacher is writing a list of inventions on the board, there may be some “ums” and blank stares in the classroom, but I would be very proud.</p>
<p>Tim Harford reminds us of how important the double-entry system is, and of the system’s historical origin, in his essay “<a href="https://timharford.com/2021/07/the-tyranny-of-spreadsheets/">The Tyranny of Spreadsheets</a>”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the late 1300s, the need for a solid system for accounts was evident in the outbursts of one man in particular, an Italian textile merchant named Francesco di Marco Datini. Poor Datini was surrounded by fools.</p>
<p>“You cannot see a crow in a bowlful of milk!” he berated one associate. “You could lose your way from your nose to your mouth!” he chided another.</p>
<p>Iris Origo’s vivid book The Merchant of Prato describes Datini’s everyday life and explains his problem: keeping track of everything in a complicated world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of us have always needed to keep track of everything. The knock-on effect of accountancy, going back to antiquity, is that someone wrote down what people owned and traded, what was abundant and what was rare, and even what came from where. Because of that, we have been able to learn the languages and numeric systems people wrote with, and what people valued, how they traded, and much more, in cultures that have long since passed away. It isn’t all because of the double-entry system in particular, but I think it is pretty interesting nonetheless.</p>

			 <p>When I was a kid writing essays for school, I always peppered my writing with big, fancy words in places that small, simple words would do. In part, I was showing off my big vocabulary to my teachers. For the most part, though, I was afraid to use the small, simple words because I thought of them as childish. I figured that small, simple words would make my writing seem small (as in insignificant) and simple (as in simplistic) as well. Of course, now I see that as folly. An argument that is simply stated is easier to understand, and thus more convincing, than one delivered in showy, but less comprehensible, language. While there are some glorious, complex words that I would never want to do without—<em>incarnadine</em>, <em>mellifluous</em>, <em>loquacious</em>, <em>raconteur</em>, <em>elixir</em>, <em>donnybrook</em>—I would never want an argument I write to hinge upon them.</p>

<p>Love is an emotion that does not meaningfully exist unless it is expressed through action. Actions are governed by choice. Thus, to act with love is a choice you have to make every day, many times a day. It doesn’t matter how you feel: love is what you <em>do</em>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It is popular now to lionize failure. Both fictional stories (thematically) and nonfictional accounts (explicitly) praise failure as a stepladder to greatness. It makes sense. Failure is a great teacher. It teaches us what does not work. It teaches us what we need to do better, and what we need to work harder on. It teaches us what our limitations are, and prods us into further developing our strengths.</p>
<p>While this is, in some way, timeless wisdom, the overt emphasis on it in the business book, personal productivity, and self-help space is relatively new. Our idols in business—wildly successful, and sometimes unimaginably wealthy, people—now regularly explain that they arrived at whatever monumental success they are famous for only after navigating a bumpy road potholed with failures all along the way. They tell stories about companies they started that went under, or products they developed that never found a market, or ideas they had that did not work with as much or more pride and excitement as when they talk about what actually did work for them. They talk about failure almost like it is success. They prod us to consider failure as the best learning opportunity—something to embrace rather than fear.</p>
<p>Well, sure, if you can handle it. For most people, it is a privilege to be able to fail. You have to be able to weather the storm. Not everyone can. It takes resources, like money and the right friends. It takes mental wherewithal, like good mental health (or, in some cases, psychopathy) provides. It takes opportunity, which for normal people often comes down to luck. Not everyone has those things. Not everyone who falls down can pick herself back up again. Sometimes a door closes and another one does not open up.</p>
<p>When serial entrepreneurs, angel investors, or CEOs wax on about their failures, be wary. Their discussion of past failures may be instructional, but it is also a showy way to appear humble. It disguises the privilege one often needs to survive failure without economic, emotional, or reputational humiliation.</p>
<p>Money and connections help some people fail upward. Their unsuccessful companies don’t liquidate; they get bought by other companies. They don’t go bankrupt when a business venture fails, but their employees lose their jobs and their investors take a hit. These exits are not failures; they are minor successes—at least for the owner or entrepreneur. The road to their success is not paved with failure. It actually is paved with minor success after minor success.</p>
<p>So don’t believe it when sometime tells you that experiencing failure is the only way to learn how to succeed. That simply is not true. Failure is a great teacher, but it is not the only teacher.</p>

			 <p>I think about education a lot, not only because I have kids, but also because my wife is a high school teacher, and I like to help her think up lessons. If I were a teacher, I would challenge my students to think really hard, to question what they have been told, and to go beyond the material and create new thoughts of their own based on what we discuss in class. My wife tells me that my level of instruction would suit some grad students, maybe, but not high school students, and presumably not undergrads either. That is dispiriting to me, but she would know better than I—she knows teens and young adults and intimately knows the educational system they are put through. Through her, I’m pretty aware that high school is not quite as I remembered it. Overall, it seems dumbed down compared to what I went through: loftier goals with lower expectations for achieving them.</p>
<p>I had figured that college was just the same as I remembered it—and thus would be very difficult for high school students to cope in, academically—but I am now not so sure about that. A few weeks ago, I read Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt’s <em>Atlantic</em> article “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/">The Coddling of the American Mind</a>.” It riled me up. I had seen Mr. Haidt sometime earlier discuss his thesis about the decline of thought on college campuses in favor of “safetyism” on <em>Real Time with Bill Maher</em>, and found it both compelling and dispiriting. I listened to one of his lectures on YouTube and thought about it quite for a while.</p>
<p>I went to Brandeis University—one of the schools mentioned in Lukianoff’s and Haidt’s article—in the 1990s. I remember that one of the main themes of my instruction there was that I should expect to be challenged and to confront new and potentially uncomfortable ideas. We, as a student body, we asked—explicitly—to learn about, discuss, and work through new ideas together. It wasn’t supposed to be easy. It was supposed to be difficult. Difficulty was the whole point. Open debate was how it worked. That was liberal arts scholarship—and I’m pretty sure college campuses were thought to be politically-correct, liberal romper rooms even then, so maybe even I got the watered-down version. Is the academic culture I came up in gone now, in favor of a focus on comfort and mollify action at the expense of debate and rigor?</p>
<p>Lately, I have wondered how it <em>really</em> is on college campuses. How much of this worry, put in me by some of the things I read and see, is about someone else’s hysteria about changing cultural and social norms? Are the stories about wokeness, safe spaces, trigger warnings, microaggressions, and call-out culture that I have seen on the Internet and in <em>The New York Times</em> the norm, or exceptions to the norm? What kind of story would make it all the way to me? Only the exceptional ones, I think. Maybe freedom of thought at college campus isn’t as constrained as I have been led to believe. I suppose I will find out when I explore this issue further, or years down the line when my kids are ready to look for the colleges they will attend.</p>

			 <p>I have been having a lot of trouble finding books that excite me lately. Over the past month, I read through the first <a href="https://grishaverse.com">Grishaverse</a> novels trilogy (staring with <em>Shadow and Bone</em>) and found it only OK. (It could have been a single, much faster-moving novel, I think.) I started <em>Leviathan Wakes</em>, the first novel in <em>The Expanse</em> series, and couldn’t get into it. Most recently, I started <em>Black Sun</em> by Rebecca Roanhorse and, after reading a few chapters, concluded that it is not for me.</p>
<p>This blah feeling about well-regarded sci-fi and fantasy books surprises me. I used to love those genres. Now, when reading them, I find myself distracted by details that don’t make sense, like: <em>If the planet the story takes place on is much larger than Earth, then it would have much a stronger gravity field, and all life on it would have evolved differently (i.e., be sturdier and stronger), and humans wouldn’t be able to move as easily on its surface</em>. I can suspend my disbelief to quite a big extent to accommodate an alternate history, a magic system, or a populated exoplanet. However, for the story to be satisfying, the secondary effects of these fantastical elements have to make sense and properly serve (rather than work against) the story.</p>
<p>As a young adult—after earning my English degree, and until I had kids—I only read classics. Back then, I was looking for books I could get or borrow for free, and for novels that made me feel like I was continuing my studies in literature. I strayed from that path after a while, as my professional life became more technically-oriented (I read books about programming and systems design) and as I went through business school (I read about business, economics, sociology, and so on, to understand how the world worked). I started reading for escapism (mostly) and for learning (sometimes) several years back, but I am finding it hard to get interested in anything any more.</p>
<p>I think that means that I am now ready to go back to reading classics. To that end, I started James Joyce’s <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em> last night. I love it so far. It is formally challenging, full of ideas, and grounded in the real world. I know how to tackle difficult books, and plan, at this point, to read <em>Dubliners</em> after I finish <em>Portrait</em>. I’m looking forward to it.</p>

			 <p>I decided to upgrade my Windows laptop to Windows 11 yesterday. It was an awful slog, replete with many failed Windows Update attempts, permissions issues that prevented me from changing the necessary diagnostic data sharing settings, and even a hardware firmware update. I ended up having to “reset” Windows—which deleted all my apps, data, and settings—to move forward.</p>
<p>However, hours later, once Windows had finally gotten all of its updates in, I had the opportunity to use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/">Winget</a> for the first time. Winget is Microsoft’s command line package manager. Although not as mature as the package manager I am most familiar with, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)">APT</a>, Winget <em>is</em> pretty awesome. I was able to use it from the Windows CMD shell (because Windows Terminal does not come pre-installed) to install everything I needed, from Visual Studio Code to Vim to NextDNS. It saved me a ton of time. If I set up new Windows machines frequently, I could write a script to automate all of it.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see all the developer- and administrator-friendly enhancements Microsoft has made to Windows over the past few years. Windows Terminal, Winget, and Visual Studio Code are miles ahead of what Microsoft offered just a few years ago.</p>

			 <p>I enjoyed reading <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/too-smart/">Morgan Housel’s blog post</a> on the <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/about/">Collaborate Fund</a> blog. The ideas in the post are some that I want to explore in my blog, too. All these items are direct quotations from the post:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to create complex stories makes it easy to fool people, including yourself.</li>
<li>What’s boring is often important and the smartest people are the least interested in what’s boring.</li>
<li>Intelligence can make it difficult to communicate with ordinary people, who may have the missing insight you’re looking for.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are important ideas worth looking into and thinking about. An idea from another outside source—the <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/shows/make-me-smart-with-kai-and-molly/">Make Me Smart</a> podcast—came to mind when I read the post: “None of us is as smart as all of us.” (I just learned that the Internet attributes that quote to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/56863-none-of-us-is-as-smart-as-all-of-us">Kenneth H. Blanchard</a>.)</p>

			 <p>I have been an Apple Music subscriber from the service’s very first day. I was an iTunes Match subscriber before that. I have been pulling an enormous electronic library of albums and songs forward with me since I was a teenager. We’re talking about thousands of albums, dozens of playlists, and a lot of complications that have stuck around in my library since the CD days.</p>
<p>Apple Music gobbled up all that music info and turned it into a frustrating mess for me. I have duplicate albums, duplicate tracks in my albums, unplayable tracks in some albums, and most of my library does not play in Apple Music’s new lossless format. A lot of music playing for me takes place <em>outside</em> my library, but that is in large part because my Apple Music library is an awful mess.</p>
<p>Today, I just couldn’t take the jankiness anymore, so I took the nuclear option: I deleted everything from from my Apple Music account. All my music is gone. I also turned off the “add songs from playlists added to library” option, which was inconsistently applied amongst my devices, and peppered my library with useless, one-track albums. I added some of the artists and albums I actually listen to now (as opposed to many years ago when I bought a used CD somewhere), and will rebuild my collection from there.</p>
<p>Despite my nuking of my Apple Music Library, None of the music I bought in the past is <em>really</em> gone. All the CDs I actually wanted to keep are ripped to a well-organized, if rarely touched, folder on my NAS. I will probably continue to ignore this, to be honest, and focus mainly on what’s new.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hours after Pfizer issued its statement, the FDA and Centers for Disease and Control issued a joint statement saying Americans do not need booster shots yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>In a statement to CNN on Friday, the World Health Organization said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know whether booster vaccines will be needed to maintain protection against COVID-19 until additional data is collected,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;limited data available on how long the protection from current doses lasts and whether an additional booster dose would be beneficial and for whom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How you think about this comes all down to trust.</p>
<p>Who do you trust? The companies that developed the vaccines which appear to be far more effective against COVID-19 than we could have hoped? Or the government agencies that failed to provide the correct advice about COVID-19 prevention for months.</p>
<p>Who do you trust? The companies that are seeking to profit off a pandemic by pushing possibly unneeded booster shots, using scare tactics that are familiar from their marketing of other drugs? Or the government agencies who failed to coerce a huge chunk of the adult population to get vaccinated, due to a failure in messaging, incentives and coordination of rollout?</p>
<p>It may seem like I am arguing against the FDA, CDC, and WHO here. I don’t think I am, and I certainly have no data or expertise to refute either side’s claims. I am simply observing that these institutions are deservedly suffering from an erosion in public trust, and that is going to make any decision making based on what they say, or based on what pharmaceutical companies or health care providers say, more difficult.</p>

			 <p>When I was in fourth grade, my family moved to the town across the river. The move was not traumatic, but it was socially isolating. We had to move out of our old house three months before our new house was finished being built. We ended up as the only tenants in an apartment complex across town from where we used to live. For the fall, I went to my old elementary school and saw my old neighborhood friends and familiar classmates during the day, but I saw no one my age outside of school during the week or on weekends. Besides my parents, I saw <em>no one</em> on nights and weekends.</p>
<p>As an only child, I could keep my own company. I watched a lot of TV that fall. I played a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.">Super Mario Brothers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Hunt">Duck Hunt</a>. By Christmas, I was so bored that I actually mastered playing Gyromite with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.O.B.">R.O.B. the Robot</a>, which is a game that is both preposterously difficult (I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/ocrTkuPMmvI">look at this</a>) and equally unrewarding.</p>
<p>On New Year’s Day we moved into our new house, which was newly built in in a new, single-road housing development that was not yet completed. The house was both awesome—so big! so new!—and lonely. It inhabited the unfinished end of the street; half our neighbors were empty lots. We didn’t have streetlights or mailboxes. Our front yard had no trees, no grass, and no bushes; it was a sea of straw, strewn over frozen mud. My best friend for the first week was the little TV in my room that I watched while my parents unpacked their things.</p>
<p>Starting over at school, and making what friends I could in my new, very small neighborhood—especially after months of social isolation—was tough. I would ask my parents how to make new friends in my new town, where the kids all dressed differently, talked differently, and cared about different things than the kids I was friends with in my prior life. How do you start talking to someone you don’t know without coming across like an idiot?</p>
<p>They would say, wisely, “just be yourself.” That was pretty much the only advice I ever got growing up about how to act, how to fit in, and how to be comfortable in new social situations. It is <em>terrible</em> advice.</p>
<p>When I moved to a new town, I didn’t need to “be myself.” I needed to <em>change</em> myself: to become someone flexible enough to adapt to my new situation, to meet new people halfway, to be more open to taking chances, and to care less about every moment that didn’t go so well. It took me a long time to figure that out, but I did. I adjusted. I made friends. I found my people. It took a long time, and over that time I changed myself into a person far more comfortable with who I was and who I wasn’t.</p>
<p>“Just be yourself” doesn’t mean “just be yourself.” It means <em>don’t hate yourself</em>. Truly. For every inch of “don’t change yourself to fit in” in those words, there is a mile of “put yourself out there, and don’t let yourself feel destroyed if it doesn’t work out.” Try, and try again, but don’t hate yourself when you fail to make a connection or have to put your foot in your mouth. Don’t hate yourself when you don’t measure up, don’t fit in, and don’t succeed.</p>
<p>So, when you face a new challenge in life, don’t be yourself. Be better.</p>

			 <p>I find myself thinking this, on the fifth of July, after enduring with fusillade after fusillade of illegal fireworks, and thrum of dance music blaring from several neighbors’ backyard parties, and the thump, thump, thump of basslines permeating every barrier between them and my family until almost midnight last night. (Let’s just say my kids don’t sleep on July 4th.)</p>
<p>What does America mean to me?</p>
<p>It is a promise to do better, to try harder, to fight for justice and freedom, and to stand up again after being knocked down. It is a promise that is very, very hard to keep—one most often observed in its breach.</p>
<p>What has America actually been to me? All this noise around me, for years and years and years, drowning out the voices and the actions of serious, thoughtful people. I am one of the privileged few, but I too am lost and bewildered in my own country, <em>by</em> my own country.</p>
<p>America needs to be better, and for that, <em>Americans</em> need to act better. To start, we must demand better of each other.</p>

			 <p>When <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/06/30/opensourcing-the-microblog.html">the Micro.blog client apps were open-sourced</a>, I reviewed the Github repos for the two I use most (the <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog/microblog-ios">iOS app</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog/microblog-mac/issues">macOS app</a>). I wondered if I could contribute something to the projects—probably something small, like more hardware keyboard shortcuts or an enhancement to how the post editor works. I wasn’t sure if that would be welcome, based on the brief “About the open source project…” verbiage in the REAMDE, and based on (1) the very old, but open, issues in the iOS repo, and (2) seeing no issues in the macOS repo.</p>
<p>I “know” Manton because I have been listening to <a href="https://coreint.org">his podcast with Daniel Jalkut</a> for years (which is where I learned about Micro.blog), so I think of him as thoughtful, considerate, and certainly not as unfriendly. But I did not actually expect him to open source the apps when he did, and I figure that her has a business to run and may not be ready for a bunch of user requests on client apps that he may be happy enough with already. Manton saw <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/07/02/on-opensourcing-the.html">my prior post about the apps</a> and commented on it: “I wrote that README quickly and should expand on it…”</p>
<p>In true blogging fashion, I am responding to his comment with this blog post, with the aim to be helpful to Manton as he thinks about how to expand on the README he wrote.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-look-for-in-an-open-source-project">What I look for in an open source project.</h2>
<p>Two things, really. Can I report an issue? And, can I contribute?</p>
<h3 id="issues">Issues</h3>
<p>Ideally the issues list will be kept current and will tie to development efforts (bug fixes and enhancements) going forward. Very old issues that the maintainer no longer wants worked on will be closed. Issues that the maintainer is interested in will be labeled “help wanted”, “good for beginners”, etc.</p>
<p>The maintainer should say in the README how user-reported issues will be addressed. It is OK to state that the maintainer does not plan to consider some or all feature requests from users. It is best to be open and realistic about how the project will operate.</p>
<h3 id="contributing">Contributing</h3>
<p>I always look for a CONTRIBUTING document or section in the README to learn whether or not the maintainer will accept pull requests, and if possible, how that process should work. Is opening an issue, then resolving it with a pull request later on, the right way or the wrong way to go about it? I have worked with maintainers who preferred that approach, to solicit conversation, and have worked with others who preferred the code change to come first and the discussion afterward.</p>
<p>Also, it is OK if the maintainer is not going to accept pull requests; I would rather know up front.</p>
<h3 id="the-future">The future</h3>
<p>I think it is perfectly OK if the way a project is maintained changes over time. Not every decision made on day one has to be carried out forever. As a potential contributor, I just like to know what I might expect if I approached the maintainer now.</p>

			 <p>On Thursday I configured NextDNS to block (for my personal devices only) news.google.com. Google News has been my Internet obsession since it debuted in 2002. It is not a healthy one. Whenever my mind gets lost for a second, I find myself opening a browser tab and checking Google News to see…what’s new, I guess. Sometimes I close Google News out of disgust or boredom and then, almost immediately, open it up again.</p>
<p>Why do I do this? What am I searching for? What is going on in my mind?</p>
<p>Reading the news seems like a worthwhile activity—something a thoughtful, intelligent person would do—but I am pretty sure that most of the time it isn’t. I think that news sites and cable networks exploit the part of our brains that are always scanning for threats and opportunities, as part of our survival instincts. In Paleolithic times, knowing if the tribe across the river is friendly or hostile, knowing where the good game is and where the predators are, and knowing what foods might kill you were all important to survival. All of that information is relevant and timely.</p>
<p>But that’s not what I get from Google News. I rarely learn about anything nearby that could possibly affect me. I usually learn about national affairs, faraway disasters, or (more recently) some else’s social media-published outrage about these things. It’s hard to say that provides me much benefit at all. So, for the time being, I’m turning it off. The news will still be there when I need it, but not packaged in such a way that hooks me and makes me feel virtuous for being hooked on it.</p>

		<a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/07/02/on-opensourcing-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-07-02 21:24:16 -0500">Jul 2, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This week <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/06/30/opensourcing-the-microblog.html">open-sourced the iOS and macOS Micro.blog apps</a>. I think that is a great move in general, but it is not one of the things I require in the software I use. I never felt that comfortable when, a while ago now, I read users’ blog posts expressing anger or dismay that the client apps were not open-sourced. (Let’s put aside, for now, that what makes Micro.blog <em>work</em> is the server-side code.)</p>
<p>As a paying customer, and as a developer myself, I don’t think Manton and his team are obligated to share their client source code with me. I don’t think anyone is. If they want to, that’s great—but it is no guarantee that the client app itself will be better, more secure, more feature-rich, or even have a future many years from now. Heck, <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog/microblog-ios/blob/master/README.md">it doesn’t even look likely that Micro.blog will accept pull requests</a>, so it is unclear whether open-sourcing it will change its development direction or iteration time at all. I’m not complaining about that, though. Maintaining an open source project/community and running a successful blog hosting business are almost entirely orthogonal to each other. Open source doesn’t really give me added comfort that an app I love or depend on will be there for me forever, because nothing is forever, even open-source software projects.</p>
<p>As a computer user and enthusiast, I used to care a lot more that I do now about free, libre, and open-source software. My primary reason was that I thought I could trust it more than closed source software. It is harder to hide malware, tracking, and obvious security flaws when the code is publicly viewable. History has shown that not to be entirely true. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Remember Heartbleed</a>? That incident showed us that widely used libraries may be maintained by only one or two people, and their source code can contain bugs and security flaws that go unnoticed for years, because no one is actually looking at the source code.</p>
<p>My secondary reason for preferring open-source software was more theoretical, but larger in scope and more exciting to me: open-source software can be a more practical and a better use of humanity’s programming resources. That’s because one of the great, unfulfilled promises of computer science is the ability to solve a certain problem once and for all, for everybody. Open source utilities, like the Unix command line tools, and open-source libraries, like OpenSSL, theoretically could make this happen. But it didn’t happen, at least not fully. We spend a lot of time, collectively, solving the same software problems over and over again. We may approach these problems in new ways, with new languages, and on new platforms. But in the end, we are repeating ourselves. Imagine where we could be if we didn’t keep repeat ourselves!</p>
<p>I actually think that most of the repetition is the inevitable result of human nature. Humans are curious; we want to know how something works, and how to do it ourselves. Humans are also prideful: we think “I can do the same thing, but better.” Most importantly, humans need to learn; each of us is born knowing nothing, and must learn extensively from our forebears to push our collective knowledge out just a little further.</p>
<p>In the end, what is most useful to me about Micro.blog open-sourcing its codebase is that I can look at it and learn from it. That could be very helpful. Long ago, I was interested in creating a dead-simple iOS app (extension, widget, whatever) for Micropub posting. Eventually, well before this week, Micro.blog open-sourced its <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog/snippets">Snippets</a> library, which would have made writing such an app much easier. Now, with the client app <em>also</em> open sourced, I could review <em>its</em> code to see (presumably) how to call, configure, and use the Snippets library in an iOS app. That is even more useful than the Snippets library alone.</p>
<p>Now that the Micro.blog client app source code is free and open, maybe I could use some of it to help me build that little utility app now. In the same vein, maybe someone else could use much more of that source code and build a better, more feature-rich client app based on it. Maybe the Micro.blog app is a solved problem, and no one has to solve it again (at least until Apple stops supporting the frameworks it is based on), and a hundred other Micropub-blogging-based small businesses could spring up, all using a common client app. Who knows? That possibility is a risk to Manton and Micro.blog, but it is also a gift to the greater world.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/06/30/on-bullies-or.html">On bullies, or why I have character</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/06/30/on-bullies-or.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-06-30 20:45:42 -0500">Jun 30, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I often joke with people that I am not as nice as my wife is. It’s a self-deprecating remark, but I do mean it. I <em>am</em> a nice person, just not <em>as</em> nice as my wife is.</p>
<p>I’m not <em>as</em> nice because I was bullied for most of my childhood. I never got beaten up (though I did get into fights), and I was never afraid to go to school (though it was a gauntlet and a crucible), but I was picked on mercilessly, incessantly, and for <em>everything</em>—my name, my weight, my glasses, and most of all for being smart.</p>
<p>When I was a young adult, I would say that the bullying led me to develop <em>character</em>—and, man, I wish I didn’t have character! As a middle-aged adult, I find myself wondering what that bullying really taught me. I think, in a huge way, it taught me to distrust people—especially people my own age. It taught me not to take what people said to me at face value, because venomous words are often preceded by honeyed ones. It taught me that others may switch from allies to enemies when the social situation changes, like when the bullies enter the scene.</p>
<p>One of my triumphs in life was when I finally made the bullying stop. After years of trying different things—there is a lot of well-meaning advice for the bullied out there to follow—what finally made the bullying stop was a 30-second conversation I had with one of my bullies, in the back of a classroom on the first day of seventh grade. After being on the receiving end of some stupid taunt, I had had enough. I turned to the kid, looked him in the eye, and said to him: “You can say whatever you want to me. You can call me whatever names you want. But you can never hurt me. You can never change my mind about myself, no matter what you do.”</p>
<p>For some reason I still can’t figure out, the name calling, the taunting, and the scapegoating stopped overnight—not just from that one kid; from everybody. I didn’t become popular or anything, but I was mentally strong, and everyone knew it. The bullies just stopped bullying me. I was no longer a social pariah. I made a lot of new friends that year. Even some of the kids who picked on me even became my friends before the school year was through.</p>
<p>That single exchange, by itself, probably did not cause the bullying to stop. Asserting that I was mentally stronger than my bullies probably would not have worked unless it were really true. It was the last of a series of defenses I developed over the years. It was the strongest one, but I may not have developed it if I hadn’t developed others before it, like wit, determination, and resilience.</p>
<p>Bullying has shaped me to be someone who, as I have been told, does not suffer fools gladly. It has made me wary of people and likely to question others’ intentions, which is a great skill in political situations and in some professional situations, but it isn’t that useful for socializing at a picnic. It has also shaped me into someone who has tremendous sympathy for the downtrodden, quiet underdogs of the world. I can empathize with the pain of others. I know that true friends are rare and precious. I know that inner strength is hard won.</p>
<p>I also know that I am not as nice as other people, because other people were not as nice to me. So I try, really hard, to be nice, even when it is difficult, because people deserve better than I got when I was a kid.</p>

			 <p>I have recently finished crafting a slideshow, and writing a talk to go with it, that is the best one I have ever done, probably by a mile. I spent hundreds of hours this year watching talks on YouTube (both good and bad ones), watching instructional videos on speaking and on creating effective visual presentations, and trying new slide design techniques (and throwing out all the things I tried that didn’t work). I tried really hard to push myself out of my PowerPoint design rut. I thought I was good at presenting <em>before</em>, but now I think I have really leveled up. I have internalized a lot of the lessons I learned this year.</p>
<p>The most visually impressive, most engaging, most well written talk that I have ever created is due to my bosses tomorrow. It is complete. It would make for a great 80 minute talk. But it has to be cut, and maybe cut down by half. It was momentarily agonizing to learn this today, but I am trying to think positively about it, because I have learned the right way to cut (iteratively, though rehearsals and timing of sections) and I know how to not cut the meat out of the presentation (because I wrote down the main idea of each section, so it wouldn’t get lost in an edit). I can do it. I just wish I didn’t have to.</p>
<p>No matter what, though, I’m going to be proud of what I built, and I’m going to seek out more opportunities to present in the future. I <em>am</em> good at it. I put in the work to be even better at it. And maybe with enough practice I can be great at it.</p>

			 <p>One of the difficulties my family has had due to the pandemic is finding a suitable summer camp experience for my nine-year-old daughter. She <em>loves</em> camp, and there was <em>no</em> camp last year. This summer, we opted for what we thought was the safest camp option: a drama camp that promised to be outside only (under tents and such) or virtual if the weather was bad (presumably, if it rained).</p>
<p>Yesterday, a day before camp starts (which is today), the camp changed its terms. It would count heat and humidity as bad weather and would move camp indoors pretty much full time, based on the weather forecasts we have around here. The camp surveyed parents over the weekend and the majority of the parents presumably agreed to this. We, however, did not.</p>
<p>My wife is trying to find an alternative camp now, which is not easy last minute (at least around here). Camps start enrolling in October (which seems absolutely crazy to me). I hope she can work something out.</p>
<p>What I find frustrating about summer now (and this is in New Jersey, not exactly in the South) is that the heat, humidity, air quality, and afternoon thunderstorms make outdoor activities incredibly difficult. It seems like summer is not a good time for summer camp anymore, which doesn’t make sense.</p>

			 <p>My work week has overflowed with head-desk moments, turnarounds, and setbacks. It has been frustrating beyond belief. It’s not often that I experience big parts of my work projects blowing up in my face, especially for unexpected reasons. Fortunately, all the problems I am facing are technology-related, not interpersonal, and can, I think, be solved by doing something I, by nature, kind of hate doing: asking for help.</p>
<p>I am trying to change my mindset from “I can’t do this anymore” to “I can do this. I may need help. And it may take longer than expected.” It sounds simple, but it really isn’t. For whatever reason, whatever I picked up from the self-help and coaching industries over the years taught me a misleading lesson about personal achievement, which basically boils down to “it’s mind over matter.” But sometimes, the problem really is matter—the external roadblocks, rather than the internal ones. At least, that’s what I think about this week’s challenge. If I can’t remove those roadblocks myself, then maybe someone else can help me.</p>

			 <p>My wife teaches speech, debate, and dramatic arts to high school students. I love it when she asks me to help her with her lesson plans, because it gives me the chance to take a subject that she has to teach, however uninteresting it may seem (especially if you’ve taught it for 10+ years in a row), and blow it up into something that is the foundation of everything.</p>
<p>Here’s an exchange we had this spring:</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: What’s the curriculum?</p>
<p><strong>Her</strong>: Persuasive speech.</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: <em>All</em> speech is persuasive speech.</p>
<p><strong>Her</strong>: That’s not helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: But it’s true!</p>
<p>I always encourage her to start new topics with audacious statements that demand defending. I’m not sure if she ever does, but I think it is important to tie everything you learn about writing and speaking with the fundamental forces that drive communication.</p>
<p>In another life, I would have ended up teaching English at some level, too. I think I would make an excellent high school teach for one or two very smart kids, and a potentially disastrous one for everyone else.</p>

			 <p>“Real artists ship.” Steve Jobs said that to motivate the Macintosh team in 1983. It’s a statement that reverberates in my mind and absolutely drives me crazy sometimes. Why? Because I have tons of code that I haven’t shipped. Hell, some of my <em>best</em> code hasn’t shipped.</p>
<p>At some point, I lost my nerve. I couldn’t finish the projects I started. I couldn’t make a small change to a UI because it would inevitably spiral out into something that would require a rewrite of the entire app. I let new components I created lie unused. I let the revisions and extensions I had written for my apps linger and die on the vine. I couldn’t integrate the pieces into a coherent whole.</p>
<p>I let myself become too tired or too distracted to focus on the problems in front of me. I couldn’t resolve the problems I had created for myself. I couldn’t think straight, and didn’t trust that I could do it anymore.</p>
<p>I realize now that I was bumping into my limits as a developer, which is scary and frustrating. I opted to run away from these limits rather than to either work past them or to accept them. I am trying to do better and not get bogged down in all the feelings I have developed about this over the past couple years.</p>
<p>In the past I have failed. But I am trying to work through it now, to push past the fear, to move from “I can’t do this” to “I <em>can</em> do this,” and to get through the hard parts of getting my best code shipped. I can do it this time, and I won’t give up. All it takes is will, grit, and patience.</p>

Almost every one I write starts with “Hi, &lt;name&gt;.” It seems perfectly normal, until you realize that every email client already includes that in the “To” field above the body of the message. The reader knows her own name, and it is written on the screen in the “To” field next to her email address. Why do I write it again in the body of the email? Why do I do this 50 times every workday? Why do I do this even though I think it is redundant?</p>
<p>Simple: Because I think that everyone’s favorite word is their own name. Everyone likes to see it. It’s subtle flattery to include it atop the body of every email message. Whenever I think I should just stop my habit of typing it, I remind myself of this and keep going with it, because I think in the end it is worthwhile.</p>

			 <p><em>Ted Lasso</em> season 2 has unexpectedly huge shoes to fill. I have not been heartened by either of the two <a href="https://youtu.be/reP1gVGpFKo">previews</a>, which I think are veering too far into the cute end of the show’s tone.</p>
<p>I loved the first season, and hope they can keep what make season 1 so engaging keep going. It wasn’t the cuteness of Ted’s cheery attitude. It was the overcoming of cynicism in everybody else that made it interesting. You need that cynicism to be there for there to be genuine tension between the characters.</p>
<p>The previews make the think that that tension is completely gone, at least among the main cast. I hope the writers came up with new ways to explore conflicts and create drama that don’t lean too much on tired TV tropes (new characters, character personality resets, and so on).</p>

			 <p>One of the best lessons that literature has taught me is that the bad guy <em>thinks</em> he’s the good guy. In more abstract terms, the villain thinks she is the hero of her own story. That is what drives villains, and that is what makes them dangerous.</p>
<p>Sometimes, as in real life, the villain may in fact <em>be</em> the hero of his own story, because the story as we know it isn’t over, and it isn’t about what we thought it was about. Any narrative can have a counter narrative. Every comedy might be someone else’s tragedy.</p>
<p>All of this is true in life as it is in art.</p>
<p>There are real villains in the real world, and we need real heroes to face them. But there are a lot of false villains in our lives that we also face. These false villains may be people we are mad at momentarily, people we are close to who frustrate us, people who shun us, people who are indifferent to us, and so on. These false villains may also be ourselves—the fears and doubts that hold us back, the shames we keep secret from ourselves, and the pasts that we cannot change.</p>
<p>We must be careful not to think of these false villains as the real ones. Not all stories need a hero to resolve them. When we play the hero, we may unknowingly be playing the villain instead.</p>

			 <p>I am teaching my daughter how to solve problems. <em>Math</em> problems.</p>
<p>I find or think up challenging math problems for her (she is a third grader), and, to make them more fun, I rewrite them to include mention of her friends and family, favorite characters, and favorite things. We work through them together before bedtime. It’s fun, and we both get a lot out of it.</p>
<p>I always close our math session by asking her a question. The questions I ask are meant to spark introspection and, I hope, foster self-worth: <em>What is something you like about yourself? What is something you like to do? What is something are you good at? What are some things people you like have in common?</em></p>
<p>The questions I want <em>her</em> to ask in life—when learning new things, when engaging with people, and when confronting political forces in the world—are the big, probing kind: <em>What is this all about? Why is it important? What does that even mean? How do you know?</em></p>
<p>These are simple questions, but they carry a lot of weight when asked earnestly, and also when asked recursively to get to the bottom of something. They are at the forefront of my mind all the time (especially <em>how do you know?</em>) because I believe they are at the heart of thoughtful inquiry. (They may also be at the heart of skepticism or even a healthy distrust, but that is something for me to unpack later.)</p>
<p>As a father, I have no idea how to teach her to ask these questions. How do you teach someone to <em>not be afraid</em> to ask these questions? How do you teach someone to <em>not get upset</em> at the answers? How do you teach someone to deal with indifference, rejection, or even malice? I don’t know. I can only ask her big questions enough times for her to get used to them.</p>
<p>As she grows older and more confident, the other big questions I want her to ask are: <em>What can I do?</em> and <em>Why not me?</em> Those questions are even harder to ask, harder to answer, and I certainly don’t have the right answers to them. Part of the my journey through fatherhood is to try to figure them out.</p>

			 <p>I already know that one of my Father&rsquo;s Day presents is a nice warm L.L. Bean blanket. It&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;m old and need a nap. It&rsquo;s for watching TV at night in the summer. To keep our upstairs anywhere near comfortable for sleeping, our central air has to work very hard. This makes our TV room, which is one of the lowest rooms in the house, absolutely freezing.</p>
<p>My house has central air but we also have room air conditioners in two of the upstairs bedrooms because the central air is not enough to cool them. I think that the root of the problem is that our house does not have enough ductwork upstairs. My house was built in 1980. I wonder if the central air system was designed for 1980 levels of heat, which were lower on average, because it certainly can&rsquo;t keep up with 2020 levels for the top half of the house.</p>
<p>I could be wrong about that, because I see climate change all over the place around me, and it might just be fatalism on my part. But I think I am at least partially right.</p>

			 <p>Seth Godin says that everyone should have a blog. Moreover, everyone who has a blog should blog <em>daily</em>, primarily because it reinforces the idea that the important thing about it is to show up, every day, day after day, and actually do it. Well, <em>this</em> is showing up. I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about how I can be better at everything I do. I&rsquo;m trying to build myself up, brick by brick, after whatever the heck happened to me during the COVID-19 pandemic. (One weird thing I noticed is that I have started to <em>prefix</em> the pandemic with a descriptor. It&rsquo;s as if I imagine we will need to differentiate between several.) I am teaching myself new things. I am taking more chances. I am talking to more people. I am trying harder to focus on what is vital.</p>
<p>The effort has been paying off; at first slowly, and now more quickly every week. I think, as the weeks keep going by, I will seek out more opportunities to do good things, to grow, and to connect with the world again.</p>

			 <p>Last night I became unreasonably upset that UIKit does not let me use an inline date picker (the date picker control that looks like a calendar) as an input view (i.e., in place of the software keyboard on the iPhone). There is some kind of maximum height of the input view/keyboard area, and the top of the date picker gets truncated. I tried a lot of ways to make it work, but I guess I’ll have to wrap it in a popover and have some “special cases” code paths in my view controller to make it work. How frustrating! I just need about 15 points more vertical space!</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/technology/bitcoin-untraceable-pipeline-ransomware.html">Nicole Perlroth, Erin Griffith and Katie Benner report, in <em>The New York Times</em>, on how the Justice Department traced and recouped a huge ransomware payment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin is also traceable. While the digital currency can be created, moved and stored outside the purview of any government or financial institution, each payment is recorded in a permanent fixed ledger, called the blockchain.</p>
<p>That means all Bitcoin transactions are out in the open. The Bitcoin ledger can be viewed by anyone who is plugged into the blockchain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin was never really anonymous. It is pseudonymous, so it makes sense that transactions can be traced to some extent and tied to a unique owner or wallet.</p>
<p>What is interesting is not <em>just</em> that law enforcement can identify which Bitcoin wallet was involved in the fraud, but also that law enforcement could also crack the wallet’s password and retrieve/steal the money out of it. I wonder how. Was it a weak password? Was it social engineering? Was it a brute-force password crack? If so, was it cracked by a normal computer or by a quantum computer that no one else knows about?</p>
<p>Bitcoin seems fundamentally broken to me. I won’t touch it.</p>

			 <p>I have been following stories about aphantasia with interest because I am 99% sure I have it. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/08/science/minds-eye-mental-pictures-psychology.html">Carl Zimmer reports in <em>The New York Times</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Adam Zeman didn’t give much thought to the mind’s eye until he met someone who didn’t have one. In 2005, the British neurologist saw a patient who said that a minor surgical procedure had taken away his ability to conjure images.</p>
<p>Over the 16 years since that first patient, Dr. Zeman and his colleagues have heard from more than 12,000 people who say they don’t have any such mental camera. The scientists estimate that tens of millions of people share the condition, which they’ve named aphantasia, and millions more experience extraordinarily strong mental imagery, called hyperphantasia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I read a book, I never think about what the characters look like, or what the scenery is.</p>
<p>When I think, it’s all words. Torrents and torrent of words.</p>
<p>I don’t have the best visual memory for people or places, though I have good spatial awareness.</p>
<p>I think I <em>can</em> form mental images, or at least simulacra of them (wireframes, maybe). I mean, I did pretty well in organic chemistry in college, which is a subject that is, in part, about visualizing the rotation of irregularly shaped molecules. I don’t think I <em>saw</em> them in my mind’s eye, though. Not really. It was long ago, so I can’t remember reliably, but I probably figured out a different way to do it.</p>
<p>To me, it is interesting to learn that some people “see” mental images easily and think in an incredibly visual manner, because that is not the way I experience anything.</p>

While I am <em>more</em> sympathetic to Osaka’s position, I think we should all end the charade of bringing up an athlete in front of a media panel to answer for her poor performance or to gloat about her good performance in a match. It is frivolous and adds no value. Didn’t Bill Belichick expose the futility of the sports press conference twenty years ago or more?</p>

			 <p>I enjoyed <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/05/24/burnout-modern-affliction-or-human-condition">Jill Lepore&rsquo;s recent article on burnout</a> in <em>The New Yorker</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Burnout is a combat metaphor. In the conditions of late capitalism, from the Reagan era forward, work, for many people, has come to feel like a battlefield, and daily life, including politics and life online, like yet more slaughter. People across all walks of life—rich and poor, young and old, caretakers and the cared for, the faithful and the faithless—really are worn down, wiped out, threadbare, on edge, battered, and battle-scarred. Lockdowns, too, are features of war, as if each one of us, amid not only the pandemic but also acts of terrorism and mass shootings and armed insurrections, were now engaged in a Hobbesian battle for existence, civil life having become a war zone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lepore argues for cultural and economic origins for burnout, which make for a useful lens through which to study the phenomenon. Personally, I think the burnout really is a manifestation of depression, specifically of high-functioning depression coupled with exhaustion. Lepore touches on this, too.</p>
<p>Burnout still feels like its own thing to me, because I experience the feeling at my desk during the work day. Fortunately, I have learned (or am still learning) to slow down and demand less of myself, and of those around me, when I am feeling burnt out.</p>

Often when I do this, while I wait for builds to complete or unit tests to execute, I pick up my Rubik’s Cube and solve it (or scramble it, if it is already solved). For the past three days, I could not solve my Rubik’s Cube anymore. I couldn’t remember how to do it, and I kept making mistakes even in the earlier portions of my solve. I worried that I had forgotten how to do it overnight, and the implications of that scared me.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I solved the cube again today again without an issue. It was a great relief. I think that I was so deep into technical problems for so long that I lost the plasticity of mind I usually have.</p>

<p>Sadly, it looks pretty awful. The background mostly leaves a halo around me un-obscured; sometimes it clips portions of my face or shoulder off. I have a very high-end laptop and a “very good” Logitech webcam (all webcams are terrible, I think), so I have concluded that WebEx’s technology is way behind Zoom’s, which does the virtual backgrounds flawlessly. I think I will leave virtual backgrounds on, for privacy reasons, and hope no one minds the weird visual side effects.</p>

			 <p>Phew! I finally fixed a bug that bedeviled me for days. (Well, <em>nights</em>, because it is in my hobby project.) The fix was adding two lines of <em>very basic</em> code to a function that hasn&rsquo;t been touched in years. I think the Swift compiler changed something about implicit protocol compliance, and it caused the function to stop processing the intended read/write logic for one of my protocol data types. I&rsquo;m rewriting that library to not need that function anymore, and must code some better tests for it than I did before.</p>
<p>Now I can go back to writing the fun, <em>new</em> library that will make my code much easier to deal with going forward.</p>

			 <p>I think that Apple is going to lose whatever antitrust cases are eventually brought against it in the EU and in the US. I don’t actually think Apple <em>should</em> lose, because I don’t think it is correct to call Apple a monopoly.</p>
<p>The general antitrust argument against Apple is that its App Store platform is too locked down, and that is unfair because Apple is a monopoly (insert eye roll here) of its own platform. App is a platform owner. Of course it has a “monopoly” over the platform it owns. That doesn’t make it a monopoly in the overall marketplace. Moreover, while iOS is undoubtedly popular, it is a <em>minority</em> smartphone platform, which in the broadest legal terms that I understand, makes monopoly-related antitrust law not apply to them.</p>
<p>App developers have to accept Apple’s terms, and pay a pretty large commission to Apple, to distribute apps in the store or to take in-app purchases. That may not feel fair to developers, but I can’t take seriously the arguments that it is illegal. It is the same way that game consoles work. Will we go after Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft next? Shouldn’t they open up their game consoles to alternative payment systems and alternate app stores, too? I have heard of no one seriously arguing this.</p>
<p>The most compelling argument against Apple’s App Store requirements is that Apple demands too much money from developers for distribution and payment solutions that other companies now offer at lower prices. I am sympathetic to this argument because I too think Apple should have lowered its commission over the years, as marginal costs for these technologies and services have declined. However, the size of Apple’s cut is not really at issue here. Apple, rather clumsily, lowered its commission for a majority of its developers to 15%, starting in January 2021, but the antitrust talk just keeps rolling on.</p>
<p>The second most compelling argument against Apple is that it uses its platform-owner advantage to position its own software and services over third-party competitors. Again, I sympathize. Apple Sherlocks developers sometimes, and can position its own software and services over anyone else’s. So does Microsoft (ever use Windows?). Amazon exercises a tremendous advantage over third party sellers in its online marketplace.</p>
<p>I could argue that even Linux vendors, such as Ubuntu, position their own, preferred software over that of third-party developers. Software platform owners always have advantages over third parties that operate on their platform. Extracting as much value from that as is possible is the entire point of creating and owning a platform. I think it only becomes an antitrust problem when a company has majority market share, which Apple does not have.</p>
<p>If developers can’t accept Apple’s terms, then they shouldn’t. They should develop for Android instead, which has the majority market share anyway, or create progressive web apps. (Remember, the web is an app platform, too, not just a way to collect credit card payments for software.) If developers “need” to develop for iOS because iOS users, on average, spend way more money on apps than Android users, then that just shows the value Apple’s marketplace has, and <em>is</em> worth paying for.</p>
<p>Despite my views, I still think Apple is poised to lose any legal actions about them regarding monopoly. It won’t lose based on the merits of whatever case is brought against it; it will lose because enough political sentiment is against Apple, at least in this area, and that is all that matters. Perhaps all the tech giants will fall under this scrutiny, and all will be forced to open up their platforms more widely, and will be forced to renounce their first-party advantage when distributing applications and features. I just don’t see that actually happening, and if it does happen, I don’t think it will benefit anybody in the way government regulators would expect. It could even stifle the development of the next generation of technology platforms.</p>

(Honestly, what I want is the ObinsKit software that powers the Anne Pro 2 to apply work on it.)</p>
<p>I set up a new RGB color scheme and remapped my CapsLock to Control, saved them to the keyboard’s local profile, and (out of habit) configured the Zeus Engine to <em>not</em> start every time I log on.

<p>I don’t know anything in particular about Apple’s plans, but it seems crazy to me to expect a faster chip at this time. What I would expect is more I/O, driven by more cores and supported by more RAM. Of course, I could be wrong. Maybe Apple can overvolt the M1 to get more speed out of it, and will call it by another name.</p>

It is a puzzle game where you, essentially, build a machine with various component parts to move a ball (well, the game calls it a “binary cell”) from one part of the screen to another. It sounds simple, and it starts out fairly simple, but it becomes very challenging as you progress. It’s the sort of game a programmer, or anyone who enjoyed <em><a href="https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine">Human Resource Machine</a></em> would enjoy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gomez is a 2D creature living in a 2D world. Or is he? When the existence of a mysterious 3rd dimension is revealed to him, Gomez is sent out on a journey that will take him to the very end of time and space. Use your ability to navigate 3D structures from 4 distinct classic 2D perspectives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a 2D puzzle platformer where your character can rotate the environment left or right 90 degrees at a time, but you always interact with the environment in two dimensions. Some of the puzzles are quite challenging, but I think that the most hidden secrets that you can get from solving the hardest puzzles are all optional to completing the game. It’s a charming game, and easily my favorite Switch game of this year so far.</p>

It seems like not a day goes by without a <em>New York Times</em> news alert about it. (I plan to turn those alerts off after I finish writing this.) This time, a gunman killed seven people, then himself.

<p>I think the news media covers mass shootings like they are exciting, like some kind of action movie where bad outcomes only happen to the extras, and the rest of us get to watch. But “one or two minutes” isn’t an action movie. It isn’t something exciting. It’s actually, really, really stupid. That such a thing is even possible, outside a war, is embarrassing and shameful to all of us. I wish it were more widely considered to be.</p>

<p>Kuo says that next year Apple will drop the 5.4-inch model and run with two 6.1-inch models instead, one Pro, one regular.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rumor is a prime reason I upgraded to the iPhone 12 mini early this year. I absolutely love the size and weight of it. It fits better in my hands and in my pockets than my iPhone 7 Plus ever did. However, the 12 mini’s small screen size makes it less compelling to read on, edit photos on, or watch videos on. These are all things I do pretty much every day without complaint, but if it were going to be my only portable device I would have bought one with a bigger screen.</p>
<p>I have no desire to go back to a larger phone, because the phone, for me, is one tool among many, rather than the center of my computing universe. It doesn’t have to be compelling, just useful. It doesn’t have to be used constantly, just when it makes the most sense to.</p>
<p>Some time from now, I think the smartphone, as a thing I carry around all the time, and as the default “Internet communication device,” is going to disappear and be replaced by something else: smart glasses maybe, or some kind of earpiece (when I am really old and need hearing aides).</p>

Both sizes will ship with Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors or AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series processors.

<p>If I was more of a Windows guy I would probably buy only Microsoft-brand laptops at this point. They don’t always have the best specs, but I like their designs a lot.</p>
<p>I spend most of my computing time using Windows for work. I try to forget that I have a Lenovo laptop by putting it behind a giant monitor and using an external keyboard and trackball to operate it. Lenovo laptops are good, I guess, as long as I don’t have to touch them. I don’t like their keyboards (both in terms of layout and feel) or the pointing devices (the trackpad is too small, and I’m done with using the trackpoint/eraserhead thing). The Surface Laptops keyboards and trackpads have always seemed a lot more sensible to me in how they are designed.</p>

			 <p>Last year when I was looking for something soothing to watch on YouTube, I came across James Hoffmann’s many videos about coffee, coffee machines, coffee products, and so on. I have watched a ton of them, mostly because I like his voice and demeanor. <a href="https://youtu.be/aidvrssMSGo">His latest video</a> is about the <a href="https://aeropress.com">AeroPress</a>, which I have used for many, many years. I actually learned something new from it: People use the funnel, which is meant to help put your coffee grounds into the press without making a mess, to brew coffee into cups with mouths too small for the bottom of the AeroPress. I have to try that! He also states in the video that the AeroPress is easy to make good coffee from, but is difficult to master. I actually put very little effort into my AeroPress use—far less than I used to when I first starting using it. I have found that my AeroPress brewing technique, no matter how sloppy or lazy, doesn’t seem to affect my coffee all that much. It prefer not stressing about it anymore.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I turned off the <a href="https://flashquark.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AnnePro2_UserManual_en.pdf">tap layer on my Anne Pro 2 keyboard</a> which is basically only for using <code>Fn</code>, <code>Fn2</code>. right-<code>Ctrl</code>, and right <code>Swift</code> keys as arrow keys. (The keyboard does not have dedicated arrow keys.)</p>
<p>I did this because I think the tap layer causes me a lot of problems, like the cursor moving up a line when I just meant to press the <code>Shift</code> key for its normal function. I also think it may be contributing to double keypresses somehow, but it could also be that I am still not used to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/7de612/kailh_box_white_review/">Khial Box White switches</a>, which have a different actuation point than the Cherry MX Blues I usually type on.</p>
<p>Now, I am trying to get used to typing <code>Fn</code> + WASD for arrow keys. It&rsquo;s not too bad, but it makes some keyboard shortcuts in Visual Studio Code, like &ldquo;expand selection&rdquo; (<code>Ctrl</code>+<code>Alt</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>Right Arrow</code>, which is now<code>Fn</code>+<code>D</code>) almost impossible to pull off. I even started looking into switching to <a href="https://www.vim.org">Vim</a> or a Vim-mode plugin for Visual Studio Code, so I didn&rsquo;t have to use arrow keys at all. I gave up Vim pretty quickly, though. I know enough Vim to exit it (ha!) and edit config files, and that&rsquo;s more than enough usage for me right now.</p>
<p>All in all, my typing has been more accurate since turning off the tap layer, but I have also had to think about how to use the arrow keys each time I use <code>Fn</code>+WASD, especially if there are other modifier keys involved. I have found myself using the mouse a lot more for text selection and navigation than I am used to, which is reminding me of how I used a Macintosh at school when I was a kid.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I wasted an hour last night trying to install <a href="https://qmk.fm">QMK firmware</a> on my work computer’s mechanical keyboard, a <a href="https://www.durgod.com/page9?product_id=47&amp;_l=en">Durgod Taurus K320</a>. I have a love/hate relationship with it. I love that it has the best build quality, rigidity, stabilization, keycaps, and typing feel and sound of any of the many (many!) keyboards I have owned over the years. I hate that its software is buggy: so buggy that sometimes the keyboard hangs and I have to unplug it to fix it; so buggy that I have to plug it in directly to my laptop rather than through a USB hub; so buggy that that I cannot program its layers the way I want to.</p>
<p>Very recently, someone figured out how to run QMK firmware on it, which could resolve the stability and customizability problems I have with the board. Unfortunately, I was not able to figure out how to flash the firmware to the keyboard. The main problem I faced was that the keyboard was not recognized by the QMK Toolkit software (on Windows) even after I put the keyboard into bootloader mode, and even after I started messing with the bootloader firmware using <a href="https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/guides/driver_installation_zadig">Zadig</a>.</p>
<p>After lots of tries, I couldn’t figure out. I think I dodged a bullet, though, because I’m not sure QMK can control the RGB backlighting, which, on this keyboard, is necessary to see the key legends. Fortunately, despite me trying to mess with it, my keyboard still works as well as it did before. It’s not perfect, and I really would like to create a more robust <code>Fn</code> (function key) layer, but I will live with it for now.</p>

			 <p>Today I made the mistake to look up someone I knew while I was in high school. I was reading an article about illegal drugs, and thought about a high school friend’s younger brother who ran into some drug problems about 20 years ago. Sadly, I discovered that he died last year. I can only conjecture, but it seems, based on what else happened to him over the past few years, that drug problems led to his premature death. Learning about what happened to him made me very sad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple’s gaming subscription service just got a massive influx of new titles. The headliner is Fantasian — the latest release from the creator of Final Fantasy — which is joined by other titles like new versions of NBA 2K and The Oregon Trail, and World of Demons from PlatinumGames. As part of the update, the service is getting two new categories of games: Apple calls them “Timeless Classics” and “App Store Greats.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I literally just canceled my (second) Apple Arcade free trial twelve hours before this announcement. I just can’t seem to get into Apple Arcade at all. For the most part, the reason is that I find my iPhone 12 mini to be too small to be a compelling gaming device. Secondarily, I don’t want to get into a complex, involved game on my iPhone or iPad. I prefer my mobile games to be simple things that can be jumped into and out of, more like the “Timeless Classics” that Apple is now adding to Apple Arcade. It’s too bad for Apple Arcade that I already own almost all of those games.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Federal health officials gave the green light Friday for fully vaccinated people to resume travel as an estimated 100 million Americans have had at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine, and evidence mounts of the shots’ effectiveness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s good news, but it doesn’t make me want to go out and travel by plane or train anytime soon.</p>
<p>I am fully vaccinated, but my kids are not (because, of course, there is no approved vaccine for children yet), and that dramatically limits my desire to travel, eat in indoor restaurants, or do any indoor activities in public unless they are absolutely necessary. I understand that it is probably quite safe for me to do some of these activities (provided I wear a mask, etc.), but it seems to me that doing so would still be (even more) uncomfortable and unpleasant (than it was before).</p>
<p>My wife and I have been talking every day about what is OK or not OK for us to do now that we are vaccinated. Despite both being vaccinated, we are still not comfortable dining in restaurants or staying in hotels (don’t even talk about flying!), but we have realized that we are way behind our friends and acquaintances in terms of risk taking. We remain concerned about our children being explored to the virus, and about the rising and “extremely high” (per <em>The New York Times</em>) COVID-19 risk level our county is currently at. It just doesn’t make sense for us to change our behavior that much yet—at least not until the local COVID infection numbers go down quite a bit, which won’t happen until after a lot more people get vaccinated.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356180/openai-gpt-3-text-generation-words-day">James Vincent reports in <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best-known AI text-generator is OpenAI’s GPT-3, which the company recently announced is now being used in more than 300 different apps, by “tens of thousands” of developers, and producing 4.5 billion words per day. That’s a lot of robot verbiage. This may be an arbitrary milestone for OpenAI to celebrate, but it’s also a useful indicator of the growing scale, impact, and commercial potential of AI text generation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The obvious industry target for auto-text is journalism. It is already being used there for sports reporting, and could probably be used for local government reporting too. There are other areas it will encroach on that are news-adjacent (think financial news or business book digest services like Blinkist), like education and entertainment.</p>
<p>I’m an auditor, and I think that, eventually, auto-text is going to destroy about 50% of our billable hours. Auditors spend a <em>ton</em> of time writing. We document our procedures. We record our work. We summarize our findings. We write reports for our clients. Making sense of all the work, both for our own understanding and for our client’s, for the sake of writing it down, takes a lot of time. Moreover, the simple act of typing it out and, especially, hyperlinking everything together so we support our conclusions, requires a lot of manual work. Some of this work is communicative, but a lot of it (like the hyperlinking part) is mechanical. Consequently, much of it is ripe for automation.</p>
<p>I think, though, that transforming this laborious and time-consuming writing process into something auto-generated by a bot would produce a lot more <em>information</em> but a lot less <em>knowledge</em> than we had before. You gain a lot more understanding how a company, business process, or control works by writing about it than by reading about it. Why? Because writing is <em>thinking</em>. To write well is mentally strenuous. It requires you to think how you would communicate an idea to someone else, notably someone else with a different perspective and different knowledge than you have. At the end of the writing process, you should understand your subject backwards and forwards and from all sides; you could probably describe it in a number of different ways; and you will likely remember the gist of it, and specific nuances about it, for far longer than you would if you had just read about it in a report.</p>
<p>The world won’t end, and few will shed tears, when AI writes audit reports and work papers. Audits cost money, and businesses mostly don’t think they benefit from them. If it makes the auditors less knowledgeable, however, side effects will develop, and those will be long-lasting. Knowledgable auditors help make good control environments possible, which leads to more stable and more solvent companies. Decreasing the understanding of auditors could make systems and processes more unstable and less trustworthy over time. Additionally, knowledgable auditors often move to the business side and go on to manage well-controlled organizations. While the auditor-to-manager career path will likely continue, such moves would not result in the same level of management quality if the auditors don’t have to think as deeply about what they are auditing as they did before the AI text-bots took over. Neither of these side effects bodes particularly well for the people the auditors and the audited companies (and their fancy AI) serve.</p>

			 <p>I stayed up late last night drafting a new, Hugo-driven version of one of my websites. I went from having nothing at all built to having about one third of the site done in a couple hours. The result, I think, will be more plain (and maybe more ugly) than the existing site, but it will be less janky on mobile devices.</p>
<p>I sank a lot of time over the past week looking for a Hugo theme that is perfect for my needs, but I couldn’t find one. For the sake of achieving my simple goal of refreshing my tiny websites, I gave up the goal of visual perfection, and am driving forward with a theme that I think is OK that works well enough for me.</p>
<p>From my perspective, I want my site to be easier to maintain and add content. That is more important to me than having a site that looks really slick. My old websites don’t look slick anymore, anyway: No one is fooled by outdated HTML templates into thinking that my very niche apps are developed by a huge, sophisticated software corporation.</p>

			 <p>I watched episode one of <a href="https://www.marvel.com/tv-shows/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier/1"><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a> this week. It’s a show about two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe">MCU</a> characters I don’t particularly care that much about, so it wasn’t something I was really looking forward to, but I pay for Disney+ anyway and thought I may as well check it out. Reader, I liked it!</p>
<p>My first impression is that it looks like it cost a zillion dollars. Special-effects-wise, it looks on par with the Marvel movies. Based on that alone, I could see why Disney originally wanted it to premiere first, before <em>WandaVision</em> and whatever other Marvel shows are being developed.</p>
<p>My second impression is that I appreciated that it was trying to tell a Black story as well as a super hero story. I am not optimistic that Sam’s (The Falcon’s) family side story is going to be anything but predictable, but it is nice to see an attempt to give the character some grounding in reality. Race is an issue that touches everything in American life, unfortunately. In some ways, it would be disrespectful to Sam’s character and to the audience not to address that in some way.</p>
<p>I don’t have anything bad to say about the Winter Soldier part of the show, but it isn’t as interesting to me. I expect it to follow a predictable “antihero almost, but doesn’t quite, make good” formula, but maybe the writers will surprise me.</p>
<p>Predictability aside, I’m just glad to have something new and fun to watch.</p>

			 <p>I was thinking about creating a training presentation to help my coworkers with keyboards shortcuts, but was dismayed to see that our Lenovo laptop keyboards (which I never use, because I work from home and use external peripherals) don’t even have a menu key. Someone decided that <code>Print Screen</code> was more important, which may even be true, but it doesn’t help me make a good presentation for my coworkers. The menu key alternative, <code>Shift+F10</code> is going to be a very hard sell, especially because <code>F10</code> on the laptop requires the <code>Fn</code> key to be pressed, too.</p>
<p>I have gone from someone who did not use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_key">menu key</a> on my keyboard for 20+ years (since it was invented in the 1990s) to someone who can’t live without it (on my Windows at least). I made it a point to start using it a few months ago, and now I use it constantly. I recommend that all Windows users with an ANSI or ISO keyboard layout check it out. That key is positioned right underneath your thumb when you use the arrow keys.</p>

			 <p>I was not I initially interested at all in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Snyder%27s_Justice_League">Snyder Cut of <em>Justice League</em></a> but I ended up watching it anyway, over two nights. I’m glad I did.</p>
<p>I thought the theatrical release of <em>Justice League</em> was pretty bad, but not quite as bad as the professional movie review consensus was. I figured that the Snyder cut must be better, but I was surprised at how much better it is. Granted, it still isn’t <em>good</em>. It doesn’t fix its pacing problems. It still is not as brisk and pleasurable as the best of the Marvel movies. It doesn’t tell a cohesive story, but it also crams in too many story lines for a non-DC fan to keep track of. It still has some dumb script problems, such every single part of the nonsensical museum height/terrorist bombing blot in the opening Wonder Woman scene, that could have been solved by editing a few sentences of dialog. While not exactly <em>good</em>, it is a good bad movie now. Its reach often exceeds its grasp, but it offers a lot of interesting material to people who are already fans. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to be the kind of movie that would bring a lot new fans in.</p>
<p>It is now very clear to me that Zach Snyder’s vision was dark and wild and weird—definitely too much of all of those things to launch a successful franchise—but Joss Whedon’s contributions were just awful: tasteless, asinine, nonsensical, and insulting to the audience. Whedon’s dialog (notably Superman’s and The Flash’s) and the character moments he created, like the race between The Flash and Superman, are embarrassing to watch and make the characters seem stupid. Snyder’s cut simply had better dialog for them. Simply getting rid of the random <em>people</em> that Whedon put into that nuclear wasteland Russian city—the one that existed in the movie only to be destroyed in a bout of cinematic excess—made the climax bearable. Who needs to worry about a family who shouldn’t be living in a nuclear wasteland anyway when the entire world is already at stake? Whedon really did screw up that movie.</p>
<p>I think that the Snyder Cut works very well for fans of the comics, especially fans of the “what-if” versions of all the famous characters. Some fans, like me, believe that comic book characters are archetypes, and really can be <em>anything</em>, and no representation of them is truly canonical. The grim, dark version of the Justice League is an interesting thought experiment, one of many worth exploring. It is not something I ever felt hung up on as “not the real version” of Superman or whatever. The Snyder Cut isn’t the real version of the DC Universe to me, because nothing is. It’s all just ideas and entertainment anyway.</p>

			 <p>I have been using <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com">AutoHotKey</a> for many years, and I never thought until today to map <code>Windows+Q</code> to quit the active app and close the active window. That creates something very similar to Mac’s <code>Command+Q</code> shortcut to Windows.</p>
<p>The default Windows keyboard shortcut for quitting an app is <code>Alt+F4</code>, which is a two hand operation for me. Note that in AutoHotKey, you don’t even need to send that key command; you can use the WinClose function instead:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#q::  
WinClose, A  
Return  
</code></pre><p>One of the best things Apple has ever done with their support of keyboard shortcuts was to pretend that function keys (<code>F1</code> through <code>F12</code>) don’t exist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the company’s “Engineering the Future” announcement today, Gelsinger announced plans to outsource more of Intel’s chip production to third-party foundries; a $20 billion investment into two new fabs in Arizona; and a new branch of the company called Intel Foundry Services, which will see Intel’s foundries produce chips for other companies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intel has had an awful decade, having missed out on smartphone chips and having stalled out at their 14nm process for years. Still, it is a strategically important company for my country, and I have to ill will toward it, even if I don’t prefer their products right now. I would love to see them become competitive again.</p>
<p>The idea of Intel fabbing chips for other companies is a big deal. Intel has never done that before. It seems to me like it could be the first step of spinning off that part of the business into its own company, and focusing on process shrinks in ways that the fully integrated Intel could not before.</p>

			 <p>Josh Berlinger of <em>CNN</em> reports today that <a href="http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_d3f4ea80ea0d81acb5d30fcf939c3243">the Colorado attack is the 7th mass shooting in 7 days in the US</a>.</p>
<p>It seemed like there were periods in recent years in which we had a deadly mass shooting in the national news at least every week, if not several times each week. There has been something of a pause due to COVID, for understandable reasons. Unfortunately, we seem to be un-pausing now. Sadly, mass shooting rates in the U.S. seem to be getting back to normal.</p>
<p>But what is “normal?” It is actually hard to know what is normal for gun violence in the U.S. Here’s an interesting factoid from the article about my country’s gun problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear how this number of mass shootings compares to an average week in the US.</p>
<p>Though some official gun violence data is available, the US federal government does not have a centralized system or database to track firearm incidents and mass shootings nationwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks some gun violence data, nearly 40,000 people were killed in incidents involving firearms in 2019.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article omits the reason for this: There are actually <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-government-study-gun-violence/story?id=50300379">laws against government agencies, such as the CDC, accurately tracking gun violence</a>. That’s just stupid and self-defeating. While dying due to gun violence is incredibly unlikely, statistically speaking, it is also completely unnecessary. We should treat <a href="https://usafacts.org/data/topics/security-safety/crime-and-justice/firearms/firearm-deaths/">all gun deaths</a> as <em>preventable</em> and <em>unacceptable</em>. Only then can we have the mental and moral clarity to do something about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its guidance for schools. On Friday, the agency announced it &ldquo;now recommends that, with universal masking, students should maintain a distance of at least 3 feet in classroom settings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Previously the guidance stated, &ldquo;Physical distancing (at least 6 feet) should be maximized to the greatest extent possible.&rdquo; The new guidelines still call for 6 feet of distance between adults and students as well as in common areas, such as auditoriums, and when masks are off, such as while eating. And the 6-foot distancing rule still applies for the general public in settings such as grocery stores.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This news is causing a good deal of consternation in my family. COVID cases are going up in our local schools right now. There has been an extremely high risk level in the community for several weeks, and in-person instruction is expanding anyway. Our school systems have been flatly stating that they will open even though they cannot conform with some of the requirements. This change in CDC requirements makes it easier for them to comply.</p>
<p>I think the changing of, and complexity in, the distancing rules makes them seem suspect and less likely to be followed at all. This concern is counterbalanced, however, by my belief that distancing helps very little in the classroom, because every classroom I have seen has poor ventilation. My wife and I are keeping our kids remote until the end of the school year. We are still hopeful enough to consider September as the right time to send them back to in-person learning.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-new-ipad-pro-leaks-ahead-of-rumored-event/">Corinne Reichert and Stephen Shankland report in <em>CNET</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple will launch a series of new iPads in April, a report Wednesday said. The new iPad Pros will come with Apple&rsquo;s homemade M1 chips, a Thunderbolt port, and better cameras and screens, according to Bloomberg. They will reportedly come in 11- and 12.9-inch display sizes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s cool. Maybe I’m not a “Pro” but the iPad Air 4 is just about perfect for me. From my layman’s perspective, the A14-based chip in the iPad Air 4 is very similar to the M1, minus some of the cores. The 2020 iPad Pro’s chip (an A12Z) is a generation or two behind that, though it has more cores than the A14 does. Apple obviously needs to remedy that to help justify the iPad Pro’s greater price.</p>
<p>I am thinking that the “Thunderbolt” port is merely following the direction that everything with a USB-C connector is going in: USB 4 compatibility. That, plus more processor cores, sounds good for videographers, podcasters, photographers, and (I guess) gamers. Unfortunately, if Apple doesn’t fix some problems with the Files app (just try transferring a gigabyte-sized file off your iPad to a network share—I’ll wait&hellip;for it to fail), these performance boosts will be hamstrung.</p>

<li>Focus on one idea per slide</li>
<li>Focus on very few visual elements/focus points per slide (e.g., five or six, maximum)</li>
<li>Light text on a dark background is easier on the eye</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, when I try to apply those ideas, I feel like I’m not getting anywhere. All of my slides look completely conventional: no better than those I created many years ago. I think they are effective, but they are ugly and boring. It does not help that I have to present on topics that are dry and technical in nature. I also feel hamstrung by my company’s PowerPoint template, which is quite busy, focuses attention on the wrong areas of the slide (i.e., the title and the footer), and has (almost completely) black text on a white background.</p>
<p>I think I need to invent a visual style that I can get away with on at least some of my slides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-bleed images that cover the entire slide, and obviate the need for titles or footers on my slides.</li>
<li>Text boxes that float over the images, or captions that fill in the top title area that is already part of our PowerPoint template.</li>
</ul>
<p>I just hope, if I do these things, my slides won’t end up looking like tired internet memes.</p>

I know reviewers love it, because it is a return to form, but I was hoping for something different. It’s hard to say, what, though. Something that’s a mix of fun and depressing, like my favorite Hold Steady lyrics, I guess.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-will-focus-on-mini/">Matthew Panzarino of <em>TechCrunch</em> reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple has discontinued its original HomePod after four years. It says that it will continue to produce and focus on the HomePod mini, introduced last year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I, like many audiophiles, passed on the original HomePod due to its high price and lack of connectivity. I’m sure I would have enjoyed how it sounded, and its size is just right for me, but I would likely have had to buy two of them to be fully satisfied (stereo separation is important to me). At $349 each, that was too expensive.</p>
<p>The smaller, cheaper HomePod mini holds little appeal to me, and seems to be a far less interesting product for the audio engineers at Apple to work on. For all I know, though, it sells in huge numbers, which makes it interesting in and of itself. Maybe a HomePod mini max (ha!) will be released someday, at around $150, which will hit the price/performance sweet spot I am looking for.</p>

			 <p>I guess, based on the occurrence of a President Biden speech, that this week marks <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/Voices/2021/03/12/Joe-Biden-COVID-19-anniversary-speech-full-text/8161615555448/">the one-year anniversary of COVID-19 in the United States</a>. To me, the baleful presence of COVID-19 has been around for what feels like much, much longer—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic">so long that I can’t even remember it clearly</a>.</p>
<p>My COVID panic started in early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_January_2020">January</a>, when we thought the disease was only in Wuhan. In America, for a couple weeks at least, it still seemed likely that the disease would never leave China, much like H1N1 and SARS never made a big impact here. For almost three months my mental state caromed between what I think of now as irrational fear and rational fear. I could see the whole year of 2020 play out in my imagination, way before my friends and family could see what was coming, but I could do nothing to stop it, and I could do almost nothing to protect my family from it. All those feelings felt very real and very debilitating, even when almost no one else around me was feeling them.</p>
<p>I had about two months of angst about COVID before it actually hit around here. The last time I went out with friends and family was, I think, on March 14, 2020. We went to see a musical and when out to eat at a crowded restaurant afterward. It was really hard for me to feel comfortable the entire time, but I didn’t want to let everybody down because I was concerned about a pandemic that hadn’t hit our area yet. Less than a week later, my entire family was on lockdown.</p>
<p>Back in January, February, and early March 2020, it didn’t help me at all to have known about the scope and length and shape of prior pandemics, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu">Spanish Flu</a>, which I know, from reading family letters, killed a bunch of people in my extended family about a hundred years ago. It didn’t help me at all to know what I should do and buy to prepare for it. It didn’t help me at all that I am smart enough to think for myself and to scrutinize, with a pretty good understanding of the relevant science and statistics, the information and advice experts were providing to us. All of these things just made me feel more uncertain and more cynical about what was going on.</p>
<p>A year later, I am feeling more hopeful. I have the vaccine after all, and am probably (but not definitely) immune to COVID 18. But my <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/monmouth-new-jersey-covid-cases.html">county is still at extremely high risk level</a>. The numbers are still higher than they were last year when all of us were in a panic. Despite that, all the states, even blue states like mine, are reopening rapidly and throwing caution to the wind, when it would be more prudent to do so more gradually. It makes me nervous that we are giving the virus a chance to circulate long enough to adapt resistance to our vaccines.</p>
<p>I was early in being scared of COVID, and I may be late in getting over that fear. I just hope that, when I look forward from today, whatever fear I feel is merely anxiety over things that will not play out, rather than the accurate foresight into the future that I had late last winter.</p>

It seems to marry <em>Hollow Knight</em> environments, character movement, and platforming challenges to <em>Castlevania</em> character- and background design.

<p>The more Metroidvania games I play, the more I think that <em>Hollow Knight</em> is the best one ever. Platforming and combat are fast and fluid, it nails the difficulty curve,  it doesn&rsquo;t require grinding (unlike the Castlevania games), it allows for slow or fast play, and so on. I could go on and on about it.</p>

<p>This is a sad story. My first thought was that Amanda Gorman could legitimately have been harmed in a situation like this. Then I thought, she should have a bodyguard or an entourage with her at all times for protection. <em>Then</em> I thought, she should not need to! That could ruin her life.</p>
<p>Amanda Gorman is a strong and bold speaker, and deserves the last word on the matter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In a sense, he was right,&rdquo; the former National Youth Poet Laureate added. &ldquo;I AM A THREAT: a threat to injustice, to inequality, to ignorance. Anyone who speaks the truth and walks with hope is an obvious and fatal danger to the powers that be.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Tonight I learned about <a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/">Mermaid</a>, which is a plaintext markup language and renderer for creating flowcharts and other kinds of diagrams.</p>
<p>I want to make flowcharts quickly for my technical projects at work, but i don’t have Visio, and I hate fiddling with a GUI to line up shapes and worry about arrow lengths and so on. The way my mind works, I just want to type out what I want and have software figure out how to lay it out for me. I don’t care that much how it looks, as long as it is simple and makes sense.</p>
<p>Mermaid’s plaintext premise is really cool, and the syntax is flexible enough to not be awful. It is way more flexible than the examples on The Mermaid website originally led me to believe. You can name each shape whatever you like (not just single letter identifiers) and you can define the content (shapes) and relationships (arrows) separately if you want to. The only thing that stinks is that you have to manually insert html break tags (<code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>) for line breaks, because there is no word wrap.</p>
<p>I still need to figure out what the best renderer is for me.

<p>The shows is a <a href="https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/tags/mecha">mecha anime</a>. Its premise is that, in some future war in which big robots piloted by people fight each other, a new type of mech is developed that is remotely controlled by very rare, very special kind of person. That person must bind her mind to the mech through a lot of hand-wavey technology called gen:lock.</p>
<p>The problem is, we learn three things in the final two episodes of season 1 that make the pilots unnecessary:</p>
<ol>
<li>A person’s mind can uploaded to, and downloaded from, a digital brain</li>
<li>A digital brain can be copied an indefinite number of times.</li>
<li>A digital brain is all that is needed to drive a mech</li>
</ol>
<p>If one pilot’s mind can be copied, without harming her, and then bound to any number of mechs, then why do we need the pilots at all, once you’ve got the first one’s mind copied? If the pilots aren’t really necessary, why haven’t the characters in charge of the gen:lock program figured that out yet?</p>
<p>I’m not sure I will pick it up again when season 2 comes out. Maybe this kind of anime isn’t for me.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/04/jay-z-sells-majority-stake-in-tidal-music-streaming-service-to-jack-dorseys-square">Per Mark Sweeney in <em>The Guardian</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Why would a music streaming company and a financial services company join forces?!,” Dorsey posted on Twitter, posing the obvious question as he announced the news. “It comes down to a simple idea: finding new ways for artists to support their work. New ideas are found at intersections, and we believe there is a compelling one between music and the economy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is great news if you&rsquo;re Jay-Z. He will cash out cash out with a tidy profit for his also-ran music service. I was surprised to learn that Tidal&rsquo;s value appreciated so much since he bought it.</p>
<p>It sure seems like a bad deal for Square, though, who accepts a ton of business risk without much benefit. I probably don&rsquo;t know what Tidal&rsquo;s cultural cache is—I had assumed that most people had never heard of it—so I can&rsquo;t appreciate its value. Still, even if the acquisition sounds like a bad idea, $300 million is play money to the Jay-Zs and Jack Dorseys of the world, so who cares?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But much of Tanden’s résumé was overshadowed by her proliferous online posting — at least 1,000 tweets raking both Republicans and leftist Democrats over the coals — that Tanden quietly started deleting in November 2020.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven’t been following this story, but my interest was piqued when I learned that Neera Tanden’s nomination chances were in jeopardy because of her tweets from the past. People keep getting in trouble for what they post to Twitter. (“Social media” in these cases always is Twitter, too. That is probably just because it is public facing, though it is also a popular place for broadcasting, calling out, and grandstanding.)</p>
<p>It will soon be the conventional wisdom that those who seek high offices—in public service or in private industry—should have no public social media presence, no blog—certainly no Twitter account—maybe no public online presence at all. That bothers me because I think there is value in publishing one’s thoughts to the world, in a blog, vlog, podcast, or whatever other medium I can&rsquo;t even conceive of yet. People have an urge to share and should not feel that they will be punished for it, especially years after they tap the “post” button.</p>
<p>I understand that some people are deliberately awful on social media, and that <em>is</em> a problem, but isn&rsquo;t it also a problem that “the Internet never forgets?” <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">The right to be forgotten</a> is at both ridiculous to ask for and essential for people to get along with each other after a certain point. How should we evaluate a person based on what she posted online? Does it matter how long ago a thought was posted? What is fair? I think we are at a cultural crossroads regarding these questions, and may be stuck at that crossroads for a long, long time.</p>

<p>I definitely don&rsquo;t have the hang of using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> yet, but I&rsquo;m learning.

In the interest of getting something that is not bare HTML published, I created some meaningless blog posts.</p>
<p>The last time I used a static website publisher, I had to create my own themes from scratch. The hard part with that was in creating something that looked halfway decent on various screen sizes. With Hugo, there are a ton of great themes available, but they all have constraints about what content the site must contain. That is tough for me right now because I don&rsquo;t know how to change those settings, and I mostly want to create very simple sites.</p>

			 <p>Trust relies on three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Competence—can you do something well?</li>
<li>Benevolence—are you doing good?</li>
<li>Integrity—will you do the right thing, even when things are bad for you?</li>
</ol>
<p>I heard this breakdown on a podcast episode earlier this week, and loved the idea so much that I hastily dictated a note to Siri about it (I was in my car at the time), but I can’t recall which podcast I heard it on or who said it. I found an analogous summary of the idea on the Wiley Online Library site, in an abstract about a chapter of the book <em><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119206422.ch21">Handbook of Principles of Organizational Behavior: Indispensable Knowledge for Evidence‐Based Management, Second Edition</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This chapter focuses on using the concepts of ability, benevolence, and integrity as a means of increasing trust. Ability, benevolence, and integrity are the most critical facets of trustworthiness. They foster a sense of trust in the leader by followers. Ability reflects the knowledge, skills, and aptitudes of a leader, in both technical areas and general management competencies. Benevolence and integrity are aspects of the leader&rsquo;s character, and require more time and attention on the part of followers before they can be reliably judged. In order to increase trust, leaders need to take steps to increase their ability, build their benevolence, and demonstrate their integrity. Leaders can do so on a follower‐by‐follower basis, but can also take steps to create a culture of trustworthiness within their organizations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Breaking down concepts like “trust”—which seem innately understood and obvious—into component parts can be very powerful. It gives you a way “in” when it comes to solving problems dependent on that concept.</p>

			 <p>I have been slowly teaching myself <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo</a> tonight. I haven&rsquo;t gotten to the fun part yet, I guess. Due to incompatibilities with themes and, in the case of my first install, with the location where I want to store my site files, I had to install Hugo (on my Linux server) four different times now: via snap, apt, the &ldquo;hugo” .deb package, and finally the “hugo extended&rdquo; .dev package. I am finally at the point where I may have found a theme that is suitable for my personal site landing page.</p>
<p>Hugo is not my first static site generator. I actually landed on a less-known one called <a href="http://laktek.github.io/punch/">Punch</a> a long time ago. It is not longer being developed, so I don&rsquo;t want to use it any more. It was very simple to use, though, in a way that Hugo does not seem to be. I think that once I get the hang of Hugo I will love it though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boston Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia, who hasn&rsquo;t played since 2019 because of a knee injury suffered two seasons earlier, announced his retirement Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could it have ended better and I finished my career the right way? Yeah of course,&rdquo; Pedroia said on a Zoom call with the media. &ldquo;But there was a reason I was the first one dressed at 5:30 for a 7 o&rsquo;clock game. I always tell my teammates that you never know if the game is going to start early. My biggest thing in my mind was that this could be my last game and you don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s the best way I approached it from Little League on. I had the best time playing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a Red Sox fan, Pedroia’s retirement is no surprise. He hasn’t been physically able to play for years, since he got injured by a Manny Machado slide at second base. It is sad nonetheless. In his prime, he was fun and exciting to watch, and embodied the quality I enjoy seeing the most as a fan: “the love of the game.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The contention that social media as an industry censors conservatives is now, as we speak, becoming part of an even broader disinformation campaign from the right, that conservatives are being silenced all across American society,” the report’s lead researcher Paul Barrett said in an interview with The Verge. “This is the obvious post-Trump theme, we’re seeing it on Fox News, hearing it from Trump lieutenants, and I think it will continue indefinitely. Rather than any of this going away with Trump leaving Washington, it’s only getting more intense.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of those studies that <em>may</em> help future historians sort through the mess we are living through now. It is pretty obvious to me that there is a conservative bias on social media rather than a liberal one. The shocking election in 2016 of a mendacious “conservative” social media gasbag is enough proof. That he wasn’t deplatformed until he lost the 2020 election, despite sowing devision and inciting violence on social media platforms, is further proof of it.</p>
<p>I bristle now at hearing or seeing the word “conservative” describe the people running a disinformation campaign against their fellow citizens. There’s nothing “conservative” about this influential and dangerous wing of the Republican Party, which is undermining the basic traditions and institutions of society. I identify strongly as a political progressive, but I am also quite conservative in how I think that people should behave publicly and how ethically and transparently political institutions should be run.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>While I have been working a ton lately, I can’t work every second of the day. I have been watching the “Fullmetal Alchemist” anime series (there are two), mostly late at night, to unwind.</p>
<p>I watched the entirety of “Fullmetal Alchemist”—which is the first anime adaptation of the manga—first. Because it veers widely off of the plot of the manga (which, since I am not a manga reader, I don’t care about), it seems to be widely considered the lesser of the two adaptations. I think that sells it short. There are lots of sad, thought-provoking episodes, especially toward the beginning of the run, in which characters and the audience question what it means to be human, and what is the value of a human soul. These questions build up to big ideas and set pieces by the end, which is satisfying. There are some structural problems with how the story is told—mostly in the way the timeline, pacing, and character balance shift between the beginning, middle, and end of the series—but there is no problem that majorly detracts from the series as a whole. You could quibble that a lot of the theory behind how the magic system works doesn’t make any sense, which is vital to the overall theme of the series. Consider, however, that it is a <em>magic system</em>, you have to suspend disbelief quite a bit to begin with, and of course it doesn’t make perfect sense.</p>
<p>I am almost done watching the second adaptation, “Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood”, which stays true to the manga plot and is generally lauded as the better of the two anime series. At this point, I don’t think of it as “better” but it certainly is much different. The stakes in “Brotherhood” are much higher, the characters are more tightly integrated throughout the series, and the tone overall is funnier and less sad, despite the raised stakes and some (somewhat) more mature relationship elements between childhood friends/teenage-phenoms Edward and Winry. Despite these advantages, “Brotherhood” is far more cartoony in style, which I don’t prefer. It uses <em>chibi</em> (super deformed) style far more heavily than the first adaptation did, which I find distracting—the characters are often blowing their stacks in anger or are extremely embarrassed or go into some of other extreme, but emotionally and visually, that takes me out of the story a bit. That is a relatively small demerit, however, and it is offset by the increased complexity of the story.</p>
<p>I am eager to see how “Brotherhood” ends, and would recommend that everyone try watching both series, especially the first one, because it is very good despite being the less-loved one.</p>

			 <p>My wife and I recently discovered the Apple TV+ show “<a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/little-voice/umc.cmc.4x932osv992wjjdq7ce12za2r">Little Voice</a>” and very much enjoy it.</p>
<p>It is different in pace and tone from other shows (like “Curb Your Enthusiasm”) that we have been watching lately. While there is a lot going on in each episode, the pace feels slow and thoughtful, as if the show is focused mainly on the growth of its characters and on illustrating (a version of) the New York City music scene. I would not recommend watching “Little Voice” for its main plot, because it appears to follow the well-worn path of “talented-but-unknown artist slowly becomes successful.” That said, there are a ton of great character moments throughout.</p>
<p>The main draw of the show is the music, most of which are songs written by series co-creator Sara Bareilles. There is a lot of music performance in each episode. All these sections look great, sound great, and are integrated completely naturally into the story. However, they serve as the primary reason why the pace is slow. If you don’t like the music, then the show will not be for you.</p>
<p>Overall, I think that “Little Voice” is under-rated. It didn’t blow up like “Ted Lasso” (which is, indeed, great) or “Central Park” (which is also great), but is my third-favorite Apple TV+ series thus far.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Marques Brownlee could be described as “tech reviewer” or a “social media influencer” or a “YouTuber.” I don’t watch all his videos, but I have checked in with his YouTube channel periodically since I first saw him (as a college student!) on an episode of TWiT. While he is telegenic and charismatic, he also presents himself as someone with a strong sense of ethics who is very smart and thoughtful about he approaches his business. This interview gives a pretty long look into Marques Brownlee’s professional world.</p>
<p>My wife, who is a high school teacher, recently reported to me that one of the top “professions” that teens want to go into is “social media influencer.” That is kind of eyeroll-inducing to me, but I suppose it is as realistic and as meaningful an aspiration as “famous writer” was to me. It is important to know how much work goes into that sort of job, and how much time, investment, and infrastructure goes into keeping up with the competition.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://kottke.org/21/01/the-covid-19-vaccines-are-amazing-lets-quickly-get-them-into-peoples-arms">Jason Kottke’s blog post</a> offers some great advice that we all should heed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what can you do about this right now? 1. Stop worrying about the variants until the experts let us know we have something to worry about. 2. If you are eligible for the vaccine, get it! 3. Spread the word about vaccine availability in your area. Yesterday Vermont opened signups for vaccination appointments for all Vermonters 75 and older, and I texted/emailed everyone I could think of who was over 75 or who had parents/relatives/friends who are over 75 to urge them to sign up or spread the word. 4. Continue to wear a mask (a better one if possible), wash your hands, social distance, stay home when possible, don’t spend time indoors w/ strangers, etc. Thanks to these remarkable vaccines, real relief is in sight — let’s keep on track and see this thing through.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My family is now obsessed with wearing two layers of masks, which I tried but couldn’t get to work with my glasses on. I am more interested in finally being able to buy and wear N95, KN95, and KN94 (my favorite) masks, which are more effective than the cloth masks and surgical masks I have been stuck with since February.</p>
<p>In New Jersey, vaccine distribution is both successful (my wife, who is a teacher, got her first dose yesterday) and a total mess (it is very hard to get an appointment, there is no central coordination of virus distribution, and any effective effort on prioritizing inoculations for higher-risk groups is effective gone). If my family is a good indicator of people’s behavior, then lots of us New Jerseyans keep hammering away at the appointment systems, trying to get a better appointment slot, which further jams up the system.</p>

			 <p>After dithering on it for several weeks, I finally ordered a blue iPhone 12 mini late Friday night. I plan to keep it for the next four years, and also plan to keep using my iPhone 7 Plus as an occasional video player/video game player around the house.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be delivered here on Tuesday, but it came late this morning—a couple days early. Strangely, I find myself not ready for it! I have too many things to do today, and will have to wait to open up my new toy until after the kids go to bed.￼</p>

			 <p>I spent about two hours last night trying to figure out if I can move my FreeNAS server, which constantly generates about 40 dB of fan noise white noise in my home office, to the basement, so that I can escape the noise. The problem I have is that there is nowhere else in my house where I can get a wired connection. I tried a wireless-to-ethernet bridging solution, and was super disappointed with how slow it was (40 mbps up/down).</p>
<p><em>Then</em> I thought about scrapping the FreeNAS server, because I don&rsquo;t need such a robust platform for my backups. I started looking into buying a Synology or something and loading it with larger hard drives so I don&rsquo;t lose capacity.</p>
<p>While I was doing that, I started moving files off my FreeNAS server to prepare for retiring it. Of course, in doing so, I fell in love with the dang thing all over again, because I released how many services I am running and how flexible and reliable it is. I would like to get rid of the fan noise, though, but if I do, I will then be bothered by the 25 dB of fan noise from my work laptop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Right when the lockdown happened in March, we were a week away from shooting. So the last time I was in a room with a lot of people was the table read episodes one and two of season three, and we were ready to go. Then it all got shut down. Season three is completely written, ready to go, and then during this time we actually went and wrote season four. So we have both of those kinda done. We’re just waiting until we can start shooting again.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Barry” is a _ sui generis_ example of peak TV. It takes a lot of risks in terms of both plot and tone, and so far they have all paid off. I certainly couldn’t predict how Bill Hader and Alex Berg were going to write their way out of the end of Season 2 of “Barry,” but I guess they cracked it and then some.</p>

			 <p>I was having a pretty good day yesterday, full of minor but meaningful personal and professional accomplishments, and then all hell broke loose in Washington, DC. I pushed the news of it away as best I could, so I am less informed than I otherwise would be, but I am sad, angry, and ashamed nonetheless.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-rioters-incite/2021/01/06/0acfc778-5035-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html">Per Philip Rucker in <em>The Washington Post</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “American carnage” that Donald Trump vowed to end at the dawn of his presidency was revived in terrifying, treacherous form at its sunset Wednesday, as Trump made a fiery last stand and incited his supporters to storm and sack the U.S. Capitol as part of an attempted coup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t even know how to comment on this event without seeming glib, but I feel compelled to say something anyway.</p>
<p>I am, by trade, an auditor. One thing auditors are trained to investigate is called “tone at the top,” which represents the values expressed by the top management of a company which are expected from everyone who reports up to them.</p>
<p>After auditing for years, I have discovered that “tone at the top” is almost everything you need to know about an organization to get an idea how well and how ethically it is operated. Ethics and decency from the top of an organization really do trickle down all the way to the bottom and permeate it entirely. Moreover, they are strongly indicative of the organization’s <em>solvency</em>—its ability to hold together as a going concern over time.</p>
<p>When the “tone at the top” is selfish, vain, petty, petulant, aggrieved, unethical, amoral, and violent—as Trump’s has been—that tone trickles down to the whole organization, and pollutes the thoughts and corrupts the actions of the people within it. Unfortunately in this case, the “organization” is not just the Executive Branch, not just the federal government, and not just the Republican Party: it is the entire United States of America. What’s more, because the U.S. is a vastly influential country, the corruption and willful deceit at the head of it spills over into the rest of the world.</p>
<p>I feel like I have known this from the beginning—before the slow-moving coup even started—because I understood what the “tone at the top” was, and knew that it was vitally important. <em>Knowing</em> this, sadly, is not enough, because in a democracy a majority of people need to know this for things to turn out better. Being <em>able</em> to know this, like being able to discern the “tone at the top” as a new auditor, is a rare gift. It requires a trait that is not easily acquired, but is so difficult to teach and to learn that it is often considered to be innate: <em>shrewdness</em>.</p>
<p>That’s because “tone at the top” isn’t always as blatantly obvious as Trump’s vitriolic tweets and shambolic rally speeches. Understanding what the “tone at the top” <em>really</em> is, it requires a combination of healthy skepticism, decent powers of observation, and the knowledge of how things are supposed to work. You have to understand both context <em>and</em> subtext; subtext is much harder to grasp than context, but is often the more important to the two. You have to interpret people’s words <em>and</em> actions, and compare them to each other to see if the actions follow the words. You also have to have some kind of ethical foundation—which may be laws of the state, societal norms, or virtue ethics— on which to base your conclusions.</p>
<p>The human mind has evolved to do a lot of this analysis automatically. Consider that establishing whether you trust another person is, and always has been, an essential part of human interaction. But, like a lot of thought processes that are largely automatic, many times mental shortcuts are taken and the wrong choice is made. To be able to second-guess these automatic thought processes takes intellect, some degree of guidance, and a willingness to think a little harder.</p>
<p>I would not be surprised to learn that many of the people trying to unlawfully overturn the election—not counting the elected officials who are operating out of cynical self-interest—really do think they are making an ethical decision, and really do think they are doing the right thing. They just trusted the wrong person, or made the wrong decision about voting for or supporting, because they lack the shrewdness and imagination to discern that the “tone at the top” really does matter, and that bad words from a lazy president really will lead to riots in the streets.</p>

			 <p>I got a chance to play a few hours of <a href="https://www.orithegame.com"><em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em></a> over the past couple days, and think it is absolutely amazing. While it definitely rehashes some of the same scenarios and story beats from the first game, the <em>gameplay</em> is actually significantly more complex and rewarding. I think I&rsquo;m benefiting from my experience with the first game, which I played through twice, but I have found the sequel to be a little more forgiving in its difficulty.</p>
<p>In general, it is wonderful to have some fun video games to retreat to in this very stressful pandemic time. I do recognize that I need to turn away from gaming a little bit more than I have been, and move back to more productive activities in my &ldquo;free time.&rdquo; Games like <em>Ori</em> make that just a little bit harder.</p>

This year, I found some Christmas music I actually like (the &ldquo;Jazz Christmas&rdquo; playlist on Apple Music, plus &ldquo;Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas&rdquo; and Nat King Cole’s &ldquo;Christmas Music.”), and plan to bake cookies and host a family dinner this evening.

It is based on a three-book series, so three seasons of TV adaption makes perfect sense. I hope that more book-to-one-season-of-television adaptations are made going forward, because it offers more time to tell the story than a 2-hour movie, but not <em>too much</em> time, like an open-ended TV series adaptation would.</p>
<p>While it is not my <em>favorite</em> show on TV right now, it is up there. I think the cast is fantastic and the cinematography and visual effects look great. <em>The Amber Spyglass</em>, book three of the series, is my least favorite, and I have no idea how parts of it could be visualized the the screen, but I don&rsquo;t have any doubts that &ldquo;His Dark Materials&rdquo; will do a really good job with it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m OK with this. I loved Season 1 of &ldquo;Ted Lasso&rdquo; but I think the premise will completely wear out its welcome by episode 30. Limited series are good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Enola Holmes case hinged on Sherlock Holmes’ complicated copyright status. Most Holmes stories sit in the public domain, and stories like Enola Holmes — which reimagines Holmes (played by Henry Cavill) having a younger sister — can freely repurpose their elements. But 10 of Arthur Conan Doyle’s stories are still protected by copyright, and the Doyle estate argued that they depict a meaningfully different version of the character. (He’s more caring, less overtly contemptuous of women and friendship, and generally less of a jerk.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe Arthur Conan Doyle&rsquo;s estate should have <em>any</em> rights over Sherlock Holmes at all. Conan Doyle died in 1930. It&rsquo;s completely outrageous.</p>

<p>The show, <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em>, was not included as an announcement during Disney’s big investor day last week.

<p>I can’t help but think that Disney may be planning to give fans <em>too much</em> of a good thing. The whole kerfuffle about <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3778644/">Solo</a> flopping, due to exhausted audience interest, which led to the scuttling of the <em>Star Wars</em> side story movie series, is only about two years old.

<p>When earmarks were a regular feature of congressional business, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said Democrats and Republicans were able to cut more deals and pass more bills with bipartisan support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds like a bad idea at first, but it probably is actually a good one. Congress can&rsquo;t pass meaningful legislation anymore, in part because there is almost no bipartisan agreement on important bills. Maybe allowing earmarks will make it easier to gain votes &ldquo;across the aisle&rdquo;—you know, like it used to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By moving into the premium headphones space, Apple will directly compete with brands like Bose, Sony, Sennheiser, AKG, Bowers and Wilkins, and others that have years of experience and a long list of products between them. Apple is going higher than just about all of them on price, but the company is riding the momentum of the AirPods and AirPods Pro, which have dominated the true wireless earbuds market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that Apple&rsquo;s headphones cost more than any in my collection—and I have some pretty impressive headphones.</p>
<p>The headband design looks a little odd at the top. I hope the engineers sacrificed looks for comfort there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a shame they charge via Lightning</p>

<p>We are squarely in the farce phase.

			 <p>Wajahat Ali, writing an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/opinion/trump-supporters.html">op-ed in the New York Times</a>, has given up on Trump supporters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We cannot help people who refuse to help themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I get it. It was shocking that Trump actually gained in the vote count after four years of doing everything he could to diminish American standing and influence in the world, and the rights and lives of people within his own borders. It is worse to have lived through an era in which the Republican Party went from a political movement with some bad ideas about taxation and social services to a full-on fascist personality cult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to blame Trump. He <em>is</em> a problem. But he is not the only problem. Ali hits at this deep into the article (my emphasis added in bold), stating something that is vital to understanding the predicament we are in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trump is an extension of their id, their culture, their values, their greed. He is <strong>their</strong> defender and savior. He is <strong>their</strong> blunt instrument. He is <strong>their</strong> destructive drug of choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thing we should not forget about the Trump supporters is that <em>they empower him</em>—it&rsquo;s not the other way around. If Trump is a lightning rod, his supporters are the lightning.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t turn your back on those people because they are still here and are not going anywhere. Changing their minds might be a generation&rsquo;s worth of work, but it is work that has to be done because social institutions are breaking down, and not by accident. The Republican Party transformed itself over the past fifty years into what it is now, through planning, determination, and lots and lots of money. There is no reason that the Democratic Party can&rsquo;t do the same. It takes a lot of things, but most of all <em>will</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Epic Games and Spotify, united in their fight against Apple, each released statements on Wednesday slamming the iPhone maker following news of its new App Store fee reduction for developers making less than $1 million per year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>File this under &ldquo;some people are never happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t <em>love</em> all of Apple&rsquo;s policies—for example, it is ridiculous that developers have to <em>opt in</em> to the small business program—I believe that, as the owner of their platform (which is not even the <em>majority</em> platform),  they do have the right to make and enforce whatever rules they choose.</p>
<p>I found this statistic (emphasis added) in the article very interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cut should apply to an <strong>estimated 98 percent of iOS app developers that generated just 5 percent of the App Store’s revenue</strong> last year, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is a long, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail">long tail</a>. It really makes me think about how insignificant most app developers are to Apple.</p>

			 <p>I very much enjoyed <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-rise-and-fall-of-getting-things-done">Cal Newport&rsquo;s rumination on Getting Things Done</a> (GTD), and Merlyn Mann&rsquo;s contributions to personal productivity culture, in The New Yorker.</p>
<p>Finding <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com">Getting Things Done</a>, through Merlyn Mann&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.43folders.com">43 Folders</a>, was transformative for me. It supercharged my productivity, for a while at least, numerous times in my life.</p>
<p>GTD techniques and processes have not fixed the root problems with knowledge work, which Newport points out in the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this context, the shortcomings of personal-productivity systems like G.T.D. become clear. They don’t directly address the fundamental problem: the insidiously haphazard way that work unfolds at the organizational level. They only help individuals cope with its effects. A highly optimized implementation of G.T.D. might have helped Mann organize the hundreds of tasks that arrived haphazardly in his in-box daily, but it could do nothing to reduce the quantity of these requests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have a workaholic culture that puts a lot of pressure on the individual worker to be responsible for many, many things that are outside the worker&rsquo;s control. GTD is both a means of dealing with this pressure, and a personal methodology that prolongs one&rsquo;s exposure to all this pressure. It increases the number of balls you can keep in the air, but doesn&rsquo;t address the problem that others keep throwing more and more balls at you that they expect you to juggle.</p>

<p>This is the best news I&rsquo;ve heard about the pandemic in quite some time, and it seems legit this time. (I may be biased in favor of Pfizer, though.) We are all hopeful that a safe and effective vaccine will be found, and distributed widely and equitably, as soon as possible.</p>

			 <p>News outlets started calling the presidential race for Joe Biden this morning. In no sense should it have been a close call. It is deeply embarrassing. I consider the USA a failed state in the midst of a slow moving fascist coup that began with Nixon, found its footing with Reagan, and found its most effective bomb-thrower and wrecking ball (because he is the most shameless) in Trump. I am not sure reform is possible at this point, but if it is (and I hope it is), it will take a long, long time.</p>

			 <p>The always interesting Raspberry Pi Foundation has <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-400-the-70-desktop-pc/">announced a new &ldquo;desktop PC&rdquo; form factor that integrates its latest board into a keyboard</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve never been shy about borrowing a good idea. Which brings us to Raspberry Pi 400: it’s a faster, cooler 4GB Raspberry Pi 4, integrated into a compact keyboard. Priced at just $70 for the computer on its own, or $100 for a ready-to-go kit, if you’re looking for an affordable PC for day-to-day use this is the Raspberry Pi for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the keyboard is decent enough for you, and your computing needs are pretty basic, this is fantastic deal.</p>
<p>My favorite part of the new design is that all the ports are on one side. My biggest beef with the Raspberry Pi (I own 3 of them!) is that the ports are on all four sides, and I always need to plug cables into two or three of them, which makes for a mess of wires surrounding a nice, small box.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The surprise Nintendo Direct at the end of October ended with another glimpse at Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity that shows off how the Breath of the Wild prequel will let you control the powerful Divine Beasts from the open-world Legend of Zelda game. It also noted that the hack-and-slash game has a playable demo that fans can download via the Nintendo Switch eShop now, and it includes the entirety of the first chapter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy about this development. I love &ldquo;Breath of the Wild&rdquo; and would love to experience more world-building related to it, but I have never played a &ldquo;Dynasty Warriors&rdquo;-type game and have no idea if I would like it.</p>

			 <p>🎵 A <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/letter-to-you/1529959055">new Bruce Springsteen album</a> is always welcome. I can&rsquo;t get over how he keeps putting out good music. One thing I learned about him, from an alumni event (long ago) with his onetime producer, Jon Landau, is that Springsteen was not able to write dozens and dozens of songs and pick the best for his albums. He wrote relatively small numbers of good (and sometimes great) songs. That makes it all the more impressive to me that he has been releasing new material so regularly, and the quality is still high.</p>

<p>Maine Business Daily is part of a fast-growing network of nearly 1,300 websites that aim to fill a void left by vanishing local newspapers across the country. Yet the network, now in all 50 states, is built not on traditional journalism but on propaganda ordered up by dozens of conservative think tanks, political operatives, corporate executives and public-relations professionals, a Times investigation found.</p>

<p>This article serves as yet another example of the extent and level of organization of the American radical right&rsquo;s propaganda and disinformation machine.

			 <p><a href="https://www.nj.com/news/2020/10/postal-worker-in-nj-faces-charges-for-dumping-bundles-of-mail-including-nearly-100-election-ballots.html">From NJ.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A U.S. Postal Service mail carrier has been charged by federal authorities for allegedly discarding bundles of mail, including 99 general election ballots that were supposed to be delivered to Essex County residents, the U.S. Attorney’s Office announced Wednesday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like election fraud is happening just as Trump/Pence want it to. As a NJ voter, my confidence in the election process has taken a hit, and it is not because liberal, illegal immigrants are voting multiple times for the Democrats. 🙄 I now plan to drive my mail-in ballot to wherever the drop box is for my town.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://upgames.dev/">Up Spell</a> looks pretty fun, but, in my opinion, most of these &ldquo;spell as many words as you can&rdquo; games fall down because of too many nonsense words in the lexicon. Up Spell&rsquo;s <em>whole thing</em> is that just about everything is in its lexicon. The game&rsquo;s <a href="https://upgames.dev/up-spell-en-lexicon-2-letter-words.txt">2-letter word lexicon</a> doesn&rsquo;t fill me with hope that I will enjoy it. Maybe there will be a 3-letters-and-up mode in a future update for grumps like me.</p>

<p>I had a Rubik&rsquo;s Cube as a child, and never solved it. At one point, I remember having solved it except for two squares, and I peeled the stickers off and swapped them. (That was sort of my &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gord&hellip;</a>&rdquo; moment, I guess. 😂)</p>
<p>At this point, I don&rsquo;t care if I ever do solve it on my own (there are guides to solving it that I might decide to follow), but it will likely be fun to play with while I&rsquo;m on conference calls or watching TV. Hopefully it will be an object of fascination for my kids, too, and I will get them their own to play with.</p>

I beat the game (which is, basically, completing only about a third of the objectives) and have enjoyed, somewhat, the post-game experience. I have concluded, though, that I am terrible at Mario games. Lots of the platforming sections are frustrating for me, maybe because I didn&rsquo;t grow up with 3D gaming and can&rsquo;t get used to the perspective.  Perhaps the Zelda &ldquo;Hyrule Warriors&rdquo; sequel would be more my speed.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/8/19/21364031/coronavirus-air-purifiers-filter-hepa-merv-ventilation">Brian Resnick&rsquo;s article on Vox</a> summarizes some of the issues we are all facing in the back-to-school period. Coronavirus is in the air, and being indoors with an infected person for a prolonged time increases the viral load that one is exposed to. This is critical to understand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Derek Thompson observes in the Atlantic, a lot of places have put on a big show about cleaning surfaces — what he calls “hygiene theater” — though surface contamination is not thought to be a large source of Covid-19 transmission.</p>
<p>Making places safer, instead, should mean improving air quality. But “have you ever heard a restaurant reopening announce they’ve improved ventilation or increased ventilation?” Lidia Morawska, an engineer and the director of the International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health at Queensland University of Technology, recently told me. “No.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;hygiene theater&rdquo; of surface cleaning is already entrenched in mask wearing. Mask wearing is critical to reducing disease transmission from a public health perspective, but masks aren&rsquo;t magical COVID-19 blockers, especially when people are wearing them around their chins or taking them off before they sneeze (seriously, I have seen this in the grocery store). I think that a lot of people believe lots of activities, like sitting in a classroom all day, are OK as long as everyone wears masks, at least most of the time. I don&rsquo;t believe that—at least not at a time in which Covid cases are climbing, and outbreaks have been traced to gatherings of people indoors or families sharing a home.</p>
<p>I am concerned that in schools, restaurants, and other public places, &ldquo;ventilation theater&rdquo; will soon run rampant. We will be promised that &ldquo;ventilation system improvements&rdquo; will protect us, our children, and our grandparents, even when most buildings can&rsquo;t be redesigned to  circulate or scrub the air with any real effectiveness. The article points this out, too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember: Hygiene theater is possible when it comes to air quality as well. If a school or any indoor space says it has improved ventilation, ask how. Marr suggests asking building operators what the air exchange rate is (if they don’t know it, maybe be wary about the space). Ask about what filters have been put in place. Ask if their HVAC systems have been routinely maintained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do wonder when things will go back to pre-Covid normal. I am advocating opening windows and using window fans to exchange inside- and outside air, to the extent that is possible, in public buildings. Most places I can think of aren&rsquo;t really designed for that, unfortunately.</p>

			 <p>I noticed something strange on the latest iPadOS developer beta. The Fn key on my Apple Magic Keyboard (the old Bluetooth one, not the expensive new iPadPro peripheral) now has two new functions that kind of conflict with each other.</p>
<p>First, Fn-Backspace finally works as &ldquo;forward delete&rdquo; as it always has on the Mac. (That not being supported on iOS has long been a source of occasional frustration for me.)</p>
<p>Second, Fn, by itself, calls up the emoji picker, which used to be only called by Control-Command-Space.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, using Fn-Backspace calls up the emoji picker, which means I have to dismiss it (via Esc) if I want to forward delete. That does not save a keystroke, and makes &ldquo;forward delete&rdquo; not worth it.</p>

I signed up for <a href="https://nextdns.io">NextDNS</a> instead, and so far I&rsquo;m really happy with it. It blocks malware; it blocks adult content; it blocks ads. Unlike the pi-hole, it can be used away from my home network, too. I have set up different profiles for everyone in my family, and switched everyone&rsquo;s devices to use it today. The funny thing is, my wife hasn&rsquo;t noticed yet that ads are being blocked on her phone or computer.

I was not sure why I could not charge my laptop through the dock, until I noticed the distinction between USB-C and Thunderbolt, and I was not sure why my Thunderbolt-to-DisplayPort cable would not work from a USB-C port in the dock.

			 <p>We are getting a ton of tall, wobbly pine trees taken down in our backyard today, because they are at risk of falling, and tend to lose boughs whenever there is a windstorm. It is a bit traumatic—the noise, especially—but it will be nice to not have to worry about falling boughs and trees. I guess we&rsquo;re going to see a lot more of the sky and of our neighbors than we are used to. 😀</p>

Apple News feels like a junk drawer full of some news content plus a bunch of headlines that are really ads, because they lead to listicles full of affiliate links. Ironically, Google News—from a company that makes most of its money selling ads—seems less ad-filled and spammy to me.</p>

			 <p>I code in C# at work and in Swift in my home life. Each language has a default <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style">indentation style</a>, different mostly on whether opening curly braces (&quot;{&quot;) are placed at the end of a line or at the beginning of a line of their own. The former style is called the &ldquo;K&amp;R&rdquo; style, though I know it only as &ldquo;the one true brace style.&rdquo; The other style is called the &ldquo;Allman style,&rdquo; though I have never heard it called any name in particular, and think of it, myself, as &ldquo;C# style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I leave my IDE code formatting defaults alone, so I have coded using the &ldquo;one true style&rdquo; in Xcode for Swift, and have coded using the C# style in Visual Studio. Both styles seem to work equally as well, but overall I prefer the way that the C# style helps ensure that all the opening and closing braces will line up.</p>
<p>I have been thinking this week to try to change my Swift coding style to match my C# coding style, but I can&rsquo;t bring myself to do it. I can&rsquo;t imagine using the C# style for Swift coding, or the &ldquo;one true style&rdquo; for C# coding; it just wouldn&rsquo;t look or feel right. I found out that a lot of this stylistic distinction is based, as so much is, on historical precedent: influential textbooks or famous programmers set the way, and the rest of us follow. Maybe I will break with convention on my next Swift project, but probably not.</p>

			 <p>Tonight I&rsquo;m taking a trip down memory lane with 10,000 Maniacs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/mtv-unplugged-10-000-maniacs/322123519">MTV Unplugged</a>” was a huge hit from 1993, when I was a sophomore in high school. Back then, I listened to ”<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/in-my-tribe/251007463">In My Tribe</a>” and “<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/our-time-in-eden/321977519">Our Time In Eden</a>” (my favorite 10,000 Maniacs record) back-to-back all the time.</p>
<p><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/halloween-live-at-disney-institute-october-1998/1513187927">Another live performance, from 1998</a>, was just released a couple days ago, too.</p>

			 <p>The credit card companies have trained me very well to be really, really concerned about my credit score at all times. I check my credit score about once per week, even though it has always been in the “excellent” range and I have no real reason to check it. I have no reason to care about my credit score (I guess I am fortunate in that way) but I obsess about it nonetheless. It has been drilled into me that it is what responsible, ethical people do. I have internalized that logic as “it’s what <em>people like me</em> do.”</p>
<p>I think about China’s “<em>social</em> credit score” being implemented here in the United States somehow, what with the rise of authoritarianism and all, and marvel at how easy it would be to implement, and how much of it is already in place.</p>

<p>One of my favorite shows right now is Brooklyn Nine-Nine. It&rsquo;s characters, while being funny, eccentric, and often immature, are all portrayed as valorous and extremely dedicated to their jobs and to justice in general. That is part of its appeal to me. I don&rsquo;t see it as pro-cop propaganda, but it <em>does</em> work that way just a little bit, by presenting the world we wish was true, and allowing us to live in it for a while, as if it were true.</p>

			 <p>I wrote an AutoHotKey function today to paste decoded URL-encoded strings, which I have to do quite a lot because I&rsquo;m emailing people about files stored on SharePoint quite often now. It is useful to be able to paste a folder name or a file name without &ldquo;%20&rdquo; in the place of every space, and other URL-encoding garbage.</p>
<p>I like AutoHotKey well enough, but I wish it didn&rsquo;t have its own programming language. I&rsquo;d rather just use AutoHotKey to set hotkeys, and call out to  something else (C#, Python, Swift, JavaScript, even VB Script) for the functionality. I suppose that is <em>also</em> possible with AutoHotKey. Or, I could write my own Windows app to do that, somehow. But if I did that, I might have to implement my own programming language to support its scripting. 😅</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.arqbackup.com/blog/arq-6-more-power-more-security-more-storage-savings/">Arq Backup 6 was just released</a>. It is really compelling software if you want to &ldquo;roll your own&rdquo; backup service, rather than use something tightly integrated with the back-end, like BackBlaze. I&rsquo;m very glad, now, that I bought a lifetime license when Arq Backup 5 came out, four years ago. I got a free (as in, already paid for) upgrade! Arq Backup 6 is much simpler looking than prior versions were. It is set up almost like a web app. Unfortunately, it no longer looks and feels much like a Mac app, which is one of the things that brought me to it in the first place. I don&rsquo;t use its main UI that much anyway, though, so that probably is not a big deal.</p>

To my surprise, a lot of the games just felt old and not nearly as engaging as I remember them—even stone-cold classics like &ldquo;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&rdquo; and &ldquo;Super Metroid&rdquo;. When I look for a 2D game fix, I always end up playing newer games, like &ldquo;Hollow Knight,&rdquo; rather than playing the older games that I did legitimately love when I was a kid. I wonder if my kids will ever want to play those classic games, or if they will just skip them all because they aren&rsquo;t worthwhile compared to more recent games.</p>

			 <p>Uh-oh. Apple Photos started saying my full-resolution photos will no longer fit on my Mac. I have 80 GB free on a 500 GB SSD, but Photos is still complaining. I&rsquo;m debating what to do about it. A huge part of my backup strategy is using Arq backup to back up my full-resolution photos (the entire library, really) to Backblaze B2. Maybe I will export all my photos (the originals) and copy them to B2, then turn on “Optimize Storage”, and then stop trying to back up my originals on my Mac. I&rsquo;m not getting a new Mac with a 1 TB SSD in it anytime soon, unfortunately. What a pain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Executive leadership changes happen at major companies all the time — but at Google, Naughton’s move is notable because she was a key figure responsible for dealing with an unprecedented level of internal employee turmoil and dissent. In recent years, Google workers feuded among themselves and with management over issues ranging from the company’s alleged mishandling of executive sexual harassment cases to its crackdown on employee speech in the workplace. Naughton is also the fourth long-tenured Google executive, including the company’s cofounders, to step down from an executive position or resign altogether in recent months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google&rsquo;s main internal problem, from my outside point-of-view, is that the things they are best at—software and services—are not really their business. They are just Google&rsquo;s bait. Their business is online advertising, and that business is at odds, in many respects, with quality software and user-focused services.</p>

			 <p>There is a lot of confusion surrounding election security, and how voting machines should work. Every tech pundit podcaster I listen to says that electronic voting machines must have a paper trail, so there is a backup if the software behind the voting system fails. That sounds reasonable.</p>
<p>The thing is, they all have it backward. The <em>original</em> vote should be on paper. The paper trail should be the actual votes cast, not the results recorded by voting machines. After all, if the software running the voting machines is improperly coded or compromised by malware, why would we trust the paper trail that same software creates?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are election experts that know far better than I do how to do it right. I just wish someone would call into question the assumption that a computerized machine is necessary to cast votes in the first place.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/01/the_ipad_awkwardly_turns_10">John Gruber does <em>not</em> like the iPad multitasking interface</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The iPad at 10 is, to me, a grave disappointment. Not because it’s “bad”, because it’s not bad — it’s great even — but because great though it is in so many ways, overall it has fallen so far short of the grand potential it showed on day one. To reach that potential, Apple needs to recognize they have made profound conceptual mistakes in the iPad user interface, mistakes that need to be scrapped and replaced, not polished and refined. I worry that iPadOS 13 suggests the opposite — that Apple is steering the iPad full speed ahead down a blind alley.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gruber is far from the only person decrying the software on the iPad on the 10th anniversary of its reveal, but I think the strength of these opinions has more to do with punditry than with actual problems with the iPad&rsquo;s usability. I would imagine that most iPad users don&rsquo;t use multitasking, don&rsquo;t want to use it, and don&rsquo;t trigger it by accident. Moreover, <em>multitasking can be turned off</em> in the Settings App (look for the switch for &ldquo;Allow Multiple Apps&rdquo;).</p>
<p>I think the iPad multitasking interface is fine. What I would hate is if Apple put a freeform, windowed interface on it, to make it more like the Mac. That would introduce far more fiddliness than I have the patience to deal with on a tablet.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://collider.com/rise-of-skywalker-worst-reviewed-star-wars-movie">Per Matt Golderberg at Collider</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, the final Rotten Tomatoes tally has come in, and it looks like The Rise of Skywalker is the worst-reviewed Star Wars movie ever, sitting at 52%, one percent lower than Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I actually enjoyed <em>Rise of Skywalker</em>. <em>The Last Jedi</em> was the film that ruined the Star Wars franchise for me—it wasn&rsquo;t really bad, like <em>The Phantom Menace</em>, but it both added and threw out so much of the <em>Star Wars</em> canon that it made the phone thing seem silly and unimportant.</p>
<p>Now that I have seen all all three &ldquo;sequel trilogy&rdquo; movies, the whole &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; franchise seems silly and unimportant. Creatively, the sequel trilogy was completely bankrupt, amounting mostly to remakes of the prior (good) films, and repeats and amplifications of prior plot points. I don&rsquo;t hate it now, though. I think of it as enjoyable cinematic fluff: entertaining diversions, like really high-budget B-movies. It just isn&rsquo;t <em>important</em> and it clearly doesn&rsquo;t make <em>any</em> sense. Accepting that, I can enjoy them when I want to escape to &ldquo;a time long ago, in a galaxy far away,&rdquo; and otherwise not think about them at all.</p>

		<a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2020/01/20/gotta-get-up.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-01-20 10:37:02 -0500">Jan 20, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I was thinking of &ldquo;<a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt7520794/">Russian Doll</a>&rdquo; and put on <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/gotta-get-up/304815001?i=304815004">&ldquo;Gotta Get Up&rdquo; by Harry Nillson</a>. Curious about the song, I looked it up on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotta_Get_Up">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2019, &ldquo;Gotta Get Up&rdquo; was prominently featured as the &ldquo;reset&rdquo; song in the Netflix series Russian Doll. The song plays each time the series’ protagonist Nadia (co-creator Natasha Lyonne) dies and returns to the same location – a bathroom at her 36th birthday party. Its use is similar to that of Sonny &amp; Cher&rsquo;s &ldquo;I Got You Babe&rdquo; from the 1993 film Groundhog Day.  Lyonne explained that in choosing the song she was struck by the &ldquo;buoyant doomsday quality&rdquo; of Nilsson&rsquo;s life. The cost of using the song so many times took up a significant portion of the music budget. His estate also limited how many times the song could be used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading this got me thinking about what nonsense music rights are for TV and movies. Why are song rights so expensive? Moreover, why should Nillson&rsquo;s estate be able to limit &ldquo;how many times the songs could be used? (Harry Nilsson died in 1994.) That sounds so frustrating to deal with. I don&rsquo;t understand why more TV producers don&rsquo;t just hire musicians to record cover versions and cut out, at the very least, the performance royalties. (I know this sometimes happens. I&rsquo;m surprised it doesn&rsquo;t happen more.)</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised, however. I liked it quite a bit. If this is mediocre TV, then much of what I have been watching the past couple years must be truly bad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today—as Joker receives 11 Oscar nominations, the most of any movie, including Best Picture and Best Director—is the day that someone must stand astride the tracks and say: Enough. Stop the madness. Joker is not the best picture of the year. Joker is dumb as hell.</p>

<p>The entire article is a fun-to-read tirade against the movie—it&rsquo;s the sort of contrarian opinion piece that <em>Slate</em> used to be renowned for.</p>
<p>Kois&rsquo;s flip-out reminds me of how I felt when the 2015 movie, &ldquo;Mad Max: Fury Road&rdquo; was nominated for Best Picture. That movie, and the world it depicts, doesn&rsquo;t make a lick of sense, but people still gush over it.</p>
<p>At this point in my life, I think the Oscars themselves are &ldquo;dumb as hell&rdquo; and are best ignored.</p>

			 <p>This album is probably known as one of R.E.M.&rsquo;s lesser efforts. When it came out in 2001, I didn&rsquo;t like it. Compared to R.E.M.&rsquo;s earlier work, it felt pat and drowsy. The mid-tempo arrangements lacked insistence and energy, and all the studio sound effects felt unnatural and unmusical to me at the time. I played it once and didn&rsquo;t listen to it any more.</p>
<p>A few years later, one of my friends said, offhandedly, after &ldquo;All the Way to Reno (Our&rsquo;s Gonna be a Star)&rdquo; came on the radio, that he absolutely loved the album. I got to hear it through new ears, and came to love how good it <em>sounds</em>, and to think of the songs as dark, late night, chill-out rock, whose arrangements and instrumentation move between spareness to lushness in interesting ways.</p>

			 <p>🎵 Today&rsquo;s album: <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/diatom-ribbons/1474418624">&ldquo;Diatom Ribbons&rdquo; by Kris Davis</a></p>
<p>Kris Davis is a jazz pianist, composer, and bandleader. The New York Times crowned &ldquo;<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/diatom-ribbons/1474418624">Diatom Ribbons</a>&rdquo; as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/arts/music/best-jazz.html">#1 jazz album of 2019</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kris Davis, 39, has spent years as her generation’s powerhouse pianist in waiting. No longer. On “Diatom Ribbons,” her skills as a composer, band assembler, system builder and improviser — a musical auteur, basically — come fully into focus. Ms. Davis builds her compositions on crooked patterns and splintered loops that somehow become a kind of magnetic touchstone, bringing together wildly diverse musicians in tangled unity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t listen to jazz that much anymore but I used to listen to it for hours on end as I read and wrote my way through my senior year of college. (It helped that I could get countless jazz CDs for free at the library.) &ldquo;Diatom Ribbons&rdquo; is more edgy and experimental than the classic jazz I grew up on, but I found it quite enjoyable. Listening to it is like visiting a musical world I kind of understand, and kind of don&rsquo;t, but feeling warm and welcome all the same.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/01/the-miseducation-of-the-american-boy/603046/">Peggy Orenstein&rsquo;s article in <em>The Atlantic</em></a> exploring the sorry state of musculinity, as experienced by the American teenager, is well written and worth reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feminism may have provided girls with a powerful alternative to conventional femininity, and a language with which to express the myriad problems-that-have-no-name, but there have been no credible equivalents for boys. Quite the contrary: The definition of masculinity seems to be in some respects contracting. When asked what traits society values most in boys, only 2 percent of male respondents in the PerryUndem survey said honesty and morality, and only 8 percent said leadership skills—traits that are, of course, admirable in anyone but have traditionally been considered masculine. When I asked my subjects, as I always did, what they liked about being a boy, most of them drew a blank. “Huh,” mused Josh, a college sophomore at Washington State. (All the teenagers I spoke with are identified by pseudonyms.) “That’s interesting. I never really thought about that. You hear a lot more about what is wrong with guys.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to make masculinity less toxic, we (men especially) have to define it in positive, attainable attributes. To be masculine <em>should</em> mean (1) to have self-discipline, (2) to take responsibility for your actions (even when you are wrong), and, most importantly, (3) to care for people (friends, family, community, and those who are vulnerable) with your words and actions. Masculinity should be about using your strength-both physical strength and, more importantly, inner strength-to preserve and protect people, society, and nature, as best you can. I don&rsquo;t think this is a new definition of masculinity, though. I think it is a very, very old one—one whose traits do not stand in contrast with femininity, but, instead, they overlap and support femininity—and feminism too.</p>

			 <p>It looks like <a href="https://www.freenas.org">FreeNAS</a> is, eventually, going to run on top of Debian Linux, not just FreeBSD. VP of Engineering Kris Moore <a href="https://www.ixsystems.com/community/threads/freenas-plans-2020-and-beyond.80462/">posted</a> today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] we’re going to be hard at work in 2020 to make our 12.0 code portable across multiple OS platforms. The middleware at the core of FreeNAS is already pretty portable today, and we want to start extending its reach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty cool. Good on them to unbolt their software from the underlying OS. I think it will give them a lot more flexibility going forward. I don&rsquo;t know if I will <em>run</em> FreeNAS on Linux anytime soon, though. I learned to adore BSD&rsquo;s stability and simplicity from running FreeNAS, but it has made it harder to virtualize and/or run some useful services on my hardware.</p>
<p>Kris Moore went on to clarify:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FreeNAS as it exists will continue on FreeBSD for 12.0 and beyond. This will be bringing some of the same software-base to Linux to unveil some new products that are Linux-based in the coming months. If you currently are happy with FreeNAS as it sits today, you can expect to keep updating it on BSD going forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of this sounds good to me. FreeNAS has been a great platform for me for many years now.</p>

			 <p>Social media is a scam. Who knew?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/06/technology/fake-social-media-manipulation.html">Davey Alba reports in the New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;The] report also brings renewed attention to an often overlooked vulnerability for internet platforms: companies that sell clicks, likes and comments on social media networks. Many of the companies are in Russia, according to the researchers. Because the social networks’ software ranks posts in part by the amount of engagement they generate, the paid activity can lead to more prominent positions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No kidding that engagement is fake. Paying for fake &ldquo;Likes&rdquo; is the same kind of thing as paying for fake clicks, which is a scam performed to goose online ad revenue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, a department at Oxford University, said easy social media manipulation could have implications for European elections this year and the 2020 presidential election in the United States.</p>
<p>“Fake engagement — whether generated by automated or real accounts — can skew the perceived popularity of a candidate or issue,” Ms. Bradshaw said. “If these strategies are used to amplify disinformation, conspiracy and intolerance, social media could exacerbate the polarization and distrust that exist within society.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, paying to amplify a message will, indeed, amplify it, even if that message is false or destructive to the fabric of society. It&rsquo;s too bad that social media is so addictive. It is cause <em>so many</em> problems.</p>

			 <p>Today I learned that the Beatles' &ldquo;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&rdquo; is widely reviled. From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ob-La-Di,_Ob-La-Da">Wikipedia article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&rdquo; is often the subject of ridicule. In 2004, it was included in Blender magazine&rsquo;s list titled &ldquo;50 Worst Songs Ever!&quot;[61] and was voted the worst song of all time in an online poll organised by Mars.[62] In 2012, the NME&rsquo;s website editor, Luke Lewis, argued that the Beatles had recorded &ldquo;a surprising amount of ropy old toss&rdquo;, and singled out &ldquo;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&rdquo; as &ldquo;the least convincing cod-reggae skanking this side of the QI theme tune&rdquo;. That same year, Tom Rowley of The Daily Telegraph said the track was a &ldquo;reasonable choice&rdquo; for derision, following the result of the Mars poll, and it subsequently came second (behind &ldquo;Revolution 9&rdquo;) in the Telegraph&rsquo;s poll to determine the worst Beatles song.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I always liked that song, and never thought of it as anything other than a light, fun song that is supposed to be—big shock here—light and fun. I&rsquo;m more apt to be critical of art that takes itself too seriously.</p>

			 <p>I have been eyeing the <a href="https://jdslabs.com/product/element-ii/">JDS Labs Element II</a> desktop DAC/amp for about a week now. It looks great (I <em>want</em> the huge volume knob), it has all the power I would ever need, and it has gotten some great reviews regarding its sound quality and the excellence of its amp. I have almost bought it twice, and have almost bought its cheaper, older sibling, the famous <a href="https://jdslabs.com/product/objective2-odac-rev-b/">Objective2+ODAC</a> once from JDS and once from its other US manufacturer, <a href="https://mayflowerelectronics.com/o2-odac-overview/">Mayflower Electronics</a>.</p>
<p>The main thing holding me back is that I already have a pretty great DAC/amp, the (discontinued) <a href="https://www.oppodigital.com/headphone-amplifier-ha-2SE/">Oppo HA-2se</a>. I want to upgrade to a desktop model mainly to have more sturdy piece of equipment at my (admittedly already crowded) desk. I have had problems with my Oppo sliding off my desk. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind higher quality DAC and amp, though I probably wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell if it is any &ldquo;better&rdquo; than what I already have. Lastly, I think I just love audio gear. I would love to test a bunch of it and have a few pieces I really like around the house so I can use them all the time.</p>
<p>I have to stay strong, though, and avoid spending more money on my audiophile hobby, because I think my current equipment is already delivering me as much quality as my somewhat damaged ears can discern.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I spent most of my workday listening to music today, and really enjoyed it. One album I revisited, thanks to a remaster and, basically, nostalgia, was <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/green-remastered/1440947724">&ldquo;Green&rdquo;</a> by R.E.M. Green was my first R.E.M. album, which I got when I was in middle school. (I don&rsquo;t remember how I learned about them. I know it wasn&rsquo;t from hearing &ldquo;Stand&rdquo;. It was probably from browsing &ldquo;Rolling Stone&rdquo; in a bookstore.)</p>
<p>Now, instead of reading liner notes while I listen to an album, I surf the web for album reviews to read instead. <a href="http://drownedinsound.com/releases/17638/reviews/4146397">The best &ldquo;Green&rdquo; review I found today</a> was by Andrezj Lukowski on Drowned in Sound:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Green is the end of something and the beginning of something else and the continuation of something greater, but rather than get lost in grand narratives, maybe let’s focus on what it sounds like.</p>
<p>For the most part, Green sounds like innocence, a sense of youth and light and simplicity and clumsiness and play that had not been in the band&rsquo;s makeup when they burst out of the Georgian murk with the Chronic Town and Murmur.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know what the changes the remaster did to the album. It may have just made everything louder. Whatever the improvements were, the album sounded great on my super nice headphones. Of course, when I was a kid, listening to &ldquo;Green&rdquo; on repeat in my bedroom, I had real, but very cheap, speakers, so the experience isn&rsquo;t exactly comparable.</p>
<p>On other R.E.M. album remasters, I have found that I can understand every one of Michael Stipe&rsquo;s elliptical, nonsense lyrics on R.E.M.&rsquo;s oldest songs, and that isn&rsquo;t always a good thing. By the time R.E.M. made &ldquo;Green&rdquo;, Michael Stipe&rsquo;s lyrics were a lot more straightforward, and his singing was clear and up front in the mix.</p>
<p>Anyway, &ldquo;Green&rdquo; was and is still great. It was fun to revisit it today.</p>

			 <p>Lin-Manuel Miranda is both (1) the primary reason I got interested in the &ldquo;His Dark Materials&rdquo; TV series, and (2) didn&rsquo;t seem right to play the &ldquo;grizzled Texas cowboy&rdquo; character, Lee Scoresby. I barely remember the movie version of &ldquo;The Golden Compass&rdquo;, but what I <em>do</em> remember is Sam Elliott playing that role.</p>
<p>Myles McNutt, writing for the A.V. Club, <a href="https://tv.avclub.com/lin-manuel-miranda-isnt-the-lee-scoresby-we-remember-fr-1840037123">argues that that is intentional, and has a pretty good take on Miranda&rsquo;s part</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lin-Manuel Miranda is not really playing that Lee Scoresby. Yes, he’s an aeronaut, ostensibly from Texas. Yes, he’s got a history with an armored bear. And yes, he is swiftly caught up in Lyra Belacqua’s journey north with the Gyptians to free the children taken by the Gobblers. But his personality and his role within the tonal framework of this story are nothing like the character in the books, which is likely not a byproduct of Miranda’s casting but rather the reason behind it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;His Dark Materials&rdquo; is, mostly, a straight-ahead adaptation of &ldquo;Northern Lights,&rdquo; so the different take on the Lee Scoresby character surprised me. It took me a few minutes to warm up to his performance and take on the character, but, by the middle of the episode, I enjoyed it and was on board with wherever it would lead the series next.</p>

I set up <a href="https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync">shairport-sync</a> on the little Ubuntu server that sits toward the back of my desk, so that I can AirPlay to it from all my iOS devices. AirPlay is great because it transmits audio over WiFi with no quality degredation, and AirPlay devices are always listed in iOS, unlike BlueTooth speakers, which have to be connected to. Next, I configured PulseAudio to automatically switch to my headphone DAC/Amp when I turn it on. (My DAC/amp is a portable one with an internal battery, so I can&rsquo;t leave it plugged in all the time.) So far, so good with the new setup! By far the hardest part of the setup was searching online for the correct instructions to type into the terminal. I was happy to learn that shairport-sync is now in Ubuntu&rsquo;s repositories, but I think that things like this need to be easier to discover, and possible to install, in the GUI.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What’s the most accurate way to describe kids’ relationship to “Frozen”? Adoration is insufficient, and obsession is downright weak. It’s more like a cathexis, an acutely intense energy focused on a singular entity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My daughter was borderline obsessed with Frozen for about five years. It lulled a bit for a while, but the existence of &ldquo;Frozen II&rdquo; on the horizon has revived her enthusiasm, especially with Elsa, quite a bit this year. After months of looking forward to it, my wife and I are taking her to see the sequel this weekend.</p>

			 <p>So far, I have found Apple Arcade to be overwhelming, in terms of number of games available, and underwhelming, in terms of whether I want to spend more time playing games. One gem I found was &ldquo;Shantae and the Seven Sirens&rdquo; (a colorful Metroidvania-style game). I wanted to like the Oceanhorn sequel better than I did, but it just didn&rsquo;t grab me. There are lots of irreverent, mobile-style games, too, which I tried, but can&rsquo;t really justify putting more time into.</p>
<p>I think that I mainly don&rsquo;t have time to play video games right now, and don&rsquo;t want another monthly subscription to worry about (even though it is a low dollar one) either. My plan is to cancel my free trial just before it rolls over into a paid subscription. Perhaps I will try it again later.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The factories that make the drivers don’t care who they sell to; they maintain a certain level of quality because their clients depend on that. And once you’ve sourced the parts, it’s not expensive at all to put them together. “If you have a van and a bottle of glue,” Klasco says, “you can be in the business.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am a happy customer of one of the oldest Chi-Fi brands, HifiMan, which makes planar magnetic headphones at super low prices. Well, their prices are low for what types of products they sell, but in real dollar terms, they are pretty high: HifiMan mostly sell multi-hundred-dollar headphones, not $25 AirPods rip-offs.</p>
<p>I avoid most other Chi-Fi brands, because I would be concerned that build quality, and therefore produce longevity, would be very low. That said, I have paid lots of money for headphones from well-known, well-regarded, non-Chinese brands, and had them break in under two years.</p>

			 <p>[Tove Danovich writes about the Teal Pumpkin project on NPR.org](Teal Pumpkins Make Halloween Less Tricky For Kids With Food Allergies):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having a teal pumpkin on the doorstep (teal being the color of food allergy awareness) is a way to signal to people with food allergies that this is a safe home for trick-or-treating, says Jennifer Norris, president of the Food Allergy Community of East Tennessee (FACET), which started the project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I learned about the teal pumpkins a couple years ago, and we have been a teal pumpkin house on Halloween ever since.</p>
<p>Since discovering that my children have peanut allergies, Halloween has moved from a fun tradition to an endless, irritating minefield of peanut-containing, and potentially peanut-contaminated, foods. (Practically every candy or baked good with chocolate may be contaminated with peanuts. As parents, my wife and I have to be very strict and diligent.) So much candy is off limits to my kids that it makes me feel sad for them. I think they do miss out on a huge, terribly unheathy part of the experience: the candy. We are baking some brownies and have purchased some truly safe, peanut-free chocolate for them, so Halloween will still be fun, even if the collecting candy part of trick-or-treating is kind of pointless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, said on Wednesday that the social media service would ban political ads on its platform, in a stark contrast to rival Facebook, which has faced blowback for taking a hands-off approach to political advertising.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is definitely the correct position to take, based on what we already know about the scale and effectiveness of social media disinformation campaigns, which are largely driven through social media advertising. Facebook, in contrast to Twitter, seems to be doubling down on their willingness for &ldquo;anything goes&rdquo; political advertising on its platform.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, the highly competitive Pay TV industry, with expensive content and network deals, has been slower to change than we expected,” said John Kodera, deputy president of Sony Interactive Entertainment, in a statement on the PlayStation Blog. “Because of this, we have decided to remain focused on our core gaming business.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s too bad, but not at all surprising.</p>
<p>I never understood why someone would want to watch TV on their PlayStation. For me, at least, gaming and TV don’t mix at all. I feel a huge mode switch between interactive and non-interactive entertainment. It wouldn&rsquo;t occur to me to want to do anything other than game on a gaming console.</p>
<p>Also, to me at least, Sony is not a brand I strongly identify with and want to align with additional areas of my life. I <em>do</em> like my Sony headphones, and <em>did</em> have a Playstation Portable long ago, but Sony has never been, in my opinion, a warm and appealing brand.</p>

They will say that nobody goes to Luger for the sole, nobody goes to Luger for the wine, nobody goes to Luger for the salad, nobody goes to Luger for the service. The list goes on, and gets harder to swallow, until you start to wonder who really needs to go to Peter Luger, and start to think the answer is nobody.</p>

			 <p>John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/10/mails_message_action_toolbar_in_ios_13">took note of the terrible UI decisions Apple made on its iOS Mail app</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new toolbar in iOS 13 Mail is just strange. The old toolbar had discrete buttons for Flag, Move, Trash/Archive, Reply, and New Message. Now it’s just Trash and Reply, with all of the other functionality stashed in the new Reply action sheet, pictured here half-height and full-height. That new “Reply” action sheet is really a “Do Something With This Message” sheet — I’m not sure what the icon for this should be, but the Reply icon seems like an odd choice. I know a few people who assumed that iOS 13 removed the ability to move messages to other mailboxes because the folder button was removed from the toolbar. They — reasonably! — never thought to look for it by tapping what clearly looks like the old familiar Reply icon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanted to write about this for the past couple weeks, but decided not to complain to my blog about software that I could probably replace, if it really bothered me enough. I thought that Mail was perfect on iOS 12 and now it is much, much worse for me. The functionality I use most often—delete, archive, flag—is now two or three taps (or taps and swipes) away, when it used to be all in one tap at the bottom of the screen.</p>

			 <p>Chris Welsh from The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913658/beats-solo-pro-noise-canceling-headphones-announced-features-specs-price">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beats is today introducing the Solo Pro, a $299.95 set of wireless headphones that add noise cancellation to the on-ear form factor shared by the company’s long line of previous Solo headphones. These are, for all intents and purposes, the Solo 4 Wireless, but they’ve been rebranded to match the Powerbeats Pro (and iPhone 11 Pro and every other tech product that now has “pro” tacked on to its name). The new headphones, Beats’ first on-ears with active noise cancellation, will ship on October 30th.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if these are the rumored Apple over-the-ear headphones. I will hold out hope that they are not, and that some crazy high-end audiophile headphones are still in our future.</p>

			 <p>My Catalina upgrade was a headache. Here is a bullet list of my woes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The install process stalled for about an hour on &ldquo;Setting up your Mac&rdquo;. I eventually gave up waiting and forced my Mac to shut down. Luckily, after a reboot, the installation continued and completed in mere seconds.</li>
<li>System Preferences alerted me that there was a problem with my iCloud account sign-in. Entering my credentials again (several times) did not resolve the warning. I ignored it, at first, until I discovered the following two items.</li>
<li>All my iCloud drive files in the Documents and Desktop folders were missing.</li>
<li>My iTunes library was not displayed in the new Music app. I eventually found a preference that had to be enabled that brought them back, after a slight delay.</li>
<li>To fix the iCloud account and iCloud Drive problems, I signed out of iCloud Drive. During the sign-out process, I let it back up all my files to a local folder, which took a long time. After the backup finished, I signed back into iCloud, and iCloud Drive re-downloaded all my files. It took a while for my files to re-appear; the wait was stressful, even though I have backups.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was another one of those years in which a macOS upgrade made me wish I was an iOS (and now iPadOS) user only. That said, my computer did not get bricked, which happened with an automated Windows 10 update on one of my other machines a little while ago.</p>

			 <p>Apple Maps is significantly better in my part of the world (New Jersey) than it was a couple days ago. Justin O&rsquo;Beirne documented many of these improvements <a href="https://www.justinobeirne.com/new-apple-maps-northeast">in an epic article, full of graphics that illustrate the types of improvements that were made</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On September 30, 2019, Apple’s new map expanded to the Northeast U.S.
This is the fifth time that Apple has expanded its new map since its public launch in September 2018.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The before-and-after screenshots in his blog post tell a dramatic story about filling in all sorts of mapping data gaps. I am seeing the same kinds of dramatic changes illustrated in this article in the maps of my hometown in the metro-Hartford area and of my current town, in the metro-New York City area.</p>
<p>I hope that Apple was also able to improve its routing algorithms for driving directions. I have been disappointed with both Apple Maps and Google Maps on numerous trips to, and around, New York City in the past year. <em>Both</em> were bad at recommending a sensible route, and in similar ways.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Years ago, in an effort to answer a perennial question — what’s the best way to boil an egg? — I hatched a plan using the only method I know: lots and lots of testing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kenji&rsquo;s egg boiling method, which is egg <em>steaming</em> actually, is probably better than my own, which I picked up from <a href="https://twitter.com/altonbrown/status/188731859809734657">Alton Brown</a>. The way I do it makes perfect whites and yolks, but the eggs are nearly impossible to peel. Apparently, steaming eggs makes them easier to peel. I have got to try it!</p>

			 <p>Matt Birchler posted <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/watchos-6-the-birchtree-review/">his review of watchOS 6</a> today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>watchOS 6 is not a massive update to the platform, and you will likely use your watch in largely the same way you always have, but there are some new apps, nice usability updates, no real regressions, and frameworks that will allow third party apps to get better in the future. Basically, it won’t all change your life, but there is probably at least one or two things that you’ll really enjoy in this new update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not exactly <em>eager</em> to upgrade my Apple Watch immediately, because it works just fine and I am happy with its behavior and performance, but I am looking forward to the new watch faces, which I think look nice.</p>
<p>I have had an Apple Watch since the original Series 0, but I have always been a little disappointed in the watch faces. I find it harder to read the time on the analog faces, based on simple things like the relative shortness of the hour hand, and, on many faces, the lack of numbers or larger hour markers on the dial. Also, I have long wanted a watch face with seven small complications and the time in the upper right corner, which would act as an app launcher for all the apps I use on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s new watch faces will provide some more visual variety, especially the California face, which will have various configuration options regarding the numbers on the dial. I do wish that Apple would allow you to change the shape and size of the watch hands, though. They are the same on every analog-style watch face.</p>

			 <p>I have been working on a PowerShell and SQL-heavy project at work for about a week now. To facilitate PowerShell development, I installed and configured Visual Studio Code, which is Microsoft&rsquo;s Electron-based code editor. I was not a fan of Visual Studio Code (hereafter called, simply, Code), due mainly to its lumbering speed when compared to Sublime Text, and somewhat, too, due to its brutalist design aesthetic.</p>
<p>I must say, after using it for PowerShell development and debugging, that Code has grown on my quite a lot. I can develop, run, and debug PowerShell scripts in an IDE environment, edit Markdown files, and can even run SQL commands against my SQL Server Express instance (though query running is really slow compared to SQL Server Management Studio). There are many, many powerful extensions—way more than I would have expected. Some of them let me do other useful things, like convert delimited files to Excel right in the editor, that just aren&rsquo;t possible in Sublime Text.</p>
<p>There are some drawbacks, though. RAM use is extremely high—nearly a gig even when there is only one file open—and runs, for me, about ten times as much RAM as Sublime Text uses. Also, it is really slow compared to Sublime Text. Loading even small files takes a few seconds, and I have to wait for syntax highlighting to be applied to the files after they are displayed in the editor for the first time. Still, I am liking it, and am using it, more and more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After months of teasers and trailers, HBO has finally announced a release date for its upcoming His Dark Materials TV series, which is adapted from the popular fantasy book series by Philip Pullman. It’ll premiere on November 4th on HBO and a day earlier (on November 3rd) on BBC One in the UK.</p>

<p>This is something I am excited about—excited enough to subscribe to HBO again to watch—despite not <em>absolutely</em> loving Philip Pullman&rsquo;s books or the movie version of <em>The Golden Compass</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The big new feature this year is an always-on display option so you can see the time without having to move your wrist, something that has been asked for since the Apple Watch first debuted in 2015.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple is going to sell boatloads of Series 5 watches to upgraders, due to the new, always-on display. That is the one feature—and pretty much the only feature—I wish my Apple Watch 4 had.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple is also permanently dropping the price of the Series 3 to $199, matching the lowest sale price on that model we’ve seen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple will also sell boatloads of Series 3 watches at the new, lower price, too. Apple is wisely going down-market with their older watch models, just like they do with the older iPhone models.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/30/apple-tile-like-tag-item-tracker-what-to-expect/">Per Joe Rossignol and Steve Moser in MacRumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple is developing a Tile-like accessory that will help users keep track of their personal belongings, such as their keys, wallets, and backpacks, according to an internal build of iOS 13 seen by MacRumors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am a Tile user, and have been for years. I tried and gave up on Tile&rsquo;s main competitor, Trackr, because Tile worked better, despite its higher cost. I use a Tile once every few weeks or so to find my keys, but in the past I have used them to track our cars and luggage, too. A Tile fails to work when is when it is out of range of a Tile user&rsquo;s mobile phone, which is pretty much all the time in the suburbs where I live.</p>
<p>Though it ultimately depends on price, I expect I would switch from Tile to an Apple Tile-like device, if Apple ever actually releases one. My main reasoning is that they would probably be far more popular than the Tile or the Trackr, which means that there will be more people will be tied into their network. Apple will have to allow people to opt into being part of the &ldquo;Find My Item&rdquo; network, I suppose, but I still think many would do so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Deaths caused by motorists running red lights has risen to a 10-year-high, a newly released study finds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would assume that those ubiquitous red light cameras aren&rsquo;t working to keep people safer. AAA came to the opposite conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AAA recommends putting red light cameras in areas that have a pattern of crashes, with local law enforcement officials directly supervising the cameras.
&ldquo;Camera enforcement is a proven way to reduce red-light running and save lives,&rdquo; said Jessica Cicchino of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess so, but I bet the squad car &ldquo;enforcing&rdquo; the red light camera is the actual effective agent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still, some party officials lamented a system that limited exposure for lesser-known candidates. The Nebraska Democratic Party chairwoman, Jane Kleeb, a leading figure among rural Democrats, said a debate process that excluded Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana was bad for a party trying to win back voters who flocked to President Trump in 2016.
“Voters aren’t even going to know who Steve Bullock is and that we have a governor representing a red state and doing it with strong progressive values,” Ms. Kleeb said. “To me it shows the strength of our party that we have so many people running.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know Ms. Kleeb is merely supporting her candidate, but why is he even running if he has no national presence?</p>
<p>Honestly, if hardly anybody knows who you are, why do you think you can win an election for President of the United States? 🤷‍♂️</p>

<p>I’m neither a Luddite nor a cheapskate. But after testing hundreds of tech products — and buying some along the way — over the last dozen years, I’ve come to a conclusion: People will almost always get more joy from technology the longer they wait for it to mature. Cutting-edge gadgets can invoke awe and temptation, but being an early adopter involves risk, and the downsides usually outweigh the benefits.</p>

<p>But looking back all these years later, I can’t help but wonder: Why were we so mad about U2 putting a free album on our phones? Wouldn’t it be wonderful to live again in a pre-Trump world, where you had the luxury to get worked up about a so-called Orwellian scheme involving a melancholic late-period U2 record? Isn’t it crazy that people cared so much about this?</p>

<p>I listened to that album a couple times when it appeared on my iPhone, but found it forgettable. I may just give it another shot, now that I am no longer irate about getting it for free from Apple. 😜</p>

<p>I got fed up trying to figure out how to fix Windows, so I burned a live USB installer for Ubuntu and tried it out.

			 <p>I got the Apple Card about a week ago, and just started using it this weekend. Here are some initial thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>I very much like the security and privacy features Apple Pay and the Apple Card. I try to use Apple Pay whenever I can to take advantage of most of these features, no matter what card I was using.</li>
<li>I very much like the enhancements to the Wallet app on my iPhone to review transactions and spending.</li>
<li>2% cash back on all Apple Pay purchases seems like a pretty good benefit to me.</li>
<li>3% back on Apple transactions seems a little stingy, considering that Amazon and Target offer 5% back when you use their branded cards. I would get a much better cash-back rate buying an Apple product on Amazon, using my Amazon.com Visa.</li>
<li>The interest rate offered to me was the lowest that they offer, and it is a between two and three percentage points lower than the other cards I have. I never carry a balance, so it doesn’t mean much to me.</li>
<li>I had a false-alarm fraud alert shortly after I set it up. I made it my default on my Apple account, and a $30 annual subscription fee trigged a fraud alert. I contacted Apple Card support via iMessage, and cleared up the problem.</li>
<li>Buying different things changes the color of the card in the Wallet app, which is amusing. The colors correspond to the spending charts.</li>
<li>I had a lot of trouble adding the card to my Apple Watch. It took lots of fiddling with settings, but, fortunately, I did not have to unpair and repair the Apple Watch to my iPhone.</li>
<li>The titanium card is boring and heavy. I expect to never use it. Its best feature is that my card number is not printed on it.</li>
<li>Some common features are missing: a website, integration with personal finance applications, and joint accounts (or authorized users).</li>
</ol>

			 <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/books/watersones-barnes-and-noble-james-daunt.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share">David Segal&rsquo;s article</a> poses the question. I hope the answer is yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Barnes &amp; Noble has been sliding toward oblivion for years. Nearly 400 stores have closed since 1997 — there are 627 now operating — and $1 billion in market value has evaporated in the last five years. This week, Elliott Advisors, the private equity firm that owns Waterstones, closed its deal to buy Barnes &amp; Noble for $683 million. Mr. Daunt will move to New York City this month and serve as the new chief executive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have lots of fond memories of Barnes &amp; Noble over the years—despite the fact that I liked Borders even better. My wife and kids still like it, so we go to the one closest to us pretty often. It is, in many ways, a sad, pale shadow of its former self. The Nook section is large and empty. It is easier to find toys in there than books. I don&rsquo;t really understand why they still sell so many DVDs and CDs in the back.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Frankly, at the moment you want to love Barnes &amp; Noble, but when you leave the store you feel mildly betrayed,” Mr. Daunt said over lunch at a Japanese restaurant near his office in Piccadilly Circus. “Not massively, but mildly. It’s a bit ugly — there’s piles of crap around the place. It all feels a bit unloved, the booksellers look a bit miserable, it’s all a bit run down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I keep wondering when our local store will shut its doors, though I don&rsquo;t want it to.  I am eager for a turnaround.</p>

			 <p>I really enjoyed this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/07/magazine/nicholas-cage-interview.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share">profile of Nicholas Cage</a>, by David Marchese.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to know why Cage, Hollywood’s greatest surrealist, whose personal and creative unpredictability has led him to attain near-mythological status in certain corners of the internet, acts in so many movies — 20 in the last two years — and why so few of them make mainstream ripples. (His most recent release: the straightforwardly titled thriller “A Score to Settle.”) But mostly I wanted to know the method behind the seeming madness that informs so many of his performances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a pretty fascinating read, even if, like me, you only have a casual familiarity with Nick Cage&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>This is bound to end badly for Facebook. I can think of no one who thinks Facebook is a strong brand, let alone stronger than Instagram or WhatsApp.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My wife and I learned today that my two-year-old son has severe peanut allergies. My daughter does too, so at least we know what to do, but it is very unfortunate news. It is a deadly serious condition. There are so many foods that peanut allergy suffers can’t eat—most of which don’t even have peanuts in them, but are processed on equipment that also processes peanuts—that most packaged foods are disallowed. Most candy is unsafe. Hard ice cream, at restaurants and ice cream places, isn’t safe either, because it or the scoops used to scoop it get cross-contaminated with peanuts. Fortunately, we have found some peanut-free sources for foods like chocolate, and can bake our own treats at home. With two peanut-allergy-having kids, I think I’m going to be baking a lot of cakes at home from now on (for every birthday party, ever), and learning how to make things like chocolate candy and maybe even homemade ice cream.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>From what I have heard of Sleater-Kinney&rsquo;s new album, &ldquo;<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-center-wont-hold/1463695430">The Center Won&rsquo;t Hold</a>&rdquo;, it certainly sounds different than their older stuff. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/arts/music/sleater-kinney-st-vincent.html?action=click&amp;module=Well&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;section=Arts">This arcticle</a>, by Melena Rezwik, in the New York Times, provides some context <em>why</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since its self-titled 1995 debut, Sleater-Kinney has been revered as one of indie rock&rsquo;s most musically fierce and lyrically sharp bands, cutting a path for passionate musicians who refuse to check their politics or their emotions at the club door. The band’s signature sound — Brownstein and Tucker’s guitars and vocals winding around each other in stinging counterpoint, anchored by Weiss’s deft, thundering drumming — always relied on its precise chemistry. On the eve of its ninth studio album, Sleater-Kinney is now skimmed down to its founding duo, Tucker, 46, and Brownstein, 44.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sleater-Kinney was a big part of the soundtrack to my 20s and early 30s. They were magnificent, and I am happy they are still making music, even if they are now down a member. I can&rsquo;t wait for their entire new album to drop on August 16.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The once obscure congressman from El Paso who brought in an astounding nearly $80 million in his Senate race reported a measly $3.6 million, way down from his $9.4 million in the first quarter. Jay Inslee is gaining on him. How did this happen? Many answers lie in the difference between running for office in Texas and running nationally. The first showed all of Mr. O’Rourke’s strengths, and the second each and every weakness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, Beto is running the wrong race. I think he would have a legitimate shot at winning Cornyn&rsquo;s senate seat in Texas, and that he has wasted valuable time pursuing the presidency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sony may have only released the RX100 VI last year, but the company is already back with an updated model called the RX100 VII.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am excited to see that Sony is still revving its RX100 camera. I have an RX100 Mark I, which I don&rsquo;t use too much any more, since I got a micro 4/3 camera, but I still love it. It takes great pictures, is incredibly versatile, and fits in a relatively tiny belt-loop holster case, so I can take it anywhere. It may be slower than a smartphone camera, and have fewer features than a more recent model, but it still takes great pictures, and is pretty easy to use as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The RX100 VII will be available later in August 2019 for $1,200 for the camera alone. Later in 2019, the aforementioned Shooting Grip Kit bundle will be available for $1,300. It will be available for preorder at B&amp;H Photo and Adorama later today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s an over-$1,000 pocket camera, though, which is a market segment that sounds like it shouldn&rsquo;t even exist. I bought my Mark I used for $300, right after the RX-100 Mark II was released. Since then, owners have been more keen on selling their old ones for much higher prices, which has kept me from upgrading. Maybe someday I will pick up one from a few generations back.</p>

			 <p>I enjoyed reading this article from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/magazine/electronic-music-synthesizers.html">New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Estrada was playing a Pocket Operator, a device released four years ago by a Swedish company called Teenage Engineering. To date, the company has made nine different models of the same basic design, and it has sold more than 350,000 of them worldwide, making the Pocket Operator one of the most popular synthesizers in history. The Korg M1 — famous for producing the sound of Seinfeld’s slap bass and Madonna’s “Vogue,” and one of the best-selling and most influential synths of all time — is estimated to have sold 100,000 fewer units over nearly twice as much time. The “portable” version of one of the Pocket Operator’s earliest forebears — the telharmonium, constructed more than a hundred years ago — cost more than $5 million to build in today’s dollars, weighed 200 tons and required a team of specialists to achieve peak performance. A Pocket Operator costs about $60 and fits in the palm of your hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pocket synth by Teenage Engineering, the company that designed Panic&rsquo;s upcoming <a href="https://play.date">PlayDate</a> handheld gaming console, looks really cool. I kind of want to pick one up, even though I no longer consider myself a musician of any kind.</p>

			 <p>I think that every bit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/07/16/us/politics/democratic-fundraising-2020.html">of this article from the New York Times</a> illustrates what is wrong with the way we pick presidents in the US.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Five Democratic presidential candidates raised a combined $96 million from individual donors in the last three months — about three-quarters of the total fund-raising by the entire Democratic field, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission on Monday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have to admit that I am annoyed because my favorite candidate is not at the top of the fundraising list. That is a small worry, though. Overall, I am annoyed that all this money is spread out so widely amongst candidates,
many of whom should gracefully drop out and run for lower, but still very important, offices.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trump looms over everything like Calamity Ganon over Hyrule Castle in &ldquo;Breath of the Wild&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trump has more than twice as much cash as the best-funded Democrats.</p>
<p>President Trump has a big head start on the Democratic field in raising money for the 2020 election. He ended the second quarter with far more cash on hand than even the best-funded Democratic candidate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think the Democratic candidates and campaign strategists have a real plan to win. I know there is still a good amount of time to make such a plan, but I’m not sure if there is enough time. I am already tired of the primary process, and it has barely even begun.</p>

<p>I use two older ones so far for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pi-hole server (DNS/ad-blocking)</li>
<li>Homebridge server (to control my Nest thermostat via Sirit &amp; HomeKit)</li>

<li>A VPN server</li>
<li>A self-hosted RSS back-end for Reeder (accessible via the VPN)</li>
<li>A download server that connects to my NAS (I used to use a Raspberry Pi for this, but it was really, really slow)</li>
</ul>
<p>I could, of course, replace all of these single-purpose servers with a single Intel box running virtual machines. I have not found such a thing at a good price, or that runs silently. My NAS box, currently running FreeNAS, is off limits right now when it comes to adding Internet-facing services. It is also too old and under-resourced to dedicate chunks of its RAM to virtual machines.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I have done a lot of research on cryptocurrencies for work, and keep coming back to my thoughts that they are a scam. Bitcoin works like a pyramid scheme, where the early adopters (the early miners) gain the lions share of wealth, once the value of the coin increases, due to the way that mining works. In the best case scenario of cryptocurrency use, some companies will do an end run around the current financial system intermediaries, and insert themselves as the <em>new</em> financial system intermediaries. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency holders/customers are trading worthless bits they can&rsquo;t pay their taxes with.</p>

Next fall, however, when Apple&rsquo;s OS cycle turns over again, would be a great time for me to finish up SwiftUI-based rewrites and push them to production.

Apple never gave me a case number, sent me an email, put a record of the repair on its support website, or gave me any idea that it knew that it had my laptop. It seems weird to me to get no type of receipt after handing over my laptop, but if it comes back today, all is well in the end, I guess.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SwiftUI is not compatible with earlier versions of iOS, macOS, or any of Apple’s other operating systems. So, to start adopting it, you either need to decide that it’s acceptable for the app in which you’ll use SwiftUI to only work on the latest operating systems — or you’ll need to ”gate off” the features written in Swift UI from older versions, using Swift’s @available syntax.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found this post by <a href="https://micro.blog/johnsundell">@johnsundell</a> to be a very useful, concise explanation of what I need to know right now about Swift UI.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, it tells me that I can wait a little while to adopt it. My time this year would be better served refactoring my codebase to prepare for a SwiftUI transition next year. For example, I can already start work on getting rid of storyboards in SwiftoDo for iOS, and that will prepare me for the storyboard-free future with SwiftUI.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2019/05/13/game-of-thrones.html">Game of Thrones Season 8 has become yet another thing for everyone to be angry about</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2019/05/13/game-of-thrones.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-05-13 09:13:50 -0500">May 13, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I did not hate the latest &ldquo;Game of Thrones&rdquo; episode. I actually liked it, thought it was effective, and thought it made sense. This <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/game-of-thrones-recap-season-8-episode-5-the-bells.html">recap from Vulture</a> describes the way I feel about it pretty accurately.</p>
<p>Of course, having browsed the web since the penultimate episode aired, I now think that I am in the minority opinion. People are <em>so angry</em> about what is going on in this season that I am quite taken aback. I suppose a lot of these complainers have not seen &ldquo;Lost&rdquo; or &ldquo;Battlestar Galactica&rdquo;, and have no idea how a top-tier series can <em>really</em> go off the rails at the end.</p>
<p>I think that I have been telling myself the ending will be disappointing for so long now that I am not even disappointed by whatever weaknesses and expectation shortfalls I see in it. My theory about all stories is that they are most exciting when they are <em>beginning</em>. Great epic stories are always beginning and beginning and beginning. The world of the story keeps expanding, as do all the life and possibilities within it. At some point, though, the story has to end, and the world built for it starts to contract. This is always disappointing. Things don&rsquo;t happen that you want to happen. Narrative threads end, or simply get dropped. Questions get answered (and questions are always more interesting than answers) or, maybe, not answered. Characters don&rsquo;t always develop or act in ways that you have imagined them. The author&rsquo;s vision of the endgame may not align yours. When the story ends, it contracts down to a single point, and what is left may not be what you want. Even if it is, you are sad to leave your favorite characters and story ideas behind.</p>
<p>To sum up, there are many reasons why endings are disappointing, and there is almost nothing that can be done to help that in certain genres. &ldquo;Game of Thrones&rdquo; has been in this trap for a while now, and has thus far avoided the worst of all television series fates, for me at least: I still want to watch the ending and find out what happens.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2019/05/08/bye-bye-homebridge.html">Bye bye Homebridge support for Nest</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2019/05/08/bye-bye-homebridge.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-05-08 22:19:54 -0500">May 8, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I noticed an email from Google in my Spam folder this evening (copied, by someone else, <a href="https://github.com/KraigM/homebridge-nest/issues/203">here</a>) stating that the Works with Nest API is shutting down on August 31. That&rsquo;s the API that makes my Nest work with HomeKit, via the <a href="https://github.com/KraigM/homebridge-nest">homebridge-nest</a> plugin. It is yet another mildly upsetting thing Google is doing that involves killing a product that some people use.</p>
<p>I have had a Nest thermostat for years—well before Google even owned Nest. It is the only smart thermostat that I know of that will work in my house, because I do not have a common wire (which carries low-voltage power) in my heating and air conditioning system, and have no easy access to power near the Nest itself. (The Nest handles that situation just fine, but the other products I have researched, such as the Ecobee, would not.)</p>
<p>Overall, the Nest is OK. Its most important feature for me is that can be set via Wifi. The Nest application, however, is slow to load, buggy, and, if anything, has gotten worse over the years as Nest has added support for its other, non-thermostat products. It often forces me to log in again to my Google account (which is a multi-step process), and does not integrate with Siri or the iOS Control Center. Homebridge solved all those software limitations for me, but was dependent on this developer API that is now going away.</p>
<p>I hope that Google will provide a new API that I can use with Homebridge going forward, but at this point, I doubt that they will. On the plus side, I guess I can unplug the Raspberry Pi I have been running on.</p>

			 <p>My FreeNAS server is back <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2019/05/07/freenas-server-i.html">from the dead</a>. After it stopped working and wouldn&rsquo;t boot, I needed to plug in a monitor with a VGA connector (which I didn&rsquo;t have yesterday) to see what was going on. It turns out that the boot drive, a USB stick, had failed.</p>
<p>Luckily, I have a couple other USB sticks lying around, and I had saved the FreeNAS configuration to my Mac recently. I was able to re-install FreeNAS to a new USB stick, re-upload my old configuration, and I lost no data or settings.</p>
<p>I think I will buy two identical USB sticks in the near future and mirror the boot drives. I would prefer this server to just run until the motherboard or power supply dies. This short period of downtime made me question whether I should even <em>have</em> a home server (or at least <em>this</em> home server), which is a question that I don&rsquo;t really want to spend time thinking about right now.</p>

			 <p>So&hellip;my new SwiftoDo Desktop app for the Mac would be 100% complete right now, if I hadn&rsquo;t decided, 75% of the way through writing it, to add a secondary edit mode for the todo.txt file. That mode makes the user interface comparable to the iOS version of SwiftoDo, but is also loads better in subtle ways, such as being able to reload the file (in either mode) if an external editor (such as iCloud Drive) modifies the underlying task list file. Of course, that makes everything so much harder to implement in a bug-free way. I have been discovering and trying to fix bugs over the past week or so. I have been messing with the lowest-level code in my app far more than I would normally be doing at this stage in the game. I&rsquo;m trying to finish up the version and release it soon. I will get there, but it makes me nervous to jump back into file coordination related bugs, when I thought I had perfected those features almost six months ago.</p>

			 <p>I listened to this <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carole_cadwalladr_facebook_s_role_in_brexit_and_the_threat_to_democracy">TED Talk</a> yesterday, via the TED podcast. Carole Cadwalladr&rsquo;s message was chilling but not at all surprising, considering just how much news there is about how Facebook (mostly) is abused to undermine trust in facts, in institutions, in each other, and, ultimately, in democratic elections.</p>
<p>Dark money flowing into ephemeral, misleading, highly-targeted advertising is rightly identified as the leading cause of these problems. Sometimes I think that if the advertising element were removed from Facebook, a lot of these problems go away. After all, isn&rsquo;t the problem that people can pay to publish whatever they want, targeted to whoever they want, and there is no tradable record of it anywhere thereafter? But after thinking about it for a little while longer, I think that the advertisements are only part of the problem. The algorithms that target content, wherever it comes from, to the most engaged (most gullible?) users, are another huge part of the problem. People will spread <em>user</em>-generated misleading nonsense almost as fast as the targeted advertisements will spread.</p>
<p>I have concluded that the human brain isn&rsquo;t well adapted to the scale, speed, and the algorithmic targeting of information that social media sites. Those are the very things that make a site like Facebook work. These kind of websites are flawed because our brains are flawed. That&rsquo;s a problem that is not possible to solve.</p>

			 <p>The burning of Notre Dame shook me to my core yesterday.</p>
<p>The images and videos made me so upset that I thought I was going crazy. After all, it is just a building, and presumably no one died, so what is the big deal? Still, the cathedral is a symbol of beauty and hope—literally of reaching to the sky to a higher power—and, to me at least, of human achievement, collective action, and indomitable spirit. To see it, a world monument, burning up (and potentially collapsing altogether, though thankfully that did not happen) deeply troubled me.</p>
<p>I have thought about it a little more now, and have realized something: When upsetting things occur, it makes sense to be upset, even if what is happening isn&rsquo;t <em>the most</em> upsetting thing that could occur. Feeling so bad wasn&rsquo;t really a bad thing for my me, and it wasn&rsquo;t an outsized emotion to something that wasn&rsquo;t really affecting me. I&rsquo;m not crazy; I&rsquo;m <em>sensitive</em>, and that&rsquo;s OK.</p>

			 <p>For someone who is, now, only marginally interested in television and movies, I have spent a lot of time and money over the years to make my television watching experience awesome. I used to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> into it, and—unless you had a lot of money to burn—it used to be hard to get it working correctly, which fed into my engineering mindset and led me to tinker with hardware and software frequently, for almost a decade.</p>
<p>I started in 2008 by connecting my 13” white MacBook to my (non-HD) TV via a $30 video adapter. Even though my TV was primitive, picture quality was way better when playing video this way, and I could watch streaming videos directly from the networks’ web sites, like “Lost”, on my real TV for the first time. I loved it. After about a year of this, I got a mini-PC as a Christmas gift, which I started using, with an external hard drive, as a home media server.</p>
<p>For the front end, I bought a set-top box that Western Digital used to sell. The system worked&hellip;mostly. Streaming over WiFi was reliable for non-HD (480p) and 720p HD encoded TV shows, but anything with higher resolutions, higher bit rates, or DTS audio would usually be impossible to play.</p>
<p>I was never serious enough to buy an expensive computer to connect to my TV, because I figured, correctly it turns out, that video streaming devices would become cheaper and more capable over time. Of course, during that time, I cycled through a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ton<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of set-top boxes (most of which I got for free as review units): Roku boxes, a couple Roku knock-offs, the Boxee Box, the first Amazon Fire TV, an Amazon Fire TV Stick (which was quickly returned), a couple Raspberry Pis running XMBC (which worked great for TV but stumbled on DTS audio), and eventually a number of Apple TVs (fourth generation).</p>
<p>The reason I went through so many front-ends is that they all had two limitations. First, each one left out at least one of the top video sources: either iTunes, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or Plex. (Nothing left out Netflix.) Second, all of them choked on certain sorts of videos, depending on their audio or video encodings.</p>
<p>Eventually, I began to watch video on my iPad while I work. This led me to discover Plex in the App Store. Plex is a server that you can install on a computer, coupled with client apps that run on many different devices. Plex looks great, has server side transcoding to make video formats less of an issue, and allows you to manage a centralized library of TV, movies, music, and more. I used Plex on an Amazon Fire TV for a year or two. I started out very happy with it, but the software stability of the Amazon Fire TV decreased over time, and Plex and Amazon did not release software updates timely enough to fix it. Eventually, I was very unhappy with the Fire TV + Plex combo, but still pretty happy running Plex on my iPad.</p>
<p>When the Apple TV, 4th generation, was released, with support for iTunes, Apple Music, Netflix, YouTube, and Plex, I bought one right away. I figured, at the time, that Apple was so big that only it had any chance to get all the major video providers on a single box, and get them to stay long term. (Amazon, of course, was conspicuously absent for several years, but that was not as important to me back then as it is now.) I didn’t expect to love it for to watch baseball on MLB At Bat, but it plays games at 1080p/60fps, which looks amazing, so I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Over time, home media streaming went from being a niche hobby, in which nerds like me tried to hook up computers to their TVs, to a very mainstream way to consume video and audio. Thanks to cheap and nearly ubiquitous modern hardware, my home media streaming “hobby”, has basically come to an end. I still maintain a Plex library, but I no longer have to upgrade or to fiddle with hardware connected to my TV, or worry about audio and video encodings and bit rates before I watch a movie with my wife. I also stream a lot more video from outside the home (not via Plex) than I ever did before—just like everybody else these days. It’s not special any more; it’s just another entertainment product, and it deserves very little thought, because it just works. Things are much better now, but sometimes I do miss tinkering with hardware.</p>

			 <p>I started updating my apps to Swift 5.0 today. It has been a pretty easy migration for me, so far, but it has reminded me how much I dislike dependencies and CocoaPods. I think I&rsquo;m going to ditch all CocoaPods eventually and just take over, for myself, whatever open source code I use.</p>
<p>I will be submitting the new build of Simple Call Blocker, my free anti-neighbor spam app, soon. I don&rsquo;t plan to release the update to my other iOS app, SwiftoDo, for another week or so.</p>

			 <p>Apple announced Apple Card at its event on Monday. Details are incomplete, but its announcement excited me more than the media-related services Apple announced at the same event. Perhaps that is because I pay for things every day, but don’t watch much TV, and my wife and I are happy with our New Yorker subscription (she reads the physical magazine; I read it online) and our New York Times subscription (which we both read via its iOS app).</p>
<p>Apple Card interests me because I use Apple Pay all the time, and Apple Card’s Apple Pay-specific cash back rewards are a 33% better than what I get from either of my two current credit cards on the things I purchase most. From a pure spending and getting rewards perspective, Apple Card seems like a winner to me.</p>
<p>I am a somewhat baffled, however, at the Apple commentators’ many takes on how Apple Card&rsquo;s rewards are mediocre. I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->suppose<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that may be the case for people who want travel rewards, but if you want cash back <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> can use Apple Pay at your local supermarkets and restaurants, Apple Card is a winner.</p>
<p>I base my opinion on lots of research into the best cash back cards. For the past twenty years, I have been a cash-back-rewards seeker who researches credit cards on NerdWallet and BankRate at least once a year, and occasionally jumps from one card to another. Based on my research, I already have the best credit cards <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for me<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, from a rewards perspective. Apple&rsquo;s credit card&rsquo;s cash back rewards system is better than all of them, again, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for me<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Two percent cash back on all Apple Pay purchases would increase the cash back I get from my largest non-mortgage monthly expense category, supermarket spending, from 1.5% to 2%.</p>
<p>I heard on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TWIT<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this week that Apple Card does not have certain protections most credit cards come from, like purchase price protection and extended warranties. That doesn&rsquo;t matter to me, though, as I have not used those benefits in the 20+ years I have had a credit card.</p>
<p>Apple Card’s announced interest rates fall within what I think is a normal range. Each customer’s interest rate will depend on their credit rating, so it is technically unknown until each person applies for it. Apple has not made it clear whether there is a monthly billing cycle with an interest-free grace period, which is common. This leads to more uncertainty about it, as better cash back rewards are not helpful if you have to pay interest on every purchase. I almost never carry a credit card balance, though, so whatever Apple&rsquo;s interest rate is for me, and provided there is a normal grace period for purchases, it does not matter.</p>
<p>All in all, Apple Card sounds like a good deal for a lot of Apple’s customers.</p>

			 <p>I have been working pretty steadily on finishing version 4.0 of SwiftoDo Desktop. I feel pretty good about the app, in general. It is coded in Swift now, as opposed to Objective C, and has a much more mature, and hopefully easy to support, architecture.</p>
<p>It will be a massive upgrade from version 3. While I would like to charge for it, even for my current customers, I feel bad enough about drastically changing an app I sold, even if it is for the better, that I am strongly considering just releasing it as a free upgrade. That&rsquo;s basically my plan for the next version of SwiftoDo on iOS, which will be based on this codebase as much as possible.</p>
<p>My day job has been super interesting lately. I have hundreds of data analysis work papers to write, and I coded some pretty sophisticated scripts to generate all the data analytics I need to run, review, and report on. If only the software I was using made it easier to generate my work papers. I still have days and days of work ahead of me writing all the work papers that document the process. I also re-learned today about VBA’s superannuated support for interfaces, polymorphism, and delegation, for another project I am working on.</p>
<p>My wife has been baking cookies for Purim this week, which is a lot of fun, but incredibly tempting to me, as I have been on a low-carb diet the past few weeks. I have to loose all the weight I gained over the past 14 months, due to stress- and grief-related overeating. I am using MyFitnessPal, once again, to track my eating. I have also been doing low-paced treadmill workouts in the evenings, though not every night. So far, my diet and exercise regime has gone really well, but sweets can still be tempting.</p>
<p>One new wrinkle in parenting that my family is dealing with is that my two-year-old son has recently developed separation anxiety, which is normal at his age. It has lead to a good deal of interrupted sleep late at night, when he wakes up and screams &ldquo;Mommy!&rdquo; My wife bears the brunt of it, though. He cries for her, but not for me. I am definitely second banana during these intermittent nighttime terrors.</p>

			 <p>I am going to try to post a journal entry now and then, because I have been neglecting my blog, and even <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my micro blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, for a long while now.</p>
<p>Today was a good day.</p>
<p>At work, I automated a data analysis process—and, just as importantly, the work paper creation process associated with it—that I will have to run about sixty times for one of my current projects. I am hopeful that all the effort will have been worth it when I can start using it next week.</p>
<p>I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->am<!-- raw HTML omitted --> stressing myself out a little bit while doing this work, though, because it would look like I spent the past day or two not moving forward on actual <!-- raw HTML omitted -->output<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at all, even though moving forward next week will be much more efficient. I always have to compare the time it will take me to automate parts of my work with the time it will take me to simply ground it out. Of course, both time estimates are usually just guesses for me, because most of my work is one-off project work, which is never repeated (at least not in the same way) on the next project. Luckily for me, I have the weekend off to forget about time and budget pressure for a couple days.</p>
<p>My daughter passed level 50 in Reading Eggs tonight, which she does at school and at home on her Chromebook. I am very proud of her. She has recently started working much harder at learning to read. My wife and I have been pushing her a little harder lately, too, and even hired her a reading tutor (who is super nice) to help her. The best thing to happen about it this week is that we are now all on the same page about, and saying aloud to each other, that increasing her reading skills is the top priority. It helps to be able to prioritize things.</p>
<p>My son probably will never need a reading tutor, but he will need to go to preschool in the fall, and my wife and I have to figure out how to pay for it. We have already started scaling back our expenses (mainly monthly subscriptions and dining out), but have not gone into full-on budget mode just yet. We have started talking about money again, which is good. We may start using YNAB again, but I don’t care for the price of their subscription.</p>
<p>I have been working on a huge update to one of my apps,  SwiftoDo Desktop, which is a todo.txt task list manager for the Mac. The current version is super old now, and I re-wrote it from scratch, basing the model code on the iOS version I have been working on for a couple years now. At this point, the new Mac version is even better than the iOS version, but it is still not ready for release. Based on the brief time I can work on it, late at night, I imagine I have several weeks to go before I can release it.</p>
<p>Also, today, I released a bug fix update to one of my other apps, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Simple Call Blocker<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I fixed a bug that made its call blocking extension not load for a lot of people. It turns out the problem had to do with calling an Apple API incorrectly—and I think the rules changed since I initially released the app, because it used to work without a problem. I had thought the bug was related to the app’s Core Data stack, which I had no way to fix, but it turned out to be something different. It feels good to fix that bug, and hopefully put a stop to all the customer emails I get about it.</p>

			 <p>As of today, my <em>second</em> 2017 iPad Pro has <em>also</em> developed backlight bleed on the bottom edge of the screen. (I have a charging stand, and use my iPad Pro almost like a desktop computer, so there is a definite &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; to it.) I got my first iPad Pro replaced for the same reason after about 11 months. The replacement&rsquo;s screen has been perfect for about nine months since then, but just started to exhibit the same problem today.</p>
<p>I wonder what is causing it. I hope it is not due to charging, pretty much exclusively, by the Smart Connector, because that&rsquo;s how I have it set up. Anyhow, I am stuck with it now for a good, long time, because it is out of warranty and was very, very expensive. Hopefully I can train myself to un-see it.</p>

<p>Hollow Knight developer Team Cherry surprised fans this morning by announcing a full sequel to 2017’s bug-filled metroidvania game, called Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hollow Knight is a cool, atmospheric, and thoughtfully crafted game. I&rsquo;m only a couple hours into it, and have just developed my skills enough to feel that it isn&rsquo;t too hard anymore. (I just beat a huge boss that I failed to default a half dozen times already.)
It is amazing to think that it was created by only two people. Hopefully the sequel will succeed and Team Cherry will continue making great games.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In 2001 I paid $14.99 for a lifetime account at <a href="https://vfemail.net">VFEmail</a>. I used it as my primary email host for a short time, as it was a pretty inexpensive IMAP email host back in the days when getting IMAP support outside of college or corporate email systems was quite rare. I stopped using it because it would go down from time to time, which is frustrating. I now use it only to get status emails sent by my home server (FreeNAS), which are relatively unimportant and anonymous. I keep thinking about using it more, because I love pure IMAP email, but now I am glad I did not.</p>
<p>I saw today that mail could not be fetched, and I found out that VFEmail was hacked, and everything for its US customers (including me, of course) has been destroyed. This is the message on the home page right now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>!!!ALERT!!!! Update Feb 11 2019
<a href="http://www.vfemail.net">www.vfemail.net</a> and mail.vfemail.net are currently unavailable.
We have suffered catastrophic destruction at the hands of a hacker, last seen as <a href="mailto:aktv@94.155.49.9">aktv@94.155.49.9</a>
This person has destroyed all data in the US, both primary and backup systems. We are working to recover what data we can.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is just devastating. Fortunately for me, I am not very much affected by the data loss, but I wonder how the other customers must feel.</p>
<p>VFEmail is a very small company. Originally it was just one guy. I feel really bad for him (or them, or whoever is running it now). I hope it can recover.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As is typical, much of that increase can be attributed to mobile gaming, which accounted for more than half of this per-device average. However, more substantial growth took place in the categories outside of gaming — including those categories where subscription-based apps tend to rule the top charts, the firm found.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I bet app spending is going to go up each year for the next few years, partly because people will spend less on hardware upgrades, and partly because software is becoming way more important than hardware in mobile now that the market has matured.</p>

			 <p>Sometimes, as a developer, I get stuck. This week, I have been stuck by some kind of endless loop or retain cycle that rears its head when I try to access a lazy-loaded class property within a subclass of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdocument">NSDocument</a> by <em>two</em> child view controllers. Everything worked flawlessly until I added that second view controller. I am at my wits end, and it&rsquo;s all my fault.</p>
<p>I have tried to access that property only synchronously via a dispatch queue. I have tried making the property <em>not</em> load lazily. I have tried a bunch of other workarounds over the past half-week, but the one that is working is to delay one of the view controller&rsquo;s accesses of that property by <em>zero</em> seconds (which moves the call to the next run loop). That is a hack, but necessary right now for me to continue developing the app.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m going to stick with my workaround until the new view controller is completed. After that, I probably have to rip up a bunch of clever code and find a simpler, more straightforward way to set everything up in my NSDocument subclass and its window controller.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Podcasting is a small industry, with an ad model that generated an estimated $315 million in 2017. Digital video ads, by comparison, generated $11.9 billion in the same year. But it is growing quickly, which makes it attractive to some platforms and publishers (including Vox Media) who are interested in tapping new revenue streams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the $315 million annual podcasting revenue estimate is low. I bet that advertisers are at the point where they all agree that podcasting&rsquo;s mix of old school, host-read ad reads, and new school analytics and targeting, are making it a really good deal for advertisers. I expect a lot more podcast network deals in the next year or two.</p>

			 <p>I think I enjoy music because I can listen to it while doing creative endeavors, such as writing or coding, and during most of my workday as well. I&rsquo;m not sure I like listening to music without doing something else, though, which is a little weird.</p>
<p>The most intensely focused music listening sessions of my life involved trying to learn to sing and/or play a part, which I no longer do, unfortunately. Now, most of my music listening happens during work, and a small, but usually more satisfying, amount happens while I am writing and coding on my own time late in the evening.</p>
<p>I think that listening to music while I am doing something else occupies that part of my mind that wants to wander and do something else, so that I can focus more closely on the task at hand.</p>

			 <p>If Elon Musk&rsquo;s Boring Company can somehow <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/elon-musk-unveils-travels-boring-142500567.html">bring down the costs of digging tunnels</a>, that would be fantastic. However, I am skeptical (emphasis is mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Tuesday, Musk put the total price tag for the finished segment at about $10 million, including the cost of excavation, internal infrastructure, lighting, ventilation, safety systems, communications and a track.</p>
<p>By comparison, he said, digging a mile of tunnel by &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; engineering methods costs up to $1 billion and takes three to six months to complete. Musk boasted of several cost-cutting innovations, including higher-power boring machines, digging narrower tunnels, speeding up dirt removal, and simultaneous excavation and reinforcement.</p>
<p><strong>However, the process he describes is how modern tunnel boring machines work. And he rented his Canadian-built boring machine from a Wisconsin tunneling company.</strong> He&rsquo;s using the Wisconsin company, Super Excavators, as consultants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is Musk just selling a wish and a dream here? I really hope not. I share his dream of solving traffic problems with underground mass-transit and personal-transit systems. We need more tunnels to route traffic away from (or at least beneath) city centers, and to open additional arteries into cities like New York City that are largely surrounded by, or bordered by, water.</p>
<p>I lived through all the cost overruns in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig">The Big Dig</a> in Boston. There were major deficiencies in planning, lots of cutting corners in terms of materials, design, and engineering that came back to bite them, and simple graft and stupidity at play. I am not sure that The Boring Company can really put a huge dent into all those things. A lot of them are <em>not</em>  technical problems that engineers can solve.</p>
<p>The Big Dig was a huge mess that was on our minds in Boston for years. The end result of that mess of a project, though, was a much nicer and more cohesive downtown Boston. This came about mostly by reclaiming land that had been used for highway overpasses, not because traffic and commute times were substantially reduced.</p>
<p>I think that if Elon Musk and his Boring Company could somehow decrease the costs of building tunnels, it would be far more important than building <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop">a new, sci-fi method of transportation</a>. I just don&rsquo;t think that he is actually doing it, even though he is telling everyone he is.</p>

<p>JOHN DESPISES HIS ALABAMA TOWN AND DECIDES TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. HE ASKS a reporter to investigate the son of a wealthy family who’s allegedly been bragging that he got away with murder. But then someone else ends up dead, sparking a nasty feud, a hunt for hidden treasure, and an unearthing of the mysteries of one man’s life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I listened to it first the day it came out, and actually listened to the entire thing in one stretch. Listening to it the first time felt like two, almost contradictory experiences: (1) reading a Victorian novel with a rollicking, unpredictable plot, and (2) listening to a carefully constructed classical piece, in which every element has purpose, and was purposely placed exactly where it is in the piece, so that it call comes together in the end to take you to new places.</p>

			 <p>I never knew that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/obituaries/evelyn-berezin-dead.html">Evelyn Berezin, who died on Saturday, invented the word processor</a>, but I am certainly in her debt and grateful that she did.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an age when computers were in their infancy and few women were involved in their development, Ms. Berezin (pronounced BEAR-a-zen) not only designed the first true word processor; in 1969, she was also a founder and the president of the Redactron Corporation, a tech start-up on Long Island that was the first company exclusively engaged in manufacturing and selling the revolutionary machines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suspect that sexism is the primary reason that her name was largely forgotten.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although Ms. Berezin was inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in Los Angeles in 2011, Matthew G. Kirschenbaum noted in “Track Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing” (2016), “she remains a relatively unknown and underappreciated figure, with nowhere near the stature of other women who played significant roles in computer science and the computer industry and have since been recognized by historians.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It probably did not help that her company&rsquo;s primary product was called the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102728582">Data Secretary</a>, which sounds incredibly antiquated now. (When was the last time we used the term secretary in the office to denote an &ldquo;administrative assistant”?)</p>
<p>If my daughter gets interested in computer science when she is older, I will definitely tell her about Evelyn Berezin in addition to the far more famous <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/adalovelace/">Ada Lovelace</a>.</p>

			 <p>I have been debating updating or not updating my home server to <a href="https://www.ixsystems.com/blog/library/freenas-11-2-release/">FreeNAS 11.2</a>. It is a big update for me because of this one change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Plugins and Jails backend has switched from warden to iocage and warden will no longer receive bug fixes. The new UI will automatically use iocage to create and manage Plugins and Jails. Users are encouraged to recreate any existing Plugins and Jails using the new UI to ensure that they are running the latest supported application versions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have one FreeBSD jail on my server with lots of customized software on it (most notably, a custom build of <a href="https://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a> <em>and</em> two standard FreeNAS plugins. It has run rock solid for 2-3 years, but I can&rsquo;t update it for various technical reasons, the underlying OS software is out of date, and rebuilding it will be a pain in the neck. I should probably wait until I can set aside a few hours, completely uninterrupted, to work on an upgrade—which probably won&rsquo;t happen until sometime in January. Part of my wants to just let it run, updated, until the server dies—even if the software is very out of date—because it is behind a firewall and is largely shielded from cyberattack. I just never have been able to live like that before.</p>

<p>There’s a “predisposition of humans to underestimate the time it takes to complete a thing” called the planning fallacy, which leads us to overcommit to opportunities at the expense of actually completing them, said Greg McKeown, author of “Essentialism” (one of my favorite books).</p>

<p>I needed to read an article like this today. I wish I had read such an article many years ago when I was in college.</p>
<p>My favorite technique to deal with being overwhelmed when I have overextended myself is to break down all the big tasks into tiny, tiny microtasks, and knock them off one by one. I use todo.txt to help keep track of it all.</p>

I think that, as a maker of <em>albums</em>, rather than singles, he hit his stride with <em>Storm Front</em> and that, <em>as an album</em>, <em>River of Dreams</em> is his best. His earlier albums have higher highs and lower lows, and don&rsquo;t hold together as well, in my opinion.

			 <p>One of my simple kitchen techniques to spruce up skinless, boneless chicken breasts is to throw a can of beans (cannellini or garbanzo) and some chicken broth on them, after searing the first side. I then cover them and simmer the chicken (typically in the oven) until it is done. I usually throw in some flour at the end, after taking the chicken out, to make a thick and creamy sauce.</p>

			 <p>I have just about every accessory I would imagine I would need for my (still) new Olympus OM-D EM10 Mark III camera, and all of them, except for the little carrying case it came with and my AmazonBasics tripod, fit into this little box. I never expected to buy so many lenses in such a short time (over a 4-month period). I was having so much fun shooting photos and expanding my camera&rsquo;s versatility. I tracked lens prices closely for months and bought each lens on a price dip; all in all I saved hundreds of dollars, compared to what it would have cost if I bought everything up front. Still, I spent way too much money this year on the camera; but at least I&rsquo;m almost done.</p>
<p>To keep everything neat and tidy, rather than lumped together in a little box, I think want some kind of padded, hardshell case for everything (such as a Pelican case). I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s worth the expense, though, because I don&rsquo;t think I would ever take it out of the house. I would continue to use the little case that came with the camera, which I love for its small size. It easily fits the camera and an extra lens or an external flash unit.</p>
<p>Once I sort the case situation out, I will be done with camera spending&hellip;at least for a few years.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I just discovered a versatile code (and text) editor for iOS called <a href="https://kodex.app">Kodex</a>. It is a free app with some pretty cool features:</p>
<ul>
<li>tight integration with the Files app</li>
<li>syntax highlighting for numerous languages (including Markdown)</li>
<li>multiple tabbed interface</li>
<li>a large assortment of hardware keyboard shortcuts, which you can customize the key bindings for</li>
<li>multiple cursor support (it&rsquo;s more rudimentary than Sublime Text&rsquo;s, which works with &ldquo;next word&rdquo; selection and the mouse, but it&rsquo;s a desktop-only app)</li>
<li>find/replace</li>
<li>find/replace with regEx</li>
<li>document minimap</li>
<li>a large assortment of themes and color schemes</li>
</ul>
<p>As nice as iOS is for text editing, especially if you have a hardware keyboard, it is hard to not see just how rudimentary most of its text editors are. There certainly is nothing like BBEdit or Sublime Text available on the platform (though Kodex is definitely aiming at Sublime Text, in its functionality).</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even think of any iOS text editor, other than Kodex (which I just discovered), that supports working with documents in multiple tabs.  (Apple should really just make a Safari-like tab bar controller a standard component. I know I would use it in my apps.) Even features that are common on the desktop, like find and replace, have only become common on iOS in the past year or so.</p>
<p>The best text editors on the platform (such as Drafts) are made with MarkDown and automation in mind, which is cool. But they are simplistic compared to what is available on the desktop. I would love it if something as fast and versatile as Sublime Text was released on iOS. I would probably pay a lot of money for it, too.</p>

			 <p>Most of my cooking and cleaning plans today were derailed when my kitchen sink detached from the granite countertop. I was soaking oven racks in scalding hot water, which I do every year around this time, but this time the weight and the heat were too much. The sink’s seaI failed, and the sink dropped about an inch on one side. I had to bail gallons of hot water out with a bowl. Luckily, I was able to get it repaired about an hour later, but I can’t use the sink again until sometime tomorrow. At least this didn’t happen to me on Thanksgiving!</p>

			 <p>I just ordered a new Chromebook for my daughter, based on Wirecutter&rsquo;s recommendation. It was a lot more expensive than I thought Chromebooks sold for, but I bought a decently-speced one for the battery life, screen, and RAM.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what to expect when I have to set it up. I am not even sure what a Chromebook <em>is</em> anymore, now that ChromeOS runs Android apps. I was an owner/user of the original Cr-48 (the prototype Chromebook from Google). I loved CromeOS when it was just a browser, but Google started to loose me when they adding windowing. Now that the Play Store is available, it just feels like another Windows-type platform. I would prefer the &ldquo;just a browser&rdquo; version I had before. Perhaps I will soon learn, once the Chromebook arrives, that it still can be run that way. I have been away from it for too long at this point to know.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m debating whether I should pay for <a href="https://www.anylist.com">AnyList</a> Pro again, just to use the Apple Watch app. I paid for a year a while back, and the Apple Watch app did not work very well. It kept crashing or getting killed, and would not stay in sync with my iPhone. None of the other paid features are interesting to me. I like the rest of the app&rsquo;s features, though, and I&rsquo;m getting the new Apple Watch in about a month, so maybe it will work this time. 🤷🏼‍♂️</p>

			 <p>⚾️ The last two Red Sox/Indians games felt like playoff baseball: close games, extra innings, nail-biting situations at the mound, etc. As a Red Sox fan, I hope my team can win a series against a team as good as the Indians (or, more importantly, the Yankees). Over the past week, I have been reminded of their <em>actual</em> playoff appearances the past two years, in which they lost in the divisional series.</p>

<p>If I add those features, I may as well rewrite the app’s UI, so that you have to create or open a file upon SwiftoDo’s launch. I would also have to rewrite how preferences are stored, so users could define different preferences for different files they open.</p>
<p>Those changes would, I think, necessitate dropping the offline support features that currently exist—namely manual sync mode, and the failsafes in place for when automatic sync fails (typically due to network unavailability). I am actually not sure how other document-based apps on iOS handle things when network connectivity is lost or unavailable. I would assume they simply cannot work without a constant network connection, because they cannot access their file, but I am not sure.</p>
<p>I do know that a task list is not a typical document-based app, like a text editor. Users typically want it to be always available, rather than dependent on a constantly-available network connection. Because I would rather not remove offline features from my app, and because I currently have very little time for app development, I do not plan any big changes to the app related to Files integration in the near future. When they do happen, I would expect that the UI of the app would be changed pretty significantly.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The next version of SwiftoDo Desktop will be compiled on the macOS 10.4 SDK, and will no longer support macOS versions lower than that. (If you are not going to upgrade to Mojave, you can continue to use the version of SwiftDo Desktop you are currently using, of course.)</p>
<p>Other than dark mode support, there are no new features. (Sorry!) Because of the under-the-hood changes, and the change in minimum system requirements, I am bumping the version number to 3.0.0, though. (Again, don’t get too excited, but be happy your app is being supported.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My long term plan is for SwiftoDo to resemble, and share tons of code with, the iPad version of SwiftoDo. The approach I would prefer to take would be to use the joint iOS/macOS framework that Apple said is coming next year. I will probably continue work on improving the iOS version’s codebase in preparation for eventual macOS support as well.</p>
<p>I am not sure if every user will want the iOS version on the desktop, but I know that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I<!-- raw HTML omitted --> would. I have considered releasing the next-generation version, whenever it is ready, under a new name (SwiftoDo Desktop 2, maybe) and SKU, so owners of the current SwiftoDo Desktop could continue to use it until it no longer functions on macOS. I have not decided exactly what I will do just yet.</p>
<p>I do not expect that anyone outside Apple will learn anything about Apple’s new framework until WWDC 2019, which will be held in June. What I learn at that time will have significant impact on the direction in which I take SwiftoDo Desktop.</p>

			 <p>Today felt like a good day to listen to a long vocal jazz playlist through my V Moda Crossfade Wireless 2. Their warm, somewhat bass-y sound signature works surprisingly well for that genre. I mostly think of them as great for rock and pop music, but they handled sparse arrangements of vocals (male and female), piano, bass, and drums (mostly brushwork) surprisingly well.</p>
<p>I had to use wired mode because the Bluetooth connection is too loud for me, even at the lowest volume setting, on my iOS devices. The Bluetooth volume level appears to be more sane when I use them with my Apple TV or Mac.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>After enjoying the Philips Revolution speaker dock for a while, I started to look for a better sounding iPod dock. I found that in the Altec Lansing M650, which is a 2.1 channel system (yes, stereo speakers plus a tiny, down-firing subwoofer!) in a compact, triangular case, with a 30-pin iPod/iPhone dock on a ledge in front.</p>
<p>I thought, and still think, that it sounds great. Its sound is warm, rich, and natural. While I wouldn’t consider the bass response to be very tight, or there to be any stereo separation at all, it does sound really nice, and can fill a small bedroom or a home office with a pleasant sound that I could listen to for hours on end.</p>
<p>I used one as my main desktop stereo system for a couple years while I worked from home. It replaced my Harmon Kardon Soundsticks, which sounded better for music, but were not as easy to connect to my iPhone. It sounds great for music, podcasts, and for TV—thanks to its line-in jack, I often plugged an iPad into it for better audio when watching baseball or Netflix. I liked this speaker so much that I bought another one for the kitchen, where it was a great base station for phone charging and playing internet radio for several years.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while this speaker sounds great, its 30-pin dock is poorly implemented. After several months, both speakers emit annoying static from the 30-pin connector unless the iPhone is seated just right. I think I’m the only one in my house who knows how to fiddle with it until the sound clears up. Plus, of course, the 30-pin connector was made obsolete by Apple’s change to the Lightning standard.</p>
<p>I still use both of my M650s in my children’s rooms to play white noise while they sleep, and occasional music while they are awake, through our old iPhone 4 and 4S. It has gotten increasingly difficult to seat an iPhone on them without getting static through the 30-pin connection, but it is still possible. However, because the 30-pin iPhones that drive them are old and barely work at this point (software-wise), these speakers’ days as iPhone docks are numbered. They have a line-in jack in the back, however, and are prime candidates to pair with an Amazon Echo Dot (or something similar) sometime in the future.</p>

			 <p>The iPod had a monumental impact on how people listened to music. Not only did it turn people onto digital music downloads, rather than CDs, better than any preceding product; it also made listening to playlists and to shuffled music simple and extremely popular. The iPod’s 30-pin connector had a huge impact on home speaker systems as well. Suddenly, it became the default connection option for a bevy of home speakers. In stores, many speaker systems were repealed by iPod speaker docks.</p>
<p>While I had iPods since the first iPod Mini was released, shortly after I got married, I got an iPod Touch. It came for for free with my wife’s first MacBook Pro, and she had no interest in it. Of course, as a non-iPhone-owner, I found the iPod Touch to be an incredible upgrade from my iPod Nano. Around the same time, I got my first iPod speaker dock for free as well, in exchange for writing a review. It was a Philips Revolution speaker dock that looked somewhat like a boombox, could be driven by a bunch of D-cells or a power cord, and had a rotating dock that could accommodate (in portrait or in landscape mode) every iPod created to date and the first generation iPhone.</p>
<p>For sound, it was perfectly adequate. I liked it a lot at the time, but I thought of it like a boombox rather than a room-filling speaker system. It lacked a subwoofer, and thus had lackluster bass, but it was small, battery powered, and brought music into places in our apartment that it previously didn’t reach. My wife and I enjoyed using it with the iPod Touch for streaming music—mainly Pandora or streaming radio from WNYC—in the dining room while we ate dinner. I really enjoyed using it for background music during meals or for news radio, for which having the richest and best audio quality was not terribly important.</p>
<p>In the same way that my computer, once I got a CD-ROM drive, supplanted the stereo system as my main music player, this speaker system solidified the iPod’s (and later the iPhone’s) prime position as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the<!-- raw HTML omitted --> source for music in my house. It also got me into the habit of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->streaming<!-- raw HTML omitted --> audio into the house, rather than only playing previously downloaded (or ripped) music. My wife and I used it in our kitchen for years to stream WNYC news and music. When the iPhone changed from the 30-pin connector to the Lightning connector however, this speaker dock’s days were numbered. And when that original iPod Touch’s software support was dropped by Apple, this speaker dock’s days were done.</p>

			 <p>In my mid 20s, I decided to move from boring (but nice) suburban Connecticut back to the Boston area where I went to college. It was a chance to reinvent myself, which is something I really needed to do at the time.</p>
<p>In the process, I replaced a lot of my belongings—cheap things or hand-me-downs that I had since my college days—with newer, better versions. I replaced nearly everything I cooked with and ate with: dishes, pots and pans, and small appliances. I bought a new wardrobe and got rid of my ratty old T-shirts and jeans. I traded up from a slow and struggling Dell tower PC to a sleek, fast, white MacBook (my first Mac!). I also traded up from my old, busted Altec Lansing computer speakers to the cool, futuristic Harman Kardon Soundsticks II that I saw in the Apple Store.</p>
<p>The Soundsticks’ clear plastic construction made them almost invisible. Their clear, light-up subwoofer looked like a bioluminescent jellyfish floating atop the tangle of wires under my desk. Their capacitive touch volume control was futuristic, too, but really hard to control; I mainly relied on my MacBook’s volume control instead.</p>
<p>In my cool, urban apartment, I played music through these cool, stylish speakers for hours and hours each day as I worked on my new MacBook (and on my work laptop, side-by-side). They sounded much better than my prior Altec Lansing computer speakers, but mostly they just looked better. I found that, at loud volumes, they didn’t really fill the room how I would have liked them, but I rarely played them that loud anyway, considering they were sitting on the desk I was working at.</p>
<p>During this time, I stopped buying CDs and started buying music online. I got into indie rock very heavily, mainly because I could get their tracks at great prices (25 cents per track) though eMusic. I first heard Okkervil River, Spoon, The Avett Brothers, The Apples in Stereo, Bright Eyes, Rilo Kily, Rainer Maria, and many, many other artists through these speakers.</p>
<p>I happily used these speakers for five years or so—even after moving from my hip, urban apartment to the suburban house I live in now—but I eventually tired of the mess their wires made atop and beneath my desk, and moved them into basement storage. Someday I hope to find another use for them, perhaps as a bookshelf system driven by a Raspberry Pi, but I would need to figure out a way to hide all the wires, so the great looks of these speakers shine through.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Over winter break, during my sophomore year in college, I bought my first <!-- raw HTML omitted -->new<!-- raw HTML omitted --> computer: a beige Dell tower with an Intel 486 processor. When pricing out systems—and this was done over the phone back then, rather than over the internet, because my parents did not have internet access in 1997—I configured nearly identical systems from Gateway and Dell at the same price. The only difference between them was in the peripherals: the Gateway came with a 19-inch monitor, rather than a 17-inch monitor, and the Dell came with a USB-connected, 2.1 channel Altec Lansing speaker setup. I bought the Dell, to get the better speakers.</p>
<p>At the time, I thought the trade-off was completely worth it. The speakers were tiny, stylish, had some fancy USB connectivity (USB was brand new then!), and came with a subwoofer, which I had never had before. The subwoofer added a new dimension to my music that I had never experienced before. It could shake the room if I wanted that, or just add some sub-bass dimension to the music. Its presence inspired me to pair this speaker set with my old, 2-channel Altec Lansing computer speakers, to create a 4.1 channel setup that I used to watch DVDs in my dorm room in 1999 and 2000. I had to upgrade my sound card to a Sound Blaster Audigy to get that to work. (I think that is the last dedicated sound card I ever bought!)</p>
<p>Their USB connection was not all I had hoped for, however. It did not carry the audio signal; it only allowed you to control the volume and EQ from a Windows menu bar application. It was pretty sophisticated for the time, but it was superfluous, and, I discovered after a year or so, the drivers that made it work caused Windows to crash all the time. So I disabled the USB feature and continued to use them for about 10 years, through college, grad school, and beyond. Eventually they wore out so badly they could no longer play at a proper volume. By that point, though, I had moved onto using an iPod for most of my music playback.</p>

			 <p>I got my first computer when I was in seventh grade. It was an IBM AT/XT that we upgraded several times over the years. By the time I was in high school, my dad bought me a SoundBlaster sound card and some 6-inch computer speakers. I actually do not remember who made them: it was either JBL, Creative, or Altec Lansing. What I do remember is that they were the generic beige color of all PC hardware of the era, the right speaker had knobs for balance and volume, and, as a pair, they could go very, very loud. No one else I came across had computer speakers that large or that loud.</p>
<p>Sound quality-wise, however, they were not great. Back then, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was still rare to hear any sounds at all coming out of a computer. It was enough to be able to hear the beeps and blips coming from my DOS-based productivity software and games.</p>
<p>Due to lackluster sound quality, and the fact that CD-ROM drives were too expensive for me to buy until the mid 1990s, these computer speakers never replaced my CD system’s speakers as my main playback system. They are important to me, however, because they enabled me, for the first time, to use the computer to record and mix music.</p>

			 <p>A week before I left for college I bought a Sony boombox to use as a bookshelf stereo. It had detachable speakers, so you could actually achieve stereo separation, and, of course, “mega bass”, which was pretty much mandatory for good sound in such small speakers.</p>
<p>I chose this particular model because it had an analog 3-band equalizer, as opposed to several genre-specific settings; I relied on the EQ to pick out guitar and bass parts I would transcribe. As a bonus, it didn’t have a crazy light show like the many of the other boomboxes on sale in 1996.</p>
<p>I don’t remember very well how it sounded, to be honest, because I wasn’t able to use it that much. My freshman year roommate and I did not share musical tastes, so I had to play my music through my computer using headphones. (My computer’s CD-ROM drive actually had a dedicated “play” button and its own headphone jack.) I didn’t realize it at the time, but all those hours listening to music over headphones (the cheapest headphones possible, I’d say) in my dorm room were the very beginning of my headphone-centric music listening preferences.</p>

			 <p>My parents bought me my first CD player at the JC Penney Outlet. It was a damaged, open-box, no-name system that resembled a single, tall unit. It contained, from top to bottom, a turntable (though the clear cover was broken off and missing), an AM/FM radio, a five band equalizer, a dual deck cassette, and a single cd player at the bottom. The only reason I asked for it, and thought my family could afford it, was because it was damaged and was being sold at a steep discount. I also told my parents I would listen to classical music on it, which was my intent, but didn’t actually happen too often.</p>
<p>It came with two bookshelf speakers with RCA inputs that plugged in the rear, that I set up about ten feet away from the receiver. I couldn’t tell you how good or bad the sound was. All I knew at the time is that it was amazing compared to what I had at the time: my mom’s 20-year-old transistor radio, and a cheap, toy-like boombox with a dual cassette deck. The most important upgrade, of course, was upgrading from records and tapes to CDs. CDs didn’t have tape hiss, had high dynamic range, and didn’t wear out over time or get eaten by the plater sometimes.</p>
<p>I blasted music through this no-name system for hundreds of hours through middle school and high school. I measured my school papers by how many album listens it took to write them. I used it to practice singing, to transcribe songs with my guitar, to play back 4-track recordings, to lie back on my bed with CD liner notes while my favorite new song played on repeat.</p>
<p>I amassed an enormous CD collection, mostly through the Columbia House and BMG Music clubs, and partly through weekly trips to my local record store (which is long gone now).</p>
<p>Now that I’m a parent, I am amazed that all my loud music playing didn’t drive my parents crazy. They never complained to me about my music blasting from 3 PM to 10 PM every day. My kids are too little to listen to music on their own, but I’m already thinking about which headphones to get them, so we can all coexist in the house.</p>
<p>I have no idea where this system went or who made it, but, based on it being my first CD player, it is probably the most important speaker system I have ever owned.</p>

			 <p>I love music, and I love headphones, but, oddly enough, I have no special love for speakers. The reason, I suppose, is that, since I was a broke teenager living with my parents, I have never had the opportunity to listen to loud, room-filling music at my home. Roommates, sleeping children, and close neighbors have always prevented it. That said, my love of music has always depended on speakers, and, as I got older, they got a little better over the years.</p>
<p>I’m going to publish a short series of posts about the various speaker systems I’ve had over the years. After that, I will post a short series of posts about all the headphones I’ve had, and loved, over the years, as well.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I took a break from SwiftoDo development to build a new app, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Simple Call Blocker<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->posted about<!-- raw HTML omitted --> earlier this week. Building it was a fun diversion, and I learned a lot in the process, too. If you’re reading this, you’re probably wondering what’s up with SwiftoDo, however. I have been working on it this summer, too.</p>
<p>Since this spring, I have been promising everyone that I’m working on iOS 11+ Files app integration. This feature will let SwiftoDo open files from any cloud service provider that ties into the iOS 11+ Files app. That includes Dropbox, Box, NextCloud, OneDrive, Google Drive, and many others. Adding additional data providers to SwiftoDo has been a long time coming.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I designed SwiftoDo data providers to be plugins that could be swapped out, which would allow me to support numerous cloud storage providers. I have had so much trouble getting the Dropbox data provider to be solid and stable, however, that I was loath to create more data providers. My thinking was that I was liable to cause more problems for my users (and myself!) than I would solve. Therefore, I concentrated on fixing up the Dropbox data provider code, which is now, after three or four rewrites, pretty solid.</p>
<p>(The Dropbox data provider code has always <!-- raw HTML omitted -->worked<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but it had a rare but nasty crashing bug for some time, and some issues related to stability, ability to handle spotty network connections, and ability to handle, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gracefully<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Dropbox “rate limit exceeded” API responses.)</p>
<p>iOS 11’s Files app, which I did not anticipate being available when I first wrote SwiftoDo, obviates the need for additional “native” data providers. I just wasn’t sure if SwiftoDo would be able to tie into it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have been under the impression that integrating with the Files app would require a rewrite of major sections of the app, or would simply not work well due to sandboxing limitations. I thought this because all Files-based iOS apps that I have used follow Apple’s “Document-based app” template very closely: Think “Microsoft Word” rather than “Reminders” in terms of user interaction patterns. They open to a file browser, you open a document (typically a single document), work on the document, save it (automatically), and close the app. The life cycle of a document is fairly limited: after the app is killed, your file is closed and does not reopen on load. Most of these apps don’t work offline at all, unless you’re working with local-only files, because they can’t open your file.</p>
<p>In contrast, SwiftoDo works a lot differently. It manages your task list locally and syncs it to an external file. It lets you archive completed tasks to a second external file. It keeps the opening and choosing of files down to a minimum. Most users set up their todo.txt and archive files once and never touch those settings again. It lets you work offline (primarily in “manual sync mode”, but also when the network is unavailable) and sync your changes to the cloud on demand.</p>
<p>Integrating SwiftoDo with the Files app, without giving up anything, seemed like it might be a considerable challenge.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To my surprise, implementing a “Files” data provider has not been as challenging as I thought it would be. Accessing documents via the iOS document picker and restoring them after the app is killed, via secure bookmarks, is actually pretty easy. It took me only a couple hours to set up a data provider that would upload and download to iCloud Drive and even Dropbox through the Files app.</p>
<p>That is not nearly enough to ship the feature, though. There are still some issues regarding stability and error handling that I have to work through.</p>
<p>Adding this feature also prompted me to display file names in Settings (rather than 2 screens deep in Settings) and atop the task list in the main view.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After I finish the Files data provider work, and the new Xcode and iOS versions are officially released, I plan to build SwiftoDo on the iOS 12 SDK and drop iOS 10 support. I’ve been thinking of bumping the version number to 3.0 at that point, to mark the change in iOS compatibility.</p>
<p>I will also consider the future of Files integration in SwiftoDo. It temping for me to remove the entire “data provider” layer and just make SwiftoDo a normal iOS document-based app. That would be a big deal, and I would not make that change unless I understood fully what that would mean for users. I also have to consider how long I will continue to support the existing Dropbox data provider, as it will be somewhat redundant.</p>
<p>After that, I will have the opportunity to simplify the codebase quite a bit. It is tempting for me to rewrite some or all of the UI layer, to incorporate the new techniques I have learned since coding version 2, over a year ago. Any changes to the UI code will probably be related to new features or a minor redesign of the sorting/filtering interface that I have been thinking about.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/introducing-simple-call.html">Introducing: Simple Call Blocker</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Recently I released a new iOS app: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Simple Call Blocker<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>It is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->free<!-- raw HTML omitted --> utility that lets you block unwanted calls to your iPhone. Unlike most of the call blockers on iOS, it allows you to block whole ranges of numbers, such as your phone number’s extension, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for free<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You may also <!-- raw HTML omitted -->whitelist<!-- raw HTML omitted --> numbers, ranges of numbers, or all your contacts’ phone numbers, so that they will not be blocked by this app, even if they are in the blacklist.</p>
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Simple Call Blocker website<!-- raw HTML omitted --> explains it in more detail.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I wanted to write a small, relatively simple app that would allow me to explore the following things:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Overall, the app was a lot of fun to write. It took me about a month in my after-hours “free time” to create. The overall process has made me a better iOS app developer. I’m excited to bring forward the skills and concepts I developed on this project to future work.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I started getting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->neighbor spam calls<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, so I downloaded nearly all the iOS call blocking apps I could find. There were fewer such apps than I thought there would be, all of them seemed amateurish in some way or another, and all of them (as of a month ago) required an in-app purchase or a subscription to block my neighborhood exchange. I wasn’t willing to pay for that feature in any of the apps that I tried, because all of those apps weren’t that good. Plus, blocking an exchange, or a continuous range of numbers, is pretty trivial, so I thought I could create an app that did that, and offer it for free to people.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>No. It is well-written and works as well as iOS’s Call Directory extensions allow it to. It has a rough edge or two, though, in that it reloads its directory extension and reports success or errors back to the users, rather than trying to prevent the user from ever encountering an error from being reported by the directory extension loading process.</p>
<p>What that means is that you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ask Simple Call Blocker to block more numbers that iOS will allow—there is an undocumented limit—and the app has to wait for the CallKit Directory Extension’s load process to report success or failure before it can tell the user what is going on. I decided not to try to impose limits on how many numbers could be blacklisted, but instead allow the app to report the Directory Extension’s errors, if any, back to the user. I figure that the undocumented maximum number of blocked phone numbers probably is dependent on whatever hardware is in your phone, and probably is increasing in every new iPhone model.</p>
<p>The Simple Call Blocker directory extension is coded extremely conservatively, and it optimized for very low RAM and system usage. If iOS cannot load it, it is because the user put too many numbers in the blacklist, or because it is still loading numbers from a prior attempt.</p>
<p>Releasing the app for free, I think, makes it OK that it may not work exactly as users expect it to.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I plan to support it through various iOS releases, but otherwise not improve it too much. After all, it is a free app.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Go ahead and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->download the app in the iOS App Store<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (it’s free!), and check out the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FAQ<!-- raw HTML omitted --> online.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->DON’T FEED THE TROLLS, AND OTHER HIDEOUS LIES<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; is a great article by &ldquo;Film Crit Hulk&rdquo; on our collective failure to respond properly to internet trolling culture.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think that there is a fundamental misunderstanding of trolling. It isn&rsquo;t a joke. It isn&rsquo;t done <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for the lulz<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a joke&rdquo; is an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->obvious cover<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for bad behavior.</p>
<p>It reminds me of an episode from my youth. In high school I had a friend who had a stash of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Playboy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> magazines that he got (I think) from an older brother. Somehow we found out about them, demanded to see them, and teased him about them as we thumbed through them together. &ldquo;Why do you have these&rdquo; we would ask, teasingly, knowing full well why he had them. My friend&rsquo;s face would grow bright red and we would stammer: &ldquo;because they&rsquo;re so funny&rdquo;. When pressed, he would double down on it: he would swear, up and down, that he had them because they were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hilarious<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Sure they were.</p>
<p>It puzzles me, why we act as if it&rsquo;s even possible that verbal abuse on the internet is &ldquo;just a joke&rdquo;. A decent response to &ldquo;it was just a joke&rdquo; is &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter&rdquo;.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the online world, people who violate community standards should be banned from those communities. Gathering spaces online are not public spaces: almost all of them are owned by private companies or individuals. Freedom of speech is up to the owner of the space; the level of discourse there directly reflect&rsquo;s the owner as well. By law, they might not be legally responsible for the content of their site, but they are ethically and morally responsible for it, regardless. Owning and running a site where terrible things happen should be a black mark on a company’s or a person’s reputation—and that should matter.</p>
<p>It would be nice if people started to care about reputation again, and if bad reputations led to lower profits and lower stature in the global community. Sadly, we are in a time, right now, where that does not seem to be the case.</p>

		<a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2018/07/10/recommitting-to-pinboard.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-07-10 22:00:00 -0500">Jul 10, 2018</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’m re-committing to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pinboard<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, after a year or more away from it. I’m happy with what I am doing now, and thought I would document it in case anyone else wanted help understanding how to use the Pinboard effectively, especially if their usage lapsed, as mine did.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Pinboard is an “antisocial” cloud bookmarking service. You can keep all your bookmarks there and use its barebones website or third party apps and browser extensions, all using an open API, to access them. It’s a paid service, run by a single person, with a clear and straightforward business model. When I signed up, I pre-paid for ten years of service. Part of my impetus for using it again now, after having abandoned it for, well, nothing, is the sunk-cost fallacy. The other, more important part of that impetus is that I really like the simplicity and speed of Pinboard, and I like the Pinboard iOS client I use, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pinner<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I use it for three things:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Number 3 used to be the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->primary<!-- raw HTML omitted --> purpose of Pinboard to me. I had signed up as part of an effort to get replace Pocket with something more privacy focused. After many years of using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pocket<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (formerly “Read It Later”) to collect articles I was interested in from the huge stream of RSS feeds I parsed every day, I wanted a change. Primarily, this was because I became uncomfortable with Pocket’s business model: Why was it free? How did they really make money? What were they doing will all the data they collected on me?</p>
<p>I also wasn’t crazy about some of the UI changes made to Pocket over the years. I wanted more control over the reading experience, too, which is something that using a web service with an open API would give me. It helps that, at the time, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Safari’s Reader View<!-- raw HTML omitted --> debuted, and I thought it was fantastic.</p>
<p>I was pretty obsessive about channeling all the articles I read through Pinboard, so I had a one-way workflow from discovery to reading to marking read. I never deleted anything from Pinboard, either. I thought I wanted a history of all the articles I ever read, in case I wanted to search through that history later. (Of course, I never did that.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I stopped using Pinboard for three main reasons:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Overall, Pinboard became a graveyard for links I didn’t actually want to read. Instead of a useful resource, it was a junk pile full of stale content.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I took the following steps to return Pinboard to a useful utility for me:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I developed a new workflow to work with Pinboard, so I don’t end up with a mess of useless bookmarks again. Honestly, though, calling it a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->workflow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is an exaggeration. I basically decided to manage Pinboard with a simple set of rules.</p>
<p>I will continue to use Pinboard both for permanent bookmarks, which mostly involve specific technical documentation about Swift and iOS development, and for a read-it-later service, which are bookmarks I want to keep around temporarily, some of which I plan to keep long term.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So far this workflow has been working well for me. I collect “read later” bookmarks throughout the day, read through them in the evening, and delete almost all of them at the end of the day. My Pinboard bookmarks list is much smaller than before, but contains only good stuff that I want to act on, either now or later.</p>

		<a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2018/06/06/what-would-make.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-06-06 22:00:00 -0500">Jun 6, 2018</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I love the Apple Watch. I didn&rsquo;t always, though. When I first tried on a Series 0, a couple weeks before it was released, I quickly made the decision not to buy one. I thought it was too expensive and that it was not immersive enough. I had been expecting an iPhone for the wrist; what it was instead was a wristwatch with some extras. Six months later, however, I relented and bought one, mostly because Target was offering the Space Gray Sport model at a deep discount, and I wanted to pick a holiday gift for myself that my family members could chip in for.</p>
<p>I quickly grew to love the Apple Watch, despite its slow speed and lack of viable third-party applications. The first-party Apple Watch applications alone—such as Messages, Workouts, and Weather—pleased me very much. Caller ID on my watch was great for avoiding telemarketing calls at dinner. Something as simple as having the temperature always available on my watch face far more useful than I had anticipated.</p>
<p>I have a Series 1 now because my Series 0&rsquo;s screen popped off due to battery swelling after almost two years. Apple covered it under an extended warranty and sent me a Series 1 for free. The Series 1 is much faster than the Series 0, and is not going to be obsoleted by Watch OS 5 in the fall. Still, it isn&rsquo;t as fast, and consequently as useful, as the Series 3. I fully expect a new Apple Watch model to be released later this year, which will be even faster.</p>
<p>If I still had the Series 0, I had planned to upgrade this year, for increased performance alone. Now that I have the Series 1, I am not so sure. My Series 1 has great battery life, but is starting to show performance problems. Workouts, for example, take a long time to start. Third party apps are still, largely, useless for me, for the same reason. Despite these problems, most of the features of the Apple Watch are still working just fine for me.</p>
<p>The main feature that would tempt me to upgrade, at this point, would be new or better health monitoring features. The idea that the watch could save my life, by monitoring for irregular heartbeats, is very compelling to me. I would welcome and pay for any additional features in that area. If they are confined to newer hardware, I would definitely upgrade to get them. I care more about that sort of thing than I do about increased speed, cellular or GPS connectivity, or (if the rumors are true) a larger display area.</p>

<p>I like it. The high school setting and girl-centric plot, though not the music, remind me a lot of &ldquo;Bring It On&rdquo;, which is another musical that has a fantastic cast album and works a lot better than you would think.

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Recently, with the help of someone on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Micro.blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and Apple Music, I have turned my family on to the music of Justin Roberts. His band plays children’s music in a power pop style. His music is really catchy, and his lyrics are wry, funny, very kid-friendly (my daughter sings them all the time), and sometimes also play to the parents on emotional level as well.</p>
<p>My favorite Justin Roberts song, by far, is “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Recess<!-- raw HTML omitted -->”. Like the best power pop songs, this song has more hooks and ideas in it than most albums do. The lyrics are cleverly and consistently written from the point of view of a bored kid stuck in a classroom, waiting for the recess bell to ring:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the second and third pre-chorus endings, the lyrics expand out beyond the tedium of the elementary school classroom to the wonder of the outside world:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That last line resonates powerfully with me. Seeing the beauty in this world is something children do naturally. I think we forget how to, as we get older, and our knowledge of history and current events expands, and our experience of life evolves from dreaming of what our lives might be to actually living them day-to-day. Our dreams get smaller and more finite as time passes. As we get older still, we relearn to see the beauty, in a different way—with a wonder that is tinged with sadness. As an adult, I see that the splendor and joy of the world is counterbalanced by its disappointments and horrors.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The line “There is more beauty in this world than you can guess” always makes me think of the contrasting sentiment expressed in the poem <!-- raw HTML omitted -->“Good Bones” by Maggie Smith<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Life is short, though I keep this from my children.
Life is short, and I’ve shortened mine
in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,
a thousand deliciously ill-advised ways
I’ll keep from my children. The world is at least
fifty percent terrible, and that’s a conservative
estimate, though I keep this from my children.
For every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.
For every loved child, a child broken, bagged,
sunk in a lake. Life is short and the world
is at least half terrible, and for every kind
stranger, there is one who would break you,
though I keep this from my children. I am trying
to sell them the world. Any decent realtor,
walking you through a real shithole, chirps on
about good bones: This place could be beautiful,
right? You could make this place beautiful.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is a profoundly powerful poem that I read in college and have never forgotten. As an adult and a parent, I return to it often. It has always made me feel, in some way, like a teenager who concludes, upon first entering the adult world, that I have been sold a bill of goods: nothing is as nice or easy or fair as my parents and mentors (and, let’s face it, TV and movies) told me it would be. This poem distills all the disappointment and disillusionment that experience and maturity bring into seventeen simple and somewhat humorous lines. I love how it ends on a note that is somehow both cynical and hopeful: “You could make this place beautiful.”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It’s my job, as a parent, to sell the world to my children. I want to tell them the good—now, while they are young—and the bad—later, when they are older. In both times, now and later, I have to remember that Justin Roberts and Maggie Smith are both right about the world. It contains all the beauty that has any meaning. It also contains all the horrors that have ever befell anyone. The most important thing I have to teach my children is that they can make it better—they just have to try, even after the veil of childhood innocence has fallen, and they see the world for what it really is.</p>

			 <p>WWDC is in a little more than two weeks. As a hobbyist developer, I don’t go to big, expensive conferences 3,000 miles from my home. But I do eagerly await it each year. Last year I was so excited about it that I went as far as calling it “nerd Christmas”. This year, though, I’m <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> looking forward to the keynote, the new APIs, the betas, and so on.</p>
<p>There have been no substantive leaks about what will be announced, and no one’s predictions so far have been that compelling. That’s in stark contrast to last year, when I practically knew what iOS 11 would bring to the iPad, based on rumors and speculation. This year, the most exciting leak we got is that a cross-platform macOS/iOS development framework <!-- raw HTML omitted -->will not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> be announced this year.</p>
<p>As a user and a fan, I basically want Apple to announce a rebuilding year. iOS 12 should be a maintenance release. They can make their software faster and more stable. They can make Siri <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a lot<!-- raw HTML omitted --> better. They can fix bugs. Other than that, I don’t want a radical UI overhauls of any of their operating systems (as if the latter would ever happen). On the hardware side, I’d love to see them refresh the MacBook Pro and iPhone SE sometime this year, but my expectations for an announcement at WWDC are very low.</p>
<p>As a developer, I don’t really want to worry about having to support new frameworks or features. Just upgrading from one iOS framework to the next one can sometimes take days of work before all the kinks are worked out. Even upgrading Xcode to a new major version is, as a Swift developer at least, a little scary. New versions of Xcode have not been stable or bug-free for me since Xcode 8 was released. The recently released Xcode 9.3.1 has been working really well for me, though, and I’m loath to give it up anytime soon. I’d love WWDC to be about Apple fixing the numerous, relatively minor, UIKit bugs that I’ve had to work around, but past history leads me to believe that iOS 12 will just have another set of odd bugs to work around.</p>

I am a huge fan of the band&rsquo;s 2005-2008 work, a trifecta of literate rock albums: <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/black-sheep-boy-10th-anniversary-edition/1036936862">Black Sheep Boy</a></em>, <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-stand-ins/543561172">The Stand Ins</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-stage-names-bonus-track-version/453256340">The Stage Names</a></em>. Each of these albums is a staggering artistic achievement; each song on them is an evocative short story with enough weight, depth, and maturity to reward repeated listenings.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t spent nearly as many hours listening to their work since then, which which includes <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-silver-gymnasium/977288852">The Silver Gymnasium</a></em> and <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/away/1113050258">Away</a></em>. This, more recent, period is characterized by a darker, more somber tone. It&rsquo;s easy to imagine the band&rsquo;s frontman, and only consistent member now, Will Sheff, slowing down, looking back on life, and looking far forward to his eventual death. That&rsquo;s way heavier stuff than what I normally listen to, but not <em>too</em> heavy to be enjoyable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On first listen, Minchin&rsquo;s melodies are captivating. They are undeniably more poppy than his dark, moody, and undulating score for MATILDA; however, it&rsquo;s obvious that he has written each of these compositions with the same consideration and care that he did with MATILDA. Despite the more simplistic sounding and pop aural soundscape, the melodies are intricately layered showing an artistry and skill that is not apparent in one listening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope Tim Minchin keeps writing musicals. His music and lyrics for his prior show, <em>Matilda</em>, are a masterpiece. (Listen to the London cast recording over the Broadway one if you can; it is a <em>far</em> better performance, though it is missing some of Matilda&rsquo;s monologues.) &ldquo;Groundhog Day&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t quite rank as a masterpiece in my book, but it is really, really good.</p>

			 <p>Earlier this year, I completed reading <em><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One">Ready Player One</a></em> by Ernest Cline. It was the first novel that I had read in a while, as I have been reading mostly nonfiction in recent years. I discovered the book from an <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/triangulation/episodes/322">episode of the “Triangulation” podcast in which Leo Laporte interviewed author Andy Weir</a>, who enthusiastically recommended the book.</p>
<p>Overall, I enjoyed the book. The prose is efficient and the pacing is swift. I thought it started out strong, and I liked the world building and the build-up of suspense in the early chapters. After a while, though, I tired of all the 1980s video game and movie references, and wanted the book to end. While I was about three quarters through the book, I referred to it as “the reading equivalent to watching somebody else play video games”. For me, the stakes felt too low, and the characterizations were too thin, to make a lasting impression. Still, I had fun reading it, at least most of the way through.</p>

Donald Knuth called it “the root of all evil”.

<p>I’m at an age now where I have everything I would ever want. But…everything I have could still be a little bit better. To wit:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>These few things are some of my material obsessions. What they have in common, for me, is that they have all been satisfied by things I already own, upgrading to newer or better versions would cost a lot of money (way more than anyone would spend in a gift for me), and the upgrade would be only marginally better than what I have, so I’m not sure if it would even make me happy.</p>

<p>Someday, my headphones will break, my keyboards won’t be compatible with my computers, my server won’t support the OS I want to run, and Apple won’t support my hardware anymore. That’s when I will upgrade these things—after I have extracted every bit of their value. Until then, I will just daydream about, and feel a little guilty about obsessing about, premature optimization.</p>

<p>Calling yourself an audiophile is a little like calling yourself a rube and not realizing it. That’s because being an audiophile is a hobby marked far more by spending large amounts of money on speakers (I include headphones here, of course)—speakers that sound only a tiny bit better than much less expensive speakers, than on anything else. At worst, it’s conspicuous consumption wrapped in a superiority complex, or an obsession that has gotten embarrassingly expensive. At best, however, it’s about finding new ways to enjoy the music you love, enjoying that music an awful lot with the equipment you have, while keeping a level head about your budget and equipment’s price-to-performance ratio.</p>
<p>I, of course, include myself in the latter camp. I’ve spent a good amount of money on headphones at this point, but I am mostly interested in extracting as much value out of them—as many listening hours and as much enjoyment as possible—rather than on what the next better set of headphones will be.</p>

<p>I never thought I was missing anything when I listened to everything through $10 Sony earbuds that I would have to replace every three months or so. When I got my first pair of over-ear headphones, though, it opened a new world for me. I heard details in the music I had never noticed before. The soundstage sounded wider. Instruments sounded more distinct, realistic, and separate from each other than I had ever heard before. Drumbeats had a more visceral impact, due to headphone drivers being much larger than those I was used to. On a more basic level, the over-ear headphones had better isolation than the earbuds did, blocking out outside noise, allowing me hear my music even better. Listening to music, something I loved already, became more fun and more exciting than ever before.</p>
<p>Those first over-ear headphones, which I credit for opening my eyes to the benefits of higher-end gear, were nothing special. They were a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SteelSeries 7H<!-- raw HTML omitted --> gaming headset, which I received for free in exchange for writing a review. At the time, it was a $130 headset; today they are being sold for $21, proving that you don’t have to spend outrageous amounts of money to get better audio quality. I’m not saying they are the best headphone ever. Compared to Apple and Sony earbuds, though, they sound fantastic. I never would have realized it, if I hadn’t picked them up.</p>
<p>The headphones I’m wearing right now cost a lot more than those SteelSeries cans, and they reveal details in the music that the SteelSeries cannot. They are objectively better. But the much cheaper headphones are still <!-- raw HTML omitted -->just fine<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and sound way better than whatever free pack-ins you got with your smartphone. I enjoyed them and would probably still be using them to this day if they had not broken. (Headphone durability is a separate issue from sound quality, and can be worth spending more money on.)</p>
<p>The jump from $10 headphones to $130 headphones was definitely worth it to me. Each jump up in price I have made since then was worth it, too. (I didn’t get <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all<!-- raw HTML omitted --> my headphones for free!) If I hadn’t tried headphones better than the ones I was used to, I never would have known that better sound was even possible.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After a certain dollar amount, each additional dollar spent on audio equipment buys you less and less of an improvement in quality. This is the law of diminishing marginal returns, and it’s a very real thing.</p>
<p>Audiophiles can spend stupid amounts of money on headphones and speakers. (To me, the “stupid” threshold is over $400; it may be way higher or  way lower to you.) Some headphones cost well over a thousand dollars. Still other models, designed, I think, for for people with more money than sense, retail for three thousand dollars or more. Some speakers cost tens of thousands of dollars. In addition, some people spend hundreds or thousands on receivers, amps, DACs, and whatever other signal processing they want to use to drive their headphones or speakers. The audiophile hobby can get extremely expensive, if you have the money and are never satisfied with what you have. It doesn’t have to be, though.</p>
<p>In my opinion, you have to stop spending money on audio equipment at some point. If you are never satisfied with what you have, the problem may be something other than not having spent enough to buy decent hardware. You can still be an audiophile without buying new equipment all the time or going broke (or merely being ripped off) on over-expensive gear. It’s about the love of the game—the love of music and the gear it plays on—not the love of spending or the fear of missing out on an even better thing.</p>

		<a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2018/04/27/swiftodo-development-notes.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-04-27 22:00:00 -0500">Apr 27, 2018</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Weekly updates to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SwiftoDo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> came to an end in early April, but work on SwiftoDo has continued apace.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I am working on an update, version 2.12.0, that includes a couple minor, but long-requested features: (1) a setting to preserve priority on completed tasks and (2) a default priority setting for new tasks. Implementing these features required lots of behind-the-scenes effort. Consequently, neither could be completed in less than a week.</p>
<p>I am currently working on improving the Dropbox code that (1) checks whether SwiftoDo is authorized to access Dropbox, and (2) reports this to the user in a clear and actionable way. This is necessary because Dropbox can de-authorize SwiftoDo for various reasons, including when I upgrade the Dropbox library I am using, which is exactly what the version I am working on does. When this happens, SwiftoDo will alert the user after an upload or a download fails. Based on user reports, however, this notification doesn’t always happen, which can lead to data loss if the user does not realize you are working offline.</p>
<p>Once I finish my work on the Dropbox-related code, I can release this version.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After I complete version 2.12.0, I plan to focus my efforts on implementing iOS 11 Files integration. Everything else, other than fixing critical bugs, will be put on hold.</p>
<p>The basic mechanics of Files integration are not hard, but they are not really meant for a to-do app—especially one that manages two files. I am unsure if it would require uses to re-open their todo.txt and archive files periodically, after the app is killed, or every time you wish to archive, which may be annoying to users. I am not yet sure how it will affect archiving, manual sync mode, and whether offline access would be possible.</p>
<p>In a best-case scenario, Files integration will eventually allow me to get rid of the Dropbox-related code within SwiftoDo, and rely on Apple’s and Dropbox’s native integration.</p>
<p>In a worst-case scenario, I won’t be able to get Files integration working without giving up too many features or conveniences of the current app.</p>
<p>So, after version 2.12.0 is released, you may not hear from me for some time about development, but I will be hard at work nonetheless.</p>

			 <p>It seems to me that massive outbreaks of food borne illness are becoming more and more common. That <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-outbreak-worsens-98-people-now-sick-n869681">our current, worsening outbreak</a> is the <em>second</em> E. Coli outbreak tied to my favorite type of lettuce in the past six months or so, and it is so virulent, is making me feel worried about our food system, and pessimistic about my country’s will to improve it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An outbreak of E. coli food poisoning linked to romaine lettuce has widened and has now made at least 98 people sick, federal health officials said Friday.</p>
<p>More than half have had to be hospitalized because the strain of E. coli causing this outbreak is an especially nasty one, the officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said.</p>
<p>People in 22 states have reported E. coli infections linked to the outbreak, the CDC and FDA said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m no expert in this, but I feel like we have several problems in our food system that have, in the past few decades, started to compound in dangerous ways that we should have seen coming. Some of these problems include overcrowding of animals, overuse of antibiotics in livestock, and over-concentration in production and processing. When bad hygiene infects food, it’s worse now than it used to be. The bacteria are more resistant to antibiotics, and the food, and food borne illness, is distributed all across the country.</p>
<p>Another annoyance to me, as a someone who has eaten some raw eggs (usually in cookie dough or homemade eggnog) and rare meat over the years, is that I have <em>never</em> gotten a food borne illness from those activities. I have, however, gotten terribly ill several times from eating restaurant salads, probably due to unwashed hands or vegetables. There are menu warnings about undercooked meat in every restaurant I go to, but none about the danger of eating unwashed vegetables.</p>
<p>I am impatiently awaiting the day I can eat Caesar salads again.</p>

			 <p>I recently finished reading Steen Johnson’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/books/review/how-we-got-to-now-by-steven-johnson.html">How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World</a>. It was a breezy and pleasurable read, full of interesting information. Johnson’s writing is clear, concise, and engaging throughout.</p>
<p>As a huge nerd who spent a lot of time in childhood perusing a science and technology encyclopedia, and a lot of time in my teens watching tech-related documentaries on Discovery and TLC (before those networks drifted to reality TV), I already knew a lot of the material. Still, it’s a wonderful read to anyone who loves the “history of ideas course” way of looking at disparate, seemingly unrelated things in everyday life, and drawing a through line that connects them all. Plus I learned new phrases that describe these unintended and intended technological and cultural developments—“hummingbird effects” and “the adjacent possible”—that I particularly like.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I picked up <a href="https://1blocker.com/">1Blocker X</a> based on <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/1blocker-x-for-ios-review/">this review from John Voorhies on MacStores</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first thing you will notice when you set up 1Blocker X on an iOS device is its 7 toggles in Safari’s Content Blocker section of the Settings app. It’s a bit of a head-scratcher at first until you realize that this is what allows 1Blocker X to expand beyond the confines of its predecessor.</p>
<p>You see, iOS limits the number of blocking rules that can be implemented by an app to 50,000. That’s a lot of rules, but sadly not enough given the amount of junk on the Internet these days. As a result, it’s a limit that 1Blocker began to run into not long after it launched in 2015.</p>
<p>Finding a way around that hard limit required a rewrite of 1Blocker from the ground up. The result is 1Blocker X, an app with around three times as many blocking rules, room to grow, and enhanced flexibility for applying those rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I really needed to replace the content blocker I had been using, but it hadn&rsquo;t been updated in a really long time, so I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s blocking rules are up-to-date.</p>
<p>Much of the work these things do is invisilble. It&rsquo;s easy to see if ads are blocked, of course, but not so with trackers and malware, which I care more about. At home I <em>also</em> block ads at the DNS level using <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a>, running on an old Raspberry Pi. I heartily recommend setting up a Pi-hole (it&rsquo;s easy; there are tutorials to follow). I miss having it when I&rsquo;m out of the house, which is why a content blocker is helpful, too.</p>
<p>So far, 1Blocker X has been working just fine. I&rsquo;ve noticed no decrease in speed from Safari, despite the crazy amount of blocking rules I have enabled.</p>

I&rsquo;m a comic book fan, though, and &ldquo;Justice League” felt like the sort of story i&rsquo;ve seen many times before, but, of course, filmed in live action with tons of special effects. I thought that the film <em>did</em> have problems, but it was obviously made for comic book fans—who have read and seen the save-the-world story many times before, and want to see an even bigger version of it—and it succeeded more than all the negative reviews suggested. Yes, I could quibble about a dozen things, and I think the movie would have been even better with just Wonder Woman, Batman, and Superman in it, but I enjoyed it quite a bit, and hope they make a sequel in a couple years.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’m an audiophile now<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. What does that even mean? Am I just an overexcited consumer with enough disposable income to blow a lot of money on headphones? Hopefully there is more to it than that.</p>
<p>A lot of people, when talking about speakers or headphones, preface their comments with “I’m not an audiophile, but…” They do so out of humility, to admit their own limitations of hearing, and their own lack of experience discerning good sounding speakers from mediocre ones. What it is really about, however, is saying that you are not a snob. I used to do that, too. But I’ve given myself leeway to put myself in the audiophile camp, despite my lack of ear training and my lack of sophisticated acoustical measuring equipment. I want to take the term “audiophile” back from the snobs.</p>
<p>I call myself an audiophile now because I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->love<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sound. I love sound so much that I listen to music hours and hours each day. I love sound so much that I will listen to types of music I didn’t like before—EDM, hip-hop, country, standards, soundtracks—just because they <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sound<!-- raw HTML omitted --> good. I love sound so much I will spend large—but not obscene or unlimited—amounts of money on decent equipment.</p>
<p>My love of sound itself is a relatively new development. While I have loved music as long as I can remember, what  drove that love was always the melody, the song structure, the lyrics, and the performance—all the normal things people enjoy about music. The production, on the other hand, was not important to me. In fact, over-produced recordings turned me off, because studio slickness betrayed, in my opinion, the authenticity of the music.</p>
<p>Now, I think differently. I admire the craft of studio engineers in a way I never appreciate before. Some recordings just <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sound<!-- raw HTML omitted --> great, and that is part of the pleasure of listening to them. Similarly, some singers have have beautiful voices, and it doesn’t matter if they are singing the same old songs (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->ahem<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, standards): the sound of their voices brings life to the music and helps make it worthwhile to listen to.</p>
<p>To me, being an audiophile is about appreciating the  distinction between the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sound<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->music<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and deriving pleasure from it, far more than it is about spending vast amounts of money on expensive equipment, or believing the hokum perpetrated by high-end audio equipment manufacturers and sellers.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Today I released the ninth update to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SwiftoDo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in about ten weeks. What is driving all these small (but good!) releases? Two main things:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>SwiftoDo is a good app, but it is by no means perfect. There are a lot of things that can be improved. My development task list for the app is a mile long. For a long time, the most important items on that list were also the most difficult for me to implement. To be honest, some of those “most important” improvements <!-- raw HTML omitted -->feel like<!-- raw HTML omitted --> they are beyond my current capabilities as a developer—but that doesn’t mean that I can’t make improvements somewhere. The app can still get better.</p>
<p>Sometimes, small things can make the app a lot better. Based on many emails with customers, I have learned that, a lot of times, a simple-to-implement feature, rather than a broad reimagining of a portion of the app, will make a big difference to their enjoyment of the app and the productivity they gain from it. That’s why I have been working on “small” features, such as the full file editor, that merely build on what was already there, but end up making the app more powerful and flexible for users. That is also my rationale behind improving application performance, which has become a much higher priority for me this year. Better performance benefits <!-- raw HTML omitted -->everybody<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I also decided to release features and fixes regularly and frequently. Every week I ask myself, “How can you make the app better for your customers?” And, on another day each week, I ask myself, “Is my latest commit better than what my customers have?” Once I’m sure the new version is better than the last version, I release it.</p>
<p>I figure that adding small features and fixing small bugs eventually accumulates, and my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->good<!-- raw HTML omitted --> app can eventually become a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->great<!-- raw HTML omitted --> app.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’m working on SwiftoDo because it the app is useful to me and because it is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fun<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Coding is fun for me, but certainly not every minute of it. Sometimes I have to fight with UIKit’s quirks or work around its bugs, which can take hours of frustrating work. Sometimes I fail to get a feature working without introducing a crash or breaking something else in the app. Sometimes things just don’t work, and it’s really hard to figure out why. Sometimes I’m stuck, and that’s no fun.</p>
<p>I have decided not to remain stuck for more than a day or two anymore. If something isn’t working, I table the work and move onto smaller, solvable problems for a while. This philosophy has led me to work on features that seem simple, useful, and fun to code, but maybe not as important as the larger, more difficult things that have been blocking my progress. That explains why I’ve been pushing forward on improvements to the task text editor, for example, rather than adding new data providers. As a side benefit, working on those smaller things sometimes clears a way, either in the codebase or in my mind, to tackle those larger, more important items.</p>
<p>So, what’s fun? Racking up win after win, week after week, by pushing a better version of my app out to my users. And knowing, every day, that no matter what is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the app yet, what <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the app keeps getting better.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>SwiftoDo’s version number, currently at 2.9.2, is heading into the weird-looking, double-digit-minor-version-number terrority. The next version I release will be 2.10.0.</p>
<p>As Apple suggests, I’m using a 3-number <!-- raw HTML omitted -->semantic version numbering<!-- raw HTML omitted --> system, with my own rules for what increments each component. Architectural changes to the app (such as a total rewrite) will bump the first number. Adding new user facing features will bump the second number. Fixing bugs or enhancing existing features, in minor ways, will bump the third number.</p>
<p>Because I am releasing so often now, and batching fewer new user-facing features together, the minor version number has been increasing rapidly. No one should care what the version number is, as long as it goes up. I don’t really care if it is, eventually, version 2.50.0. I does look a little funny to me, though.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have not been releasing updates to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SwiftoDo Desktop<!-- raw HTML omitted --> recently. The main reason for that is that SwiftoDo Desktop is, basically, feature complete. Unfortunately, because it is coded in Objective C and relies on cell-based table views (mainly for the inline editing to work), it sits at a technological dead end. A total rewrite is in order.</p>
<p>I have prepared for this scenario. My todo.txt-related code is in a framework that can be ported over to the Mac easily. In fact, I have started and stopped a total rewrite of the Mac version a couple times now, but have never gotten that far into it. The things holding me back are:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In June, Apple <!-- raw HTML omitted -->may<!-- raw HTML omitted --> announce <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a new framework<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that would allow me to port my iOS code to the Mac much more easily. If that happens, my ability to provide an updated Mac version would be greatly improved.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m listening tonight to a &ldquo;hi-res&rdquo; 24-bit, 96kHz lossless version of &ldquo;August and Everything After” through my good headphones, DAC, and amp tonight. I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->love<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this album. It helps that I was 15 when it came out, of course. But still, I think it is an emotionally rich artistic achievement. It surprised me when such an earnest, heartfelt record became wildly popular; only in the 1990s would that happen, I guess.</p>
<p>I compared this hi-res version, track by track, with two other versions I have on hand:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The main improvement the hi-res version brings over the CD-quality rip, to my ears, is a lower noise floor. Otherwise, it sounds the same as the CD version. You gain about 1-2% in fidelity at the price of lot of extra bits on the hard drive, and, perhaps, more dollars out of your wallet. This is true even though the 24-bit version was mastered to be a little quieter than the original CD and iTunes versions. You have to turn it up a notch to match the others' volume. Even with more amplification, the hi-res version&rsquo;s noise floor is incredibly low, and everything sounds fantastic.</p>
<p>Overall, I would prefer to listen to all my music in lossless quality, in as high fidelity as possible. It can sound better than lossy rips, and, even if I can’t hear the difference on a particular track, why not listen to the best version available? That said, I subscribe to Apple Music, which serves AAC files, rather than Tidal, which has a lossless streaming plan, primarily for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->convenience<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Fortunately, for me, Apple’s 256kbps AAC files are completely adequate substitutes for lossless rips. I do think, though, that if Apple offered a lossless plan at a slight up-charge, I would subscribe to it.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have realized recently that I have slowly but surely slipped from the category of “normal person” to the category of “audiophile”. I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->never<!-- raw HTML omitted --> would call myself an audiophile before, so this is somewhat shocking to me.</p>
<p>I always thought that audiophiles were people who threw away thousands of dollars, unnecessarily, on audio equipment&ndash;speakers, headphones, DACs, and so on—to “hear” “something” that I could never, ever hear myself, and was probably not even there. After realizing that I spent, probably, $1,000 or more on audio equipment last year, I think I need to brand myself with the “audiophile” label. I am listening to lots of music and enjoying it immensely, but there is something clearly wrong with me. (Just kidding—I think.)</p>
<p>A princely four-figure sum over the course of 2017 netted me some great equipment:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Even with all that great stuff at my listening desk, I am <!-- raw HTML omitted -->still<!-- raw HTML omitted --> dying to buy a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HomePod<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->or two, even<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), <!-- raw HTML omitted -->open-back headphones from HifiMan<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->B&amp;O Play headphones<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of some kind (did they just discontinue all their wired models?), and maybe a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HifiBerry<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or a piece of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Schiit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to turn one of my old Raspberry Pis back into an AirPlay receiver.</p>
<p>I have no idea why this is. All I know is that the good audio equipment I have now has made all the other speakers in the house sound like garbage to me. In a way, I am <!-- raw HTML omitted -->glad<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I don’t have the money right now to buy any of this stuff. I certainly don’t need any of it, and it won’t make my life any better.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>How did I slip from being a normal music listener to an audiophile or audiophile wannabe? I have a very good excuse—or, more likely, a series of somewhat poor excuses that snowballed into $1,000+ of spending on audio equipment in one year:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I thought it would be fun to write about all my gear from one the years, from the first crappy boombox to the amazing headphones and DAV/amp combo I am rocking these days. This is the first post in that series.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jean McDonald<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Community Manager of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Micro.blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, posted an essay today entitled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Diversity and Inclusion at Micro.blog: Where We Are, Where We Want to Go<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have been thinking about diversity on the platform since I started using it, the day it opened to the public in December 2017. Jean&rsquo;s essay inspired me to publish some of my thoughts.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Micro.blog service has not been a publicly available for long. At this point, it is understandable that the first wave of users would be primarily composed of fans of its founder, Manton Reece. Manton is an iOS and macOS developer who blogs and podcasts about his development work and the indie web. If you have come across his work online, you are probably very much like him: an iOS or macOS developer, or at least a passionate user; a tech podcast listener; or a passionate blogger or IndieWeb aficionado. This core group is, for reasons related to historical and cultural biases, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a particularly diverse one.</p>
<p>This core group describes <!-- raw HTML omitted -->me<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and certainly does not describe <!-- raw HTML omitted -->everyone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on Micro.blog, but it does describe a lot of the users I found on the service&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Discover<!-- raw HTML omitted --> page. Manton and Jean have expressed, from the very beginning, an earnest desire to create a safe community of independent micro blogs—&ldquo;safe&rdquo; from the abuse that silences disempowered people, women, and minorities on dominant social media platforms. They, along with the users of the platform, have openly discussed how to increase diversity, and the challenges inherent in doing so. I have learned a lot from reading these blog posts and discussions. Like them, I wish for Micro.blog to attract and retain a more diverse user base. The question we all face now is: how?</p>
<p>Here are a few ideas.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jean McDonald<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This should be one of the public-facing mantras that applies to the entire project, much like &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be evil&rdquo; was to Google for many years. Jean&rsquo;s quote should be atop the &ldquo;Community Guidelines&rdquo; page, and a link to that page should be near the top of the &ldquo;help.micro.blog&rdquo; page.</p>
<p>I think Micro.blog should put a lot more focus on the community guidelines and whatever technology or processes are used to enforce them. It&rsquo;s a key feature of the platform. People behaving <!-- raw HTML omitted -->well<!-- raw HTML omitted --> together is the core of the product for me, and a key differentiator between it and Twitter.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What is Micro.blog, anyway? To <!-- raw HTML omitted -->IndieWeb<!-- raw HTML omitted --> people, it&rsquo;s kind of obvious. To everybody else, maybe not.</p>
<p>If asked, today, to sell it to someone, I might say: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the good parts of Twitter, with none of the bad parts.&rdquo; I might explain that microblogging is simply sharing something about yourself in public, and that Micro.blog is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->safe<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->respectful<!-- raw HTML omitted --> place to do so, because it has protections against abuse, and strict community guidelines. If they are unsure why they should share thing in public, I would explain that it is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->empowering<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to do so. It is putting your best foot forward online.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Having a simple, concise marketing message is essential, but that message needs to be spread somehow. One of the best ways to market these days is on podcasts.</p>
<p>Manton has a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->microcast<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which have brought a lot of people to Micro.blog thus far. I think podcasts are a great opportunity to promote the open, inclusive, but safe nature of Micro.blog. While podcast audiences may, as a whole, skew white, male, and wealthy, there <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tons of podcasts out there that are hosted by, feature as panelists, and cater to women and minorities. I&rsquo;m sure that Manton is adjacent enough to other tech podcasters to get some guest spots on tech podcasts that feature or cater to these groups.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Micro.blog users are all, at this point, early adopters, and most of us are especially committed to the platform and want it to succeed. Ask us to publicize the service. Give us some ideas how to do that effectively, and in ways that will increase diversity. Provide incentives for us to sign up new people, such as additional badges (which are free to provide) or free months of Micro.blog hosting (which of course incurs a cost). I&rsquo;m sure something will come of it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My list of suggestions is by no means exhaustive, and Manton and Jean are likely in a better position than I am to understand what they need to do, and what they can do. I do want to express that diversity is important for all of us, even white, male, Americans such as myself. If all people are treated with dignity and are allowed to participate in something (work, society, etc.), outcomes will be better, and life will be richer, for all of us. I have seen that firsthand at a small scale, and wish to see it at a much larger scale. Micro.blog is a good place to start.</p>

			 <p>Replacing &ldquo;Keyboard-&rdquo; with the keyboard emoji (⌨️) solves a minor problem I have in the Drafts 5 beta: You can&rsquo;t sort or hide action groups, and the keyboard-related groups, while useful, are not ones I open from the action groups menu. The ⌨️ emoji sorts them below normal letters.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->SwiftoDo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a passion project for me. I love working on it, but, due to work and family obligations, I have very little time to do so. Consequently, I am <!-- raw HTML omitted -->way<!-- raw HTML omitted --> behind schedule in adopting features introduced in iOS 11. I also learned, the hard way, that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lots<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of minor UI-related bugs popped up when I changed the app’s target iOS framework from 9.0 to 11.0. I have been slowly discovering and cleaning up those bugs, and adding minor features here and there, for the past two and a half months.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have decided to release working code as soon as possible, rather than trying to batch features and bug fixes into larger releases. Therefore, I have been issuing new releases about once per week, the past few weeks. I will not be keeping up that release cadence, but I do want to reflect to my customers that the app is actively developed. More importantly, I want bugs to be fixed for all my users. I would much rather have a rock-solid, very simple app than an unstable one with lots of bells and whistles.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That said, I do want to keep adding bells and whistles. I am working on adding drag-and-drop support at this point, and plan to look into adding clickable URLs and Siri support. I have a long list of other ideas and concepts drafted, too.</p>
<p>I would like to add additional data providers, other than Dropbox, but I have little exposure to coding networking code, and the third party libraries I’ve looked at look like more trouble than they are worth. For some perspective, Dropbox’s SwiftyDropbox library, which powers file sync now, is a great library, but is also the source of most of the mysterious crashes on startup that a small number of people have reported. What is frustrating to me, as a developer, is that I can’t really fix those crashes, because I don’t fully understand what causes them, and the code is in a library. I don’t want to open my app up to more instability just to add a data provider. Also, I have been loath to support iOS 11’s Files app integration, up to this point, because I don’t see how the todo.txt “Archive” function, which moves completed tasks to another file, would be able to work with it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have way more ideas for features and improvements than time to complete them. My focus in the near term will be on stability and satisfying user requests that seem like they would be useful for a majority of my users. Hopefully that is good enough for now. It’s amazing how much work my simple, text-based task list app has been!</p>

<p>At my local grocery store, eye round roasts are relatively cheap and plentiful in the cold weather months. They are all cut to just over 2 lbs, as well, so this recipe works pretty well for me. If your roast is larger, set the oven&rsquo;s &ldquo;on&rdquo; time to 5 minutes per pound.</p>
<p>The exact measurements of the spice rub are not important, but it should consist of mostly salt. It is important to heavily salt the roast and to let it sit at room temperature for at least an hour prior to putting it in the oven. If the roast is too cold, it will not cook through properly.</p>
<p>I have found that these roasts leave enough fat in the pan to allow me to make a pan gravy with just a bit of flour (about 1 tbsp) and 1 cup of liquid (often just beef broth). (It there isn’t enough fat left over to make a roux, add butter to the flour.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Dry off roast with paper towels.</p>
<p>Create a spice rub by mixing the kosher salt, black pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. Coat the roast on all sides with the spice rub. (You will likely not use all the spice rub.) Let it sit at room temperature for 1 hour.</p>
<p>Set an oven rack to the middle or upper middle position. Heat the oven to 500º F.</p>
<p>Coat the roast with a thin layer of olive oil and place it on a pan. A 12-inch cast iron or stainless steel skillet works fine. A rack is optional.</p>
<p>Put the pan in the oven and roast it for 10 minutes, or about 5 minutes per pound. Then, shut off the oven, and do not open it for 2 hours.</p>
<p>After 2 hours, the internal temperature of the roast should be about 145° F. Set the roast aside and, optionally, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->make a pan sauce from the drippings<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

<p>This is a hearty, pasta-free soup, fit for a winter meal. Lots of vegetables, sausage (either chicken or pork sausage can be used), and cooking liquid from cannellini beans (canned or homemade) lead to a chunky, filling soup with a rich mouth feel.</p>
<p>Developing a fond while cooking the sausage will add an important foundation to the soup&rsquo;s flavor. Deglazing this fond early, before cooking the vegetables in the same pot, will prevent it from burning.</p>
<p>Ideally, the vegetables should be soft but not browned; if they are not softening sufficiently during the sauté, simmer them longer in the broth, rather than extending the sauté.</p>
<p>You can substitute your preferred herbs for the Italian seasoning that I use. If using fresh herbs, add them at the very end, or just before serving.</p>
<p>If you wish to add pasta, ditalini works well. Cook the pasta separately, and add it just before serving, to avoid the pasta absorbing too much of the broth during cooking or storage.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In a large pot or Dutch oven, brown the sausage in 1 tbsp of olive oil for 4 minutes per side over medium heat. This will likely not cook it through, which is fine; it will cook through later in the soup. Remove the sausage and set it aside.</p>
<p>Deglaze the pot with 1/2 cup water or chicken broth. Retain this liquid in a cup or bowl; it will be added back to the soup later. If the retained liquid contains any solids, strain it to remove them.</p>
<p>Once the par-cooked sausage is cool enough, cut it into coins and set it aside, to be added back to the pot later.</p>
<p>Dry out the pot and add 1 tbsp olive oil. Sauté the onion, carrots, and celery over medium heat until they are soft but not browned, about 10 minutes. If the vegetables are not completely soft after the sauté, that is OK; they can be softened after the liquid is added. Add the escarole and Italian seasoning and stir everything to combine.</p>
<p>Add the chicken broth, and add back the retained liquid from deglazing. Raise the temperature to high until the broth starts to boil; then lower the temperature to medium or medium low, to maintain a low simmer. Simmer until the vegetables are soft, which can take 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Add the cannellini beans, including their cooking liquid, and the sausage. (These ingredients are added later to avoid overcooking them, which would lead to split beans and tough sausage.) Continue to simmer until the sausage is cooked through, which will take only a few minutes.</p>
<p>Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste. If, at this point, the soup tastes dull, add some fresh squeezed lemon juice, little by little, until the broth tastes as bright as you want it to.</p>
<p>Serve topped with finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</p>

I&rsquo;m glad the author addressed the isolation of all the main characters in real life, at least a little. It could have had more depth in that area, but that might have diminished its charm.</p>

			 <p>I am still using the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Plaintext Productivity<!-- raw HTML omitted --> system that I wrote about in 2013. It is a productivity system, based primarily on plaintext files, for Microsoft Windows users. Since I published a few people have asked me to write an update to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Plaintext Productivity<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The fact is, the system has held up so well for me that I really don’t have any updates to report.</p>
<p>One reason my system remains pretty much the same as it was in 2013 is that the operating system it is based on, <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Windows<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, despite some cosmetic changes, remains pretty much the same as it was in 2013. Sure, it got a better UI when Windows 10 supplanted Windows 7 and 8, but Windows still <!-- raw HTML omitted -->works<!-- raw HTML omitted --> just as well and just as poorly. Another pillar of the system, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sublime Text<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, also had a design change recently, to display more crisply on high-DPI screens, but it, too, works pretty much the same as it did in 2013.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Because I was stuck on Windows, an operating system I did not particular like, I had to make do with built-in functionality, portable apps that I could sneak onto my system, and a universal file format: plaintext. Even this was challenging. Windows, for all it’s ubiquity, has a dearth of good <!-- raw HTML omitted -->third party<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (non-Microsoft) software for it. There is a lot of crapware in the Windows Store, several world class apps from Adobe that everyone knows about, and not that much in between. Macintosh, iOS, and to a far lesser extent, Android, have attracted the attention on small, boutique publishers and indie developers who have contributed great plaintext-based apps. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Like me<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Best of all, in my opinion, are its numerous, well-defined keyboard shortcuts for shifting lines around, selecting words, selecting whole lines, deleting whole lines, and so on. Its support for multiple text selection and multiple cursors makes certain quick edits, like making a bunch of lines a bullet list in Markdown, a snap; it’s actually kind of mind blowing when you get used to it. Lastly, I=its find and replace functionality is incredibly powerful as well, considering it supports regular expressions.</p>
<p>I have found no compelling reason to switch it out for a newer, shiner app—which is the whole point of having a simple productivity system in the first place.</p>
<p>I should say, though, that I do use Editorial or Ulysses on my iPad as a sidekick text editor quite frequently. I started to do so for a non-software related reason: my work machine’s mechanical keyboard is so loud that it bothers people on conference calls, while my iPad’s keyboard—the Apple Magic Keyboard—is so quiet that my phone does not pick it up. Those iOS apps are fantastic, but they are not vital to my Plaintext Productivity system.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Todo.txt<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the best system for me because my work, and my GTD-inspired way of looking at my work, tends to present itself as a large number of tasks that get picked up, dropped, and re-prioritized frequently. I have started to dabble with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TaskPaper<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for some of my planning needs, either in my daily work journaling, or when I have a self-directed project to plan, such as drafting a proposal or creating a software-based audit tool. TaskPaper is interesting, but I do too much sorting and filtering of tasks throughout the day for it to supplant todo.txt as my main task list system.</p>
<p>I don’t keep track of every task in my life in todo.txt, however. I prefer to keep my personal tasks separate from my work ones, mainly because I find having them commingled with work tasks distracts me from my work. Therefore, I keep my personal tasks in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reminders<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which has had solid Siri support and cross-Apple-device syncing since 2011, and has only gotten better since then. I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have<!-- raw HTML omitted --> changed a lot about how I managed non-work tasks since 2013, but those fall outside my Plaintext Productivity system.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you are interested in streamlining your Windows workflows, and discovering a productivity system that really lasts, I encourage you to check out my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Plaintext Productivity<!-- raw HTML omitted --> guide.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t measure anything.

			 <p>One thing to do when you’re supposed to be writing is to fuss about your writing environment.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Choosing the perfect writing font is a classic way to procrastinate—but it is not a waste of time. Fonts are important. A good font is not only highly legible, it also conveys a subliminal emotional effect on the reader. Naturally, it follows that it will also have similar effects on the writer. A good font will make you feel better while you are writing—maybe because you can read it more easily, or because you find elements of it, its curves or serifs, aesthetically pleasing. Whatever the reason, picking a font that is pleasing can have a profound effect on your writing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For me, as a writer and programmer who began typing text on a computer in the 1980s, I gravitate toward <!-- raw HTML omitted -->monospaced fonts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Every character in a monospaced font has the same width. This is useful in programming or for data files, because, in those uses, you often want to align columns of text. It is not useful at all in typesetting books, of course; text laid out in monospace fonts looks primitive and wide-open. Primitive and wide-open, however, are perfect attributes for text that I am writing, breaking apart, moving around, and recombining. Writing in monospaced fonts is, on a subconscious level, freeing. It helps me feel like nothing in my text is set in stone.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Whether the font is monospaced or proportional is only part of what is important. Other things matter, too: the shapes of the characters; whether they have serifs or not; whether some look identical to others (l vs. 1, or O vs. 0, for example); and so on.</p>
<p>Beyond that, some fonts <!-- raw HTML omitted -->render<!-- raw HTML omitted --> better on screen than others. For example, Verdana and Georgia were commissioned by Microsoft specifically to be look good, clear, and legible <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on screens<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, rather than on paper. This was revolutionary at the time, as was their free-to-use licensing. Consequently, these two fonts were adopted almost everywhere on the web for a while. Georgia is still one of the eight font options in Apple’s iBooks ebook reader.</p>
<p>Your particular display and operating system have a lot to do with what font looks good. In general, displays are much higher resolution and much higher quality now than when Verdana and Consolas were invented. As you might expect, this means that all all scalable fonts look better on modern, high-resolution displays. Still, some fonts will look much sharper than others on some displays. For example, on my Dell 27” 4K display for my work machine, a Windows 10 laptop, Consolas looks the best for the terminal and any coding I am doing, and Sax Mono looks better for writing actual documents. These fonts don’t offer similar advantages to me on my Mac or on iOS, however. They look fine, but they really pop for me on my work machine.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are tons of monospaced fonts available. Here are a handful that I have used over the years, with the platform I used them on in parentheses. I recommend trying them in your text editor, especially the newer ones listed at the bottom.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>These are listed in the order in which I have adopted them. I tend to use only a few at a time, depending on which one looks best on my hardware and software at the moment. Below, I highlight two of my favorite, very much related, fonts for writing these days: Plex and iA Writer Duospace.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>IBM released <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Plex<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an open source font that will be used in all of IBM’s published materials going forward, in late 2017. It isn’t the only open source font that’s free for anyone to download and use, but it is a really good one. Plex Mono, its monospaced variant, looks fantastic on my iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Its edges are crisp, and the stroke has a consistent width; it looks like the lines fit just right in the pixel grid that makes up the screen.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The iOS development company iA took IBM’s Plex Mono and tweaked it a little bit to make it even better, in their opinion, for writing. They kept the font monospaced <!-- raw HTML omitted -->except for M’s and W’s<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It’s a pretty simple change, but a lot of thought went into it. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iA Writer’s article about this process<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is absolutely fascinating—I highly recommend reading the whole thing.</p>
<p>The resultant font, iA Writer Duospace, looks great on my MacBook Pro. I prefer Plex Mono on my iPad and iPhone, though. There is something about the wider W and M that looks different in the two platforms. It could just be that my iOS screens are a lot smaller, and width is at a greater premium. It could also just be that I prefer my letters to line up vertically, especially when my text is constrained to a narrow column.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For now, I am very happy writing in Plex and iA Writer Duo on my Apple devices. I still happily use SaxMono and Consolas on the PC for writing notes and coding, though Plex Mono is starting to creep into use for my todo.txt file and in other places. Every year or two I look for something better, but I probably won’t change from these four main fonts until I get new hardware, which could change how everything is rendered, but that is probably a long way off.</p>

			 <p>I started this blog in the summer, and since then I have published 30 posts, including this one. As far as output goes, I have met my goal, and I am happy with that.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the spirit of publishing year-end best-of lists, here are my top five most popular posts from 2017:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>These posts reflect some of my main interests: productivity software and systems, and Apple hardware. I have also written a little bit about Android, the Essential Phone, and  parts of the free and open web that interest me.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One thing that I have learned this year, from writing regularly again, is how much work it can be to complete a blog post. I have a half-dozen incomplete blog post drafts in my Ulysses library at any given moment. Shaping them into something worth reading is a lot of work—work that I don’t often complete as quickly as I would like. Even a simple 500-word post has to be written and re-written three or four times before I think it is worth publishing.</p>
<p>The writing process is valuable to me, though. Writing is a lot different than analyzing data (my day job) or writing code (my nighttime hobby). Writing, re-writing, and revising help me <!-- raw HTML omitted -->think<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and help me <!-- raw HTML omitted -->focus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in ways that my more mathematically-focused activities do not. Plus, it feels good to communicate to the world, and to own all the content I produce and publish it on my own platform, under my own name.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I plan to blog regularly in 2018, both on this site and on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mjdescy.micro.blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I have even set up regularly scheduled reminders (Apple Reminders, naturally) to help keep me on track. Thanks for reading.</p>

			 <p>I wonder how many people still have to use VBA for Excel and Access automation at work, like I do. Googling for Office VBA how-tos feels like jumping in a time machine and going back 10 or 20 years. It is disappointing that Microsoft never added C#/.NET support to Office, but it is understandable.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/12/05/drafts-for-ios.html">Drafts for iOS</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Drafts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a tinkerer’s DIY dream of a text editor. It nails the basics, and allows you to customize its editor and its tag and folder system to fit your specific needs—it just takes a little time (and, maybe, some JavaScript skills, for some things) to do so.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Drafts, by Agile Tortoise, isn’t exactly an unknown app. On the contrary, it is one of the crown jewels of the iOS platform. It is one of the few apps with an in-app purchase tip jar that I actually threw money in—a few times, actually. Drafts makes my life simpler, in little ways, every day. Like one of my other favorite writing apps, Ulysses, it is a pleasure to use.</p>
<p>Drafts is primarily meant for quick text entry, and then pushing that text to another app for processing or storage. For example, I type most calendar entries and Google searches in Drafts (which is in my home screen toolbar) and, in two taps, open them for processing in Fantastical or Safari (which are not in my toolbar). Drafts 4, which has been out quite a while now, expands on that basic idea, and delivers a very useful utility and a top-notch text editor.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Drafts is already well known for its automation capabilities. It is great for drafting a tweet and posting it to Twitter (either natively or via another app), or for writing out a calendar entry and pushing it to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fantastical<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Calendars 5<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for parsing. What it is not well known for—but should be—is that it is the most customizable text editor on iOS. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Editorial<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has long held that crown, thanks to its its support of snippets and extensibility with Python scripts. Drafts, however, outdoes Editorial when it comes to customizing the editor itself, which has a profound effect on  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->writing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> experience.</p>
<p>In Drafts, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->actions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> can change the text your are writing, send some or all of it to another app, turn on/off night mode within the app, and so on. You can download actions from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the developer’s extensive library<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, of, if you are a bit of a programmer, you can them yourself in JavaScript, from within the app. You can assign these actions to the main menu, which is accessible from the top-right icon, or from a swipe to the left. That’s the basic stuff. You can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->also<!-- raw HTML omitted --> assign these actions to a custom toolbar that is displayed over the keyboard. Even better, for hardware keyboard users, you can assign your own hardware keyboard shortcuts to these actions, too. No other iOS app that I use does this!</p>
<p>I use Drafts on my iPad primarily for writing notes, such as when I get a phone call or am in a meeting. I use my custom toolbar buttons to input today’s date, paste text, format headings and lists in Markdown, send various lines (text selections) to my todo.txt file (via Dropbox), and so on. At the end of my writing session, I send the entire note to Dropbox for storage.</p>
<p>Notes don’t have to be exported, however. They can stay in Drafts and sync to all your other iOS devices via iCloud. You can also organize them there. There are three basic folders—Inbox, Archive, and Trash—to put notes into. You can flag notes for future retrieval, and filter them them by folder, flag status, and keywords (search terms within the note text) into custom “folders” or saved searches as well. I have not switched over to using Drafts as a full-fledged notes app (most of my drafts get automatically deleted after 30 days in the Trash folder), but I am thinking about it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Drafts 4 has been around for a while now. Drafts 5 is coming, someday, with even more features: TaskPaper editing is a feature that I am looking forward to. I expect the pricing model to change from paid upfront to a subscription; I will be happy to pay for it, as a valuable companion to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ulysses<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for writing, and a valuable sidekick to practically every other app in the iOS ecosystem.</p>

			 <p>I love Twitter. So much information and commentary is shared there, so quickly, that it is a vital source for “what is going on on the Internet today”. At the same time, I hate Twitter, for all the bad behavior performed on the platform that Twitter, the company, tolerates. I’m not alone. A lot of people I follow feel the same way. I see tweets like this almost every day:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>— Dave DeLong (@davedelong) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->November 30, 2017<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I understand Twitter’s problems as a company. It needs eyeballs on it to sell ads. Controversy on the platform, and the sheer number of active users (whether they are real people or bots), lead to greater traffic, greater revenue, and greater return on investment for their investors—at least in the short run. In the long run, however, poisonous speech on the platform poisons the platform.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Moving away from Twitter entirely, onto another, similar platform, can work for small communities who primarily wish to communicate amongst themselves. It is unlikely, however, that a critical mass of influential users—the celebrities, journalists, etc., who make the platform valuable—will move to a different platform at this point. Without those users, another platform, however superior from a technical or community management standpoint, would not have as much value.</p>
<p>As a Twitter user, you really have two choices now: live with the abusive users, and report and block them as well as you can; or, if Twitter abuse is bothering you enough (or worse, threatening to your safety), stop using Twitter entirely. That is a sad conclusion to make, but I think it is realistic. Twitter’s ad-based model, need to generate both traffic and return on investment to satisfy its shareholders are, in the short run, at odds with its stated goal to improve safety, and therefore community, on its platform.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are other ways to write content on the internet for free, such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The problem is, you may never achieve the same reach with these other platforms as you would with Twitter. That is why I am sticking with Twitter myself. From a moralistic point of view, I would love to ditch it for something else. Despite that feeling, I get enough value from Twitter to keep using it, despite the sick-to-my-stomach feeling the Twitterverse gives me some days.</p>

			 <p>I learned about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ghost<!-- raw HTML omitted --> blogging platform today. It looks awesome, especially with its simplified feature set (just what I need, nothing else), strict adherence to Markdown for writing, well-designed multi-platform front-end applications, and so on.</p>
<p>Mostly, Ghost’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->speed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> impresses me. I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> how slow WordPress (the software that powers this blog) is compared to, say, a static website or a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jeckyll<!-- raw HTML omitted --> blog. I love fast-loading websites, and went out of my way to create static sites for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1000umbrellas.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->plaintext-productivity.net<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for that very reason.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I doubt I will ever use Ghost. I am very dedicated to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ulysses<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as a writing tool, and Ulysses does not publish directly to Ghost. It publishes directly to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is the main reason why I use WordPress. (Sure, there are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->workarounds<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for publishing from Ulysses to Ghost, but nothing beats a one-step solution.) WordPress is also ubiquitous, making it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very<!-- raw HTML omitted --> cheap and easy to self-host.</p>
<p>I could pay more for faster WordPress hosting, but, considering how few readers I have, I can’t justify the additional expense. So, for the foreseeable future, I will enjoy easy publishing to WordPress via Ulysses, extremely cheap hosting expenses, and my readers will have to wait a second or two for my blog to load. I hope nobody else minds.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/11/29/back-to-rss.html">Back to RSS and the Indie Web</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/11/29/back-to-rss.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-11-29 23:00:00 -0500">Nov 29, 2017</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>At the end of last year, I quit using RSS. It was a big step for me. I had been using RSS practically since it first became available. My first <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RSS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reader was the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sage<!-- raw HTML omitted --> plugin for FireFox, which I started using in 2004. I subscribed to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slate<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LifeHacker<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a couple other professional publications, and a fairly large number of personal blogs, covering topics ranging from technology, economics, and personal finance to cooking and television shows. I was obsessive about skimming my feed many times a day, reading every headline, and often every article, of Slate and my favorite blogs.</p>
<p>I eventually dropped Sage for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Reader<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and used it, and later Feedly, as a back-end to whatever smartphone RSS reader I was using. For years I checked my feeds a dozen times a day, read a ton of articles (though not all of them, as I used to), and generally felt pretty happy with the experience.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Eventually, though, I quit using RSS—not because it was uncool, but because it was no longer making me happy. Like those writers and podcasters said, the basic need RSS fulfilled for me—keeping current, and entertained with fresh reading material—<!-- raw HTML omitted -->was<!-- raw HTML omitted --> being fulfilled by other services. Twitter did so more timely, and with more commentary from the writers. News aggregators, such as Apple News, did so with a slicker visual style. (I am emphatically <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a regular Facebook user, so I miss out on whatever is going on there.)</p>
<p>I thought these services were more hip, modern, and fun than RSS. Most importantly, I thought they were keeping me <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more current<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. After all, for a long time, my RSS reader (the wonderful <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reeder app for iOS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) fed me the same articles that I had already seen on Twitter. Worse, it fed me five or six different publications’ takes on the same subject every day, which was interesting a few days of the year (such as when reviews of new Apple devices hit the streets), but was otherwise completely redundant.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Without RSS, I missed the spirit of the independent web: all those individuals and small publications who are sharing knowledge and expressing opinions that don’t fit into 140 characters, or even 280.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Not only RSS is still there: my longstanding RSS software is still there, too. Like in 2013, I am using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reeder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on iOS as a front end, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feedly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as a back end. Reeder has been around almost as long as the App Store. It is rarely updated, but it just works. It’s simplicity, elegance, and stability make it one of the finest apps on the platform. Feedly, the back end service that actually checks my feeds, is a free service that I basically never look at. I don’t use their website. I don’t use their app. I don’t really know or care how they make money off of me. It, like Reeder, is solid, stable, and just works.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I decided to use RSS differently now. I no longer need it to drink the content firehose and keep current with the minute-by-minute news cycle; Twitter is available for that, for good or ill. Instead, RSS enables me to follow a few interesting voices on the Internet, read their actual, in-depth thoughts, and not miss anything they have to say.</p>
<p>To these ends, I no longer follow big media sites. Primarily, I follow blogs: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->real<!-- raw HTML omitted --> blogs, written by actual people, rather than published by massive organizations. I’m mostly following Apple-focused tech bloggers and Swift programmers, which reflects my favorite hobbies—but that’s just what I’m doing for now. Lastly, I’m not checking my RSS feeds a hundred times per day. I am checking only a one or two times per day, and often I don’t have any updates. Instead of adding more feeds, I just accept it now. Sometimes there’s nothing new to read, and that’s OK.</p>
<p>I’m happy with RSS again. All it took was figuring out what I really needed to get out of it, and taking control of how I used it. It’s a really great technology, no matter how passé or uncool it seems to be.</p>

			 <p>I love <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ulysses<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This post on the Ulysses blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> illustrates its value proposition. It is a minimalistic plaintext editor. It eschews common word processing features (such as rich text formatting) and some high-end “writing app” features (storyboarding, a character name generator, etc.) in favor of a stark, clean interface and generalized organizational tools (a unified library of “sheets” that can be organized in folders or with keywords).</p>
<p>In a way, its <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lack<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of features is its greatest feature. It focuses on the text, both from a writing standpoint and a publishing standpoint. That’s what writers should do—and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->want<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to do (really!). But writing is hard work. It requires incredible focus, and achieving and maintaining that focus is really hard. Just about anything is easier than writing most of the time. That’s why writers, famously, procrastinate. Sometimes, though, writers get into a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->flow state<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, just like software developers do, and any distraction will break that flow. App-induced distractions are particularly unwelcome. The worst offenders, ironically, tend to be features that promise to help make your writing process easier—especially if those features don’t exactly gel with what you are doing.</p>
<p>Ulysses gets that. Its feature set is intentionally uncomplicated and applicable to a broad base of writers. It hides some of its most powerful functionality, such as its awesome publishing features, until you actually need it. It doesn’t impose any system, workflow, or rules on you. Its simple system of sheets, folders, and keywords allows you to build your own organizational system that is specific to your projects—or, alternatively, to ignore organization until you absolutely need it. Most importantly, it puts the focus on the text, right where it needs to be.</p>

			 <p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Essential Phone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has been making some interesting moves in the market lately.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It has had a reputation amongst tech writers and podcasters as a market failure. This reputation was somewhat deserved. At launch, it had its share of problems. Its camera app was slow, unstable, and took inferior pictures. Some people (not me) experienced lag in the user interface, mostly micro-stutter while scrolling (a common Android defect). The speaker grill had a tendency to fall out. Reports circulated that only an embarrassingly low 5,000 units had been sold in the first few weeks.</p>
<p>Essential has almost completely fixed these problems. The camera app is faster and takes better photos. The user interface runs more smoothly than ever; micro-stutter is gone. I had the misfortune to have the speaker grill defect on my phone, but they RMA’d it within three days, and the new phone has a different grill design. I think the recent drop in sales price by $200, to a more reasonable $499, will probably make a huge difference in sales volume.</p>
<p>I feel heartened that they are working hard to solve their problems, and get their phone (which is pretty great) into more people’s hands. People <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are<!-- raw HTML omitted --> coming around—case in point, these articles:</p>

			 <p>I wonder this, as smartphones are maturing into what may be their final form: bezel-less slabs of glass with high-res screens, microphones, and sensors, that all look pretty much the same. The iPhone 8, for example, is the fourth generation of iPhone with the same basic form factor. A few years back, this would have been unheard of. A few years from now, though, I wouldn’t be surprised if there still is a “legacy” iPhone out there with this form factor, discounted several hundred dollars below what the iPhone X form-factor phone of the day will cost.</p>
<p>If all smartphones have the same basic shape, does it even matter which one you have? I think it does. You can still hate one phone and love another with the same case design. There are other things that matter, beyond the obvious distinction in operating system and/or Android skin. My experience with the iPhone 6S vs. the iPhone 7 is a case in point.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Last September, I traded in my one-year-old iPhone 6S Plus for an iPhone 7 Plus, though Apple’s iPhone upgrade program. I hadn’t originally intended to do this. I had always kept my phones for two full years, and I chose the iPhone upgrade plan to get a nice monthly payment that also included AppleCare+.</p>
<p>The reason why I upgraded last year is that, after a year with it, I decided that I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hated<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the iPhone 6S Plus. My 6S Plus was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fine<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and I never had any problems with the hardware or software, but I never really liked it, for several reasons. First, it was big, and I wasn’t used to big phones at that point. Second, it was ugly: the space gray aluminum finish was dull and drab. Third, it was ungainly: not only was it a large phone that strained my hand and my pockets, but its edges were smooth and slippery. Its Apple leather case was awful, too: it had mushy, hard to distinguish buttons, and its patina became slick and unpleasant after only a few months of wear. (Yes, I know the leather case is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the phone, but as it was an Apple product released alongside the phone, I think it is fair to include it in my assessment here.) The phone’s camera and software ecosystem were great, but it didn’t feel good in my hand, and that is crucial to how attached you can get to a handheld device.</p>
<p>While I grew to hate the iPhone 6S Plus, I quickly grew to love the iPhone 7 Plus. This surprised me, because the 7 Plus is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->basically the same phone<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Sure, it has several major improvements—most notably, dual rear cameras and a much faster processor. Its minor improvements, however, contribute a lot more to my love for it. First, it looks great: the black finish is gorgeous and even blends seamlessly with Apple’s black leather case. Second, it feels great: I like the feel of the back much better, and the Apple leather case that came out with it has better quality leather, and clicky buttons on the sides. Its Taptic Engine, which provides force feedback for 3D Touch, the home button, and various user interface interactions, is absolutely amazing. It makes certain interactions, like scrolling picker views, 3D touching app icons, or pressing the home button, feel like you are interacting with actual, three-dimensional objects. It doesn’t vibrate as much as tap you with a reassuring, nearly soundless thud. The force feedback feels so good that it is almost addicting. It’s the kind of thing you would never think is important before you have it, but you don’t want to live without it once you do—like having heated seats in your car, for instance, or even the Apple Watch.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have the Essential Phone, now, too, which runs Android. I love it, too, though not as much as the iPhone. Why I love it, however, is a similar story to the one above, but it takes into account other manufacturers’ phones as well.</p>
<p>The Essential is one of a new breed of “bezel-less” phones. (These phones all still have bezels or notches or cutouts somewhere.) It is a smaller phone with a larger screen, much like the iPhone X, Pixel 2 XL, and Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Its lack of bezels make it smaller, and therefore easier to hold and pocket, than my iPhone 7 Plus, and other flagship phones of yesteryear.</p>
<p>Its glass screen and ceramic back make it like an impossibly smooth and cool piece of jet black soap. Its flat sides and smooth edges make it just grippy enough to feel secure in the hand, as opposed to slippery and droppable. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Holding it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, rather than using it, is the luxurious part of the experience. It feels just fantastic in the hand.</p>
<p>It doesn’t hurt that it has snappy performance as well—but you could get that from other phones as well. In fact, I vastly prefer it to the Samsung Galaxy phones and Pixel phones (the last generation, alas) that I’ve held. While those are the top Android phones in performance, hardware design, and features, I just don’t like them. It’s hard to put my finger on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->exactly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> why, but the materials and case design do not suit my tastes at all. They feel icky to me, in a way the Essential Phone never did.</p>

<p>It isn’t 100% rational what makes a piece of technology suit you. It’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->emotional<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And sometimes the most subtle things—such as the color and feel of the materials, or the quality of the haptic feedback—can make you love a phone, or hate it.</p>
<p>Great haptic feedback is a major contributor to why the iPhone 7 Plus is my favorite phone. It feels great, and it feels <!-- raw HTML omitted -->alive<!-- raw HTML omitted --> when I touch it. I didn’t expect that feature to even matter to me, let along <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bind<!-- raw HTML omitted --> me to that particular model of phone. But it did. I don’t think most handset manufactures get that. After all, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->feeling<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is not a checklist feature.</p>
<p>I think Apple <!-- raw HTML omitted -->does<!-- raw HTML omitted --> get it, and little things like the Taptic Engine feeling so different than anything else are intentional parts of their industrial design and marketing strategies. Their industrial design and marketing teams have started (first, in my opinion, with the Apple Watch, and then with the iPhone 7), to really concentrate on what makes personal technology <!-- raw HTML omitted -->personal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->—that emotional connection you can have to your devices. And what they are doing is certainly working on me.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Essential Phone<!-- raw HTML omitted -->’s core features is that it runs stock Android, rather than a flashy but slow and heavyweight skin like Samsung’s TouchWiz. Using this phone has been my chance to reacquaint myself with Android after a six year break, which was, in many ways, more interesting to me than testing out a phone with a cutting-edge, “bezel-less” design.</p>
<p>My last Android device was a Motorola Droid, running CyanogenMod’s version of Android Froyo. By the time I was able to upgrade to an iPhone 4S, in 2011, I wanted to throw the Droid against the wall. While it had lots of cool apps and was packed with features, it was so unreliable that I could barely make calls or take pictures with it any more. The iPhone, in comparison, seemed restrained and tasteful in design, fast and efficient in processing, and 100% reliable. What it lacked in customizability, it gained in simplicity and stability.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Stock Android has changed less than I expected since my days running CyanogenMod on my Droid. When I unboxed the Essential phone, I was surprised right away that Google’s phone setup process was essentially unchanged since 2011. It worked well then, though, and it worked just as well today.</p>
<p>That same “it if ain’t broke, don’t fix it” attitude has been applied to be base Android OS features, too: the home screen, notification shade, app drawer, and so on were pretty much unchanged as well. Again, they are functional, and, unlike on iOS, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->replaceable<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by third party software; understandably, improving them must be a low priority for Google.</p>
<p>Android’s largest transformation since 2011, at least from a user’s perspective, is the introduction of Material Design. Google introduced Material Design in 2014 as the default design language on Android. It is, undoubtedly, an improvement over what had come before, but its principles are not universally applied, and don’t necessarily make apps easier to use in every case.</p>
<p>I don’t think Material Design has had a big effect on how Android apps are designed or used. Some indie developers never bothered to adopt it. Even on apps from big companies with large, talented, and nimble development teams, screen layouts are still dominated by hamburger buttons and slide-out menus, which leads to tedious navigation between parts of an app, and low discovery of key features. Also, sharing information between apps is still run through the same kind of share sheets used in 2011, which, ironically enough, can’t be customized as much as iOS share sheets can.</p>
<p>After a month or so of Android use, I concluded that Android runs more smoothly on high-end hardware than it did five years ago, but it is practically unchanged from a user experience perspective. As an iOS user, this is shocking, because iOS is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->completely<!-- raw HTML omitted --> different than it was in 2011.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Back when I used the Droid, Android was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->way ahead<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of Apple for many software features: the notification shade, quick settings on the notification shade, text selection, voice input, customizability, and, most of all, app extensibility (data sharing between apps, mostly) were <!-- raw HTML omitted -->way better<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on Android than on iOS. It would be fair to say that, in terms of user-facing features, iOS had a lot more ground to cover than Android did to improve <!-- raw HTML omitted -->certain aspects<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of user experience. My assessment now, with an Essential Phone and an iPhone 7 Plus at my disposal, is that Apple’s slow and steady advancement of iOS has allowed it to catch up to Android in all these areas, and exceed it in many of them.</p>
<p>The overall user interface design on iOS changed significantly in iOS 7, and has been refined and expanded upon in each iOS release since. Apple stole good user interface ideas from Android, such as the notification shade and the control center, but designed them differently and refined them each year, and implemented its own means of app extensibility in iOS 8, which has been slowly expanding in capabilities and usefulness year by year. An extensive number of indie developers’ embrace of x-callback-url for app extensibility has been a huge driver of inter-app communication and automation. App extensions, introduced by Apple in iOS 8, have matured into a cohesive ecosystem that does wonders for various workflows, especially those involving text and images. Apple’s Files app in iOS 11 allows third party storage providers, such as Dropbox, to have first-party-level integration with the OS and any apps that support the Files API. It is actually simple and seamless to use Dropbox with all sorts of iOS apps that were not written to support it. In this regard, Android is stuck in the same world as iOS 11 and earlier, where file service can be integrated, but each integration feels looser, more like a bolt-on feature or an afterthought.</p>
<p>It’s easy to think that iOS has been stagnant for many years because you still can’t arrange your app icons in arbitrary patterns on the screen, or change your default email app. If you can look beyond those customization points, you will see an enormous evolution in design and functionality on iOS, which is unmatched on the Android side.</p>

			 <p>As an iOS developer, my job is never done, even though my app, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SwiftoDo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is internally simple and focused. There are always more features to add. There is competition in the App Store to worry about. There are third party libraries that deal with that break from time to time or have APIs change. Most of all, there is the regular drumbeat of regular iOS updates, which, frustratingly, can break standard UI controls and behaviors, and new hardware to support.</p>
<p>What I like about having my own iOS app is the act of creating something unique, something I actually use every day, and supporting other people who want to use it to. It is a lot of work, but it is also a lot of fun—except for migrating between Swift versions every year; that part I could do without, and hopefully the changes will be more minor as time goes on.</p>
<p>Right now I am trying to knock out several features that have been in development since this summer, and get it all done before Apple no longer supports builds from Xcode 8.3.3. I think, when I finally upgrade to Xcode 9 and do yet another Swift version upgrade of my code, I will drop support for iOS 9, and bump the minimum supported iOS version up to iOS 10.3, or maybe even iOS 11.0. I hate to do that, but support for the older SDK is probably causing me more trouble than it is worth at this point. Still, I don’t want to leave my iOS 9 users with an app that is broken or unstable in any way. That is why I have delayed dropping support so long now.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/10/09/contexts-in-getting.html">Contexts in Getting Things Done and todo.txt</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/10/09/contexts-in-getting.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-10-09 22:00:00 -0500">Oct 9, 2017</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One of the great insights of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Getting Things Done<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (GTD) system is that tasks not only have projects, but contexts as well. A context is, basically, a thing or place or situation you need in order to do a task. Examples include: @home, @work, @phone, @computer, @errands, and so on. With projects and tasks, you can visualize your task list as a two-dimensional grid, with one row per project, and one column per context. This helps you determine what your next action should be. You can only do the tasks that are in the context you are currently in. That’s great, right?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Well&hellip;what I have found is that the typical set of contexts outlined in the “Getting Things Done” book are not really that useful to me. I only use my task list for work, so I’m always “@work”. I do all my work on a computer, which is portable, so I’m always “@computer”. I always have my mobile phone on me, so I’m always “@phone”. After diligently typing out these contexts in my todo.txt file and later ignoring them, for a long, long time, I realized that doing so was pointless. I only work in one context, so why bother to track it?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This was not immediately obvious to me because I was trying really hard to be a faithful GTD practitioner, and do everything that entails completely and correctly. When I realized that one of GTD’s key tools, the context, was useless to me, I felt lost. After rereading the “Getting Things Done” book, and trying even harder to commit to the system, I finally threw in the towel on contexts: I stopped using them entirely, for several years.</p>
<p>Doing so felt weird at first, and then liberating, like removing a little stumbling block from every task I wrote. I realized that following the system is not the important thing: getting my work done efficiently is the important thing. There was no point to keep adding contexts to tasks that did not need them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What I learned, obviously enough, is that not using contexts in GTD is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fine<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It doesn’t matter that it isn’t “pure” GTD. The system doesn’t matter; the results matter. If using contexts is just a minor drag on productivity, drop them and don’t give it a second thought.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After not using contexts for a few years, the nature of my work changed, and, as a consequence, I discovered new uses for them. My prior job entailed leading rather lengthy one-off audits, start to finish, with little commonality between them. My current job had me working mainly on data analytics procedures within over fifty similar audits, all performed over a several year period. Because of the highly structured nature of this work, and the tighter timeframes for producing deliverables, I sought to add more structure to my task list system. Contexts helped me do that.</p>
<p>The breakthrough for me was when I started using contexts to indicate phases of work (@planning, @development, @analysis, @reporting), and people I was working with (@Jo, @Susan, @Craig). These contexts had nothing to do with time, place, or equipment. Instead, they had to do with mental state (the type of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->thinking<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I had to do) and relationships with my coworkers. I am not always in the right mindset to perform a particular type of work (say, rigorous data analysis), and the people I am working with have different availability and expectations, so it is useful for me to keep track of those things in my task list.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Todo.txt lets you manage your tasks using several axes: project and context, which tie directly to GTD concepts; and priority, which does not (though it is helpful to consider priority “A” your GTD “next action” indicator). While I have not come across any software that outputs your todo.txt file as a two-dimensional grid, pretty much all todo.txt apps have effective sorting and filtering capabilities. I filter and sort by todo.txt list on project and context numerous times throughout the day (mainly using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SwiftoDo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on my iPad), as I complete tasks and try to identify my next actions. Sorting and filtering on project and context, and diligently setting and resetting priorities, helps me stay productive and avoid letting things fall through the cracks every day.</p>

			 <p>I am a huge fan of managing my tasks using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->plaintext<!-- raw HTML omitted --> files. I mostly use todo.txt, but I have recently learned about the TaskPaper format. This is what I have learned about both formats.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Both todo.txt and TaskPaper formats are, of course, plaintext files. You can open them in any text editor on any platform. There are several clients available on each of the major computing platforms specifically built to handle them. None of the clients controls your data or is able to lock you in. You are free to organize your task list any way you wish, and even to have multiple task list files. Both formats offer different ways to define projects and tasks, and both have some kind of tagging support, which helps in filtering tasks. You can also have multiple task list files, though most clients work with only one file at a time. Last, but not least, you are on your own when it comes to syncing your task list across systems. Dropbox is the most common third-party file sync service.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Todo.txt is a simple flat-file format—just a list of tasks, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in a particular format<!-- raw HTML omitted -->—that was initially built for command-line querying. It acts as a junk drawer that you can throw stuff into and easily get out later through sorting, filtering, and searching. It is for the sort of person who, for example, archives all their email into one folder, figuring it can be found later with search, rather than those who file every message into an elaborate folder tree. It works for me because I tend to have dozens, and sometimes hundreds, of tasks at a time, spread across a variety of projects, with only minor dependencies between them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are many todo.txt compatible apps on all the major platforms. I created <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SwiftoDo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (iOS) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SwiftoDo Desktop<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (macOS), which are todo.txt apps highly focused on filtering and sorting tasks, and allowing for easy updating and reprioritizing. On Windows, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->todotxt.net<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is my favorite client. I sync them all via <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dropbox<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. As long as you have a good client, like the ones I mention above, the todo.txt format is especially good for entering and managing large amounts of tasks, and rapidly reprioritizing them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TaskPaper format<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is much simpler than todo.txt’s format. It is a multi-level outline that includes support for tags and notes&hellip;and that’s it. It uses tags for just about everything: project, context, priority, due date, completed status, etc.</p>
<p>Because it is an outline, I find that the TaskPaper format is superior to todo.txt for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->planning<!-- raw HTML omitted -->—either project planning or simple day planning in my work journal. Having different outline levels makes it easy to see how tasks are grouped, ordered, and inter-dependent.</p>
<p>These strengths as an outliner are weaknesses, for me at least, when it comes to working through my task list, finding my next actions, and adjusting priorities to reflect what I need to work on next. The outline and order of tasks feels fixed in TaskPaper files, and it feels somewhat unnatural to sort and filter them. It is possible to flag all of the tasks to do today with a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@today<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tag and filter the file to show them. I prefer to work with one very short TaskPaper file for the day, containing only the few tasks I plan to do that day, and mark tasks complete as the day progresses.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->TaskPaper’s<!-- raw HTML omitted --> macOS app is, as you would expect from the creator of the file format, the gold standard TaskPaper editor. It is clean, well thought-out, and deceptively simple. It has powerful outlining and filtering features that I admire, and extensive keyboard shortcuts that cover everything.</p>
<p>Because I have to work on Windows, I mostly use a bastardized version of TaskPaper format in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sublime Text<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, using the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PlainTasks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> plugin. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Editorial<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on iOS is the best mobile app I have found that supports the format. It looks like the next version of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Drafts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will do so in the near future, as well. In my opinion, outside macOS, you are best off using a text editor for TaskPaper files.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Both todo.txt and TaskPaper are useful tools in the plaintext toolbox. I use todo.txt to manage all my tasks, but I use TaskPaper to plan new projects or to outline priorities for my workday.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/09/15/deciding-whether-to.html">Deciding Whether to Upgrade to the iPhone X</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last year, prior to Apple’s announcement of the iPhone 7, I had hoped for the “all-screen” design that was announced last week for the iPhone X. I was sure that would be my next phone. Now that it is here, one year later, I am not sure if I want it—at least not yet.</p>
<p>As an iPhone Upgrade Plan customer, I have three options at my disposal:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The iPhone X starts at $999. The model with more storage that I would buy is $150 more, and AppleCare Plus costs about $200 on top of that. That represents a huge outlay for the phone. I don’t begrudge Apple for pricing the iPhone X so high, or other people for buying it without worrying about its cost. The high price is, however, a hint that the X may not be for me—at least not this year.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While I love the idea of “renting” a smartphone with a fixed monthly cost (hardware as a service), it doesn’t really work that way. You actually have to buy the phone, and deal with the downsides that entails.</p>
<p>When I upgraded to the iPhone 7, I was surprised that I would have to pay 100% of the taxes on the new phone (about $100), plus a fee to activate it on my Verizon account (about $20). I had been thinking only about the difference in the monthly phone payment I would make, which was minuscule, and the expected cost to buy a new, compatible case. I was out over $100 for the new phone, and realized that I had already paid those costs one year earlier for the 7, and was giving up that hardware completely. On top of that, the case cost a lot, too (about $50). It is easy to forget about these costs when (1) the cost of the phone dwarfs them, and (2) the main cost of the phone is a relatively small monthly payment.</p>
<p>This year, wiser about the switching costs, I am just not sure if it is worth it to go from the 7 to the 8 Plus or X.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Coming from the Plus, the iPhone X actually represents a step down in screen size (though it has a higher native resolution), lacks Touch ID, and has a smaller battery. I am not sure how my apps will look on the iPhone X screen. I bet developers will have to figure out how best to handle the notch and curved corners. (I am a little worried about my iOS app, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SwiftoDo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, too.) Face ID might be slower or less convenient than Touch ID. Battery life might not be as good as on my one-year old, heavily used iPhone 7 Plus, or even the new iPhone 8 Plus.</p>
<p>Considering these minor drawbacks and unknowns, it might be nice to sit out the period in which users and developers figure out the new hardware, and Apple fixes any iPhone X-related software bugs.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The iPhone 8 Plus is actually pretty attractive, despite having the same old (but good!) case design as the iPhone 6, 6S, and 7. I’m sure demand for it will be rather low, by iPhone standards. I would actually be able to get one soon. It is at least $300 cheaper than the iPhone X. The model I want costs $949, which is really expensive, but my monthly iPhone Upgrade Plan payment would not change.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If money were no object, I would buy the X outright sometime soon and never use the iPhone Upgrade Plan again. Because that is not the case, I am leaning most heavily towards skipping an upgrade this year. I will deal with decreasing battery life and knowing I don’t have the best camera or performance anymore, but I will not suffer much. Or, I may just order the iPhone 8 Plus and not worry about the X until next year. I will go to an Apple Store in the next few weeks to test my resolve.</p>

<p>I was surprised to learn the news, because I have been using Sublime Text 3 since 2013. Those were betas, of course, but were more solid and stable than most production software I used. I have been using beta versions for so long, I basically forgot that a final release would ever be forthcoming. There was, famously, about a year over which there were no beta updates, but the developer pulled through more recently with more frequent updates and meaningful new features (like High DPI support). Now, after several years of development, the release is marked complete.</p>
<p>I am a huge fan of this text editor. I use it constantly for many things. I even wrote popular articles about it in my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Plaintext Productivity<!-- raw HTML omitted --> guide. Congratulations to the developer for wrapping up the release.</p>
<p>Now is a good time to buy a license, or pursue an upgrade. My 2013 Sublime Text 2 purchase qualified me for a free upgrade, so I am a very happy customer now.</p>

			 <p>There is news today that Apple&rsquo;s next-generation iPhone—the rumored high-end one—is not only going to remove the physical home button (everyone has assumed that for a while), but it will also not replace it with an on-screen simulacrum (people like me have expected a circle icon to act as the home button). The plan, apparently, is to kill the home button entirely, and replace it with a dock of icons, like the iOS 11 betas have on the iPad. That is a bit surprising to me. Whether it is true or not, this news made me want to pause a minute and reflect on how brilliant Apple&rsquo;s home button was.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As the one, single button on the front of the phone, it was the ultimate escape key. Can&rsquo;t find an exit app button onscreen? Did an app hang? Does an app confuse you? Is the screen black for no reason? Just press the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->only physical button on the front of the phone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and return to the home screen.</p>
<p>It sounds so simple and obvious, but no one else had anything quite like it. (OK, Samsung copied it soon afterward, but that barely counts.) Most Android phones came with &ldquo;soft buttons&rdquo;, onscreen buttons or tap-able areas below the screen. But there were more of them–remember back, home, menu, and search?–or they had weird, almost meaningless icons-square, circle, triangle-that you had to figure out.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A side benefit of a physical home button was that you could feel it with your thumb, and always know which way you were holding the phone by touch alone. When it inevitably goes away, I will miss the familiar sensation of finding it when the phone is in my pocket, to orient my hand and to use as a pivot as I swing the phone around to use it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Over time, the home button was overloaded to do multitasking and Touch ID, but it always served its original purpose, and Apple never screwed it up, even with its non-moving, Taptic Engine-driven style in the iPhone 7. (That phone&rsquo;s haptic feedback feels incredible.)</p>
<p>Obviously, Android&rsquo;s early move from physical buttons to soft-buttons approach worked out all right, but, to me, Apple&rsquo;s stalwart refusal to ditch the physical home button over many generations of iPhone reflected, in my opinion, a design ethic centered upon simplicity and humanism, which I really respected.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sorry to see (presumably) the home button go, but it was definitely one of the reasons I admired the design of the iPhone, and ditched my Android phone for one years ago.</p>

			 <p>It seems that many programmers who are actually <!-- raw HTML omitted -->programming<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on iPads are writing code that runs elsewhere, either on a web server, or on a remote system they SSH into. That doesn&rsquo;t describe what I do anymore. My non-work programming has shifted almost entirely to Swift, due to my obvious love of Apple platforms and my love of the language. This makes the iPad Pro less than useful for my programming needs.</p>
<p>I code in Xcode. Developers have been awaiting Xcode for iPad for years now, despite nearly nothing coming out of Cupertino to indicate that this will ever happen. Xcode on iPad would be great, I guess, but it seems too big and too complicated for me to even contemplate on iOS. I don&rsquo;t think I would even want to develop full apps on the iPad, but I would love to work on models, custom subclasses to iOS controls, and creating unit tests, even when I&rsquo;m away from my MacBook.</p>
<p>I know Swift Playgrounds exists, but I really wish there was something more fully-featured than it available. It doesn&rsquo;t let me export my work to anywhere I can use it, which is the largest problem. I know I could code Swift on an simple text editor on the iPad, but what I really want is a compiler. Coding in Xcode is like having a conversation with the compiler, and seeing what it will allow you to do. I like that. I wish I could do that on the iPad, perhaps in a multi-file playground and export it to a Git client like Working Copy. I could get a ton of work done that way, without even trying to build and test a full app.</p>
<p>Perhaps Apple will make me happy this fall, when iOS 11 is finalized, or next year with iOS 12.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Setting up a new iPad is an opportunity to start over with a clean slate, and fix whatever problems you have on your old device&rsquo;s setup. Fortunately, operating stability tends not to be a problem these days. What is a problem, however, is the sheer number of apps you can end up having installed, and the many notifications that come with them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The App Store started out with a Unix-like philosophy about software. Remember the phrase “there’s an app for that?” Most apps did one thing. Most people do a lot of things, so we end up with a whole lot of apps. Not much has changed over time. Springboard, the launcher on iOS, is deliberately primitive. All your apps are spread out across various home screen pages. Once you have more than two or three pages, it is really hard to remember where all your apps are. Apps can be grouped into folders, but once in folders they are harder to find, unless you have a good organizational strategy.</p>
<p>With a new device, such as my new iPad Pro, I simply don’t install apps unless I need them right then. For those apps that get installed, I reduce their notifications to a bare minimum. If you get notifications on your phone, and you always have your phone with you, do you really need them on your iPad? Probably not.</p>
<p>Even after doing these smart-sounding things, I have 72 applications on my iPad Pro (and this is a machine with zero games on it!). Because of this, I often use Spotlight search to launch apps. I do this on my iPhone, too, where it feels inferior to tapping an icon. I’m learning, however, that on the iPad, just as on my Mac, it’s the right way to do it.</p>
<p>(I probably use about ten productivity apps most of the time, and those apps will likely be in the Dock once I install iOS 11, but I still use at least 20 of those other apps on a daily basis for reading, scanning, and videos.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With the keyboard, just like on a Mac. Simply hit Command+Space to launch Spotlight, type the first few letters of an app&rsquo;s name, and hit Enter. Without a hardware keyboard, pull down on the home screen to launch Spotlight, and type with the onscreen keyboard.</p>
<p>This behavior is fast and efficient. As a side benefit, it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->drastically<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reduces the need to organize apps efficiently on the SpringBoard.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I tried briefly to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> organize the Springboard at all, but I ended up with several pages of apps and it looked like a jumbled mess. So I went into the other direction: I put <!-- raw HTML omitted -->everything<!-- raw HTML omitted --> into folders, all of which fit on one screen. The folder names are all verbs, based on activities:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Other verbs, such as “research” and “listen”, may be useful for folder names in the future, if my hobbies and/or media diet increase.</p>
<p>The apps within the folders are not organized. Unless I have more than 16 apps in a folder, all the icons are visible at once, and their order does not matter to me.</p>
<p>My Dock contains the six apps I use all the time throughout my work day: Safari, Overcast, Music, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SwiftoDo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (my todo.txt task list), Drafts, and Ulysses. When I put iOS 11 on this machine, my use of the Dock will change somewhat, mostly by allowing me to put more apps in it.</p>
<p>(I don’t have a junk or “Apple” folder for unused and unloved default apps anymore. Since iOS 10, you can remove (hide, really) Apple’s default apps that you don&rsquo;t use. I just do that.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This organization scheme is working out very well for me. It helps keep me focused on what I’m doing and what I intend to do, and kind of forces me to use Spotlight to both launch and switch between apps, which is the behavior I want to reinforce. (It is still ingrained in me, based on how iOS worked prior to multitasking, to close an app and go to the home screen to switch apps, but it is not necessary to do so, and it is faster not to.)</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/08/22/choosing-an-ipad.html">Choosing an iPad Pro Case and Stand</a></h1>

			 <p>Having given up on a keyboard case, I felt adrift in subpar options for an iPad stand and case. I admit, it is not that hard to get something decent; most people would just buy an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Smart Cover<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (or a decent knockoff) and be done with it. I, however, wanted something very specific, something I had in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my old iPad Air 2 case<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is apparently rare: a kickstand.</p>
<p>The reason is that the kickstand made my iPad feel rock solid. It never moved or wobbled on a table. It never fell down because the folded up case collapsed beneath it. It felt real and solid, like a high quality tool rather than a fragile slice of glass and metal.</p>
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Logitech Create<!-- raw HTML omitted --> keyboard case (which I didn&rsquo;t like) had a kickstand, but nothing else I could find at the Apple Store or on Amazon did. Apple&rsquo;s Smart Cover seemed expensive and far worse as a stand than what I had for my old iPad. There was a charging stand, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Logi Base<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that looked like a good, sturdy platform, but was overpriced, had a number of unfavorable user reviews, and was not a case at all, so it was an incomplete solution. I basically didn&rsquo;t want to spend so much on either case or stand, but after lots of thinking and comparison shopping, I bit the bullet and bought them both. I am very happy I did.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Logi Base<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, once you get over the initial cost of it, is unexpectedly great. It&rsquo;s a stand that charges the iPad through the Smart Connector. Unlike a folded-up Smart Cover, it is rock solid. It basically sticks to the desk, and provides the iPad a secure backing. You can bang the screen with your fingers and it would not move. That, for me, is key. A wobbly iPad feels like a toy. A secure one feels like the future of computing.</p>
<p>Docking and undocking are simple: a strong magnet helps keep everything in place. Charging through the Smart Connector works just fine. Numerous product reviewers complained that charging is slow and doesn&rsquo;t support fast charging. Perhaps that is true, but charging is fast enough to keep up with battery use, and then some, which is all I actually need.</p>
<p>The final thing that delights me about the Base is that it actually gives me a place for the Pencil. It has a tiny amount of ledge space in front of the iPad that is just big enough for the Pencil to rest on its side. There is just enough magnetism there (it is near the Smart Connector) to keep the Pencil there rather safely.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While a stand is nice for desktop use, you still should have something to protect the iPad&rsquo;s screen sometimes. I bought the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Smart Cover<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for travel, whether around town or around the house. I actually take it off (you have to) and store it in a desk drawer when the iPad Pro is on the Logi stand. I did spend more on it than it is worth to me, but when I ordered it, cheaper third party cases were not widely available yet. I find that I take the Smart Cover off when actually using the iPad, and put it back on when I put the iPad away. That&rsquo;s different than how I&rsquo;ve treated every other iPad/case combination I&rsquo;ve owned, largely due to the difference in size and weight between the 9.7&quot; and 12.9&quot; iPads.</p>
<p>All in all, I am happier using the iPad with no case, and it stays on the Logi Base at my desk most of the time anyway.</p>

			 <p>iPads are great for writing, but if you are a touch typist, you need an external keyboard to have a top-notch experience.</p>
<p>I am a touch typist, and used to be a very fast touch typist as well, until RSI (repetitive stress injury) slowed me down to more reasonable speeds. Due to RSI, and the fact that using an ill-suited keyboard physically <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hurts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I am very picky about keyboards. I prefer a keyboard that is clicky and gives me a precise feeling when the key is activated. Mushy keyboards, by contrast, are awful for me; my accuracy decreases, and retyping increases. Key spacing basically has to be as close to a full-size key board as possible for me, because my hands cramp up when typing on anything smaller than a standard MacBook keyboard. Travel distance is important, too. Too little throw on a keyboard, such as on the first generation 12&quot; MacBook, makes my fingers hurt.</p>
<p>As I said, I am hard to please when it comes to keyboards.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Trying out these two keyboards, however, quickly led to disappointment. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Smart Keyboard<!-- raw HTML omitted --> just felt awkward to type on. It has very little tactile feedback, and almost no throw. It is floppy enough to be poorly suited for use on the lap (which, admittedly, would be rare). The case it comes attached to is slim, versatile, lightweight (for what it is, not overall), andstylish. But, alas, it is not for me.</p>
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Logitech Create Backlit Keyboard<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, at first, appears to correct all of the Apple Smart Keyboard&rsquo;s shortcomings. It has real keys! It has decent key travel! It has a sturdy kickstand case instead of a floppy folding case! While it has real keys, and more features plus a lower price than the Apple Smart Keyboard, typing on one for a while felt awful to me. It started to feel mushy to me. It is also much heavier than the Smart Keyboard. I loved the kickstand, but I wanted something I could remove more easily, because the 12.9&quot; iPad Pro is heavy enough on its own when used handheld.</p>
<p>So, after lots of time trying them out, both Smart Connector keyboards were out of the running for me.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After trying out and being disappointed by the typing experience on the Apple and Logitech Smart Connector keyboards, I went back to my favorite keyboard of recent years, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Magic Keyboard<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s a full-size keyboard, which is comfortable to type on. It has a shallow keyfall distance, but it is not as shallow as the 12&quot; MacBook. Keypresses feel solid and clicky. The battery lasts for months. Build quality is top notch.</p>
<p>I have not had any problems with dropped keystrokes when waking up the Magic Keyboard, but that is likely because my new iPad Pro itself goes to sleep, which is an option I had disabled on my old iPad. Whatever the reason, a single keypress wakes up the iPad Pro and I go on to typing without thinking about it. That&rsquo;s good enough for me.</p>
<p>So, after an honest effort to upgrade to on of the Smart Connector keyboards, I passed on both of them, and settled for the Apple Magic Keyboard, because it offers the best typing experience for me. I am actually surprised about that, and a little disappointed that I did not like the other two options. Because I went with a detached keyboard, I had to consider different case and stand options, which I will go into in a later post.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a definite trade-off between size and portability when choosing between the two sizes of iPad Pro. The 10.5&quot; version is lighter and more portable—it&rsquo;s essentially the same as the familiar 9.7&quot; model. The 12.9&quot; version is heavier and has a larger screen, and, unfortunately, has larger bezels as well (it is the same size as the prior 12.9&quot; model).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The smaller iPad Pro <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> nicer to hold in your hands for long periods of time. Even more importantly, if you read books on it in bed, where the screen is only about 12&quot; away from your eyes, as I do, it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> easier to read on. Because you can focus on the whole screen at once, you don&rsquo;t need to move your eyes as much. It is small, but it is perfectly usable for productivity as well as videos and reading.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The larger iPad Pro is, in my opinion, an even better size for getting work done. The 12.9&quot; screen, when paired with a hardware keyboard, feels like a computer screen for productivity apps. It&rsquo;s barely smaller than my old 13.3&quot; MacBook. There is plenty of room for multitasking and slide-over. It also feels even better for handwriting and drawing, because the usable screen area is basically the same size as a standard piece of paper (i.e., A4 or Letter size), which feels natural.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Does the additional size and weight make it less useful as a tablet? In short: yes, but only a little.</p>
<p>The 12.9&quot; iPad Pro (2017 model) weighs about as much as the iPad 4th generation (about 1.5 lbs), so weight is not really a problem for handheld use, at least when held without a case. Apple&rsquo;s Smart Cover comes off easily, so you could just take it off to read with for long periods of time, and put it back on when you want to protect the screen. Also, the weight is very well balanced, so you can hold it in one hand comfortably despite its size.</p>
<p>As for reading in bed or in an easy chair, the larger model is slightly worse. It&rsquo;s more natural to read such a large screen at an arm&rsquo;s length away, rather than perched on your stomach or thereabouts. The large screen has the same DPI as the smaller iPad Pro, so crispness at that distance is not a problem. It&rsquo;s just too big to focus on the whole thing evenly, unless it&rsquo;s about as far from your eyes as your laptop screen normally would be. (This is, obviously, a very small problem in the grand scheme of things.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One reason behind my purchase of a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->12.9&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> iPad Pro was that I realized that I didn&rsquo;t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->necessarily<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have to give up my old 9.7&quot; iPad Air after doing so. Sure, it might be the smart thing to get back $100 or so by selling it, or it might be nice to give it to someone else in my family, but it is still worth a lot more to me than it is to somebody else. (I admit, it does help that my kids are too young to care about electronic devices.) This decision made it much easier to go for the larger-sized tablet.</p>
<p>So, if you already have a smaller-than-12.9&quot; iPad, like I do? Honestly, if you can get away with it, keep the old iPad around for reading and use the new, larger one for desktop use.</p>

			 <p>When iOS 11 and the new iPad Pro were announced at this year&rsquo;s WWDC, I was very excited and more than a little confused. I was excited because the hardware looked fantastic, and I knew I was going to buy one. I was confused because iOS 11 made me no longer know what the iPad was for.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Long before WWDC 2017, I decided I would use some of the earnings from my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iOS app<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mac app<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (todo.txt task lists, under the name SwiftoDo) to upgrade my iPad Air 2 to the newest model—whatever Apple would release next. I had hopes for a larger-screen, smaller bezel iPad, which ended up being the 10.5&quot; iPad Pro.</p>
<p>Even though the tech press has decried slow iPad sales for years now, I absolutely <!-- raw HTML omitted -->love<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the iPad. I use one for music, podcasts, videos, writing, Twitter, web browsing, and reading at least 8 hours every day. (It helps that I work from home.) I love the screen. I love the touch interface. I love driving it with a Bluetooth keyboard. I love how native apps can deliver a superior experience to web pages. I even love <!-- raw HTML omitted -->developing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> apps for the platform.</p>
<p>Since I purchased my 2013 MacBook Pro, I have bought three iPads (not counting the Pro model I was considering) and zero MacBook Pros. This year I was not really due for an upgrade, but I use the iPad so much, I decided it was worth it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Despite my general iPad Pro excitement, I was also confused, because iOS 11 looked to me like a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->computer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> operating system, rather than a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tablet<!-- raw HTML omitted --> operating system. iOS 11&rsquo;s new app launching dock, file-oriented architecture, and extensive drag-and-drop support gave me the impression that it made the iPad more like the next generation of Mac, rather than a tablet.</p>
<p>This is important because, to me, and iPad is way more intimate a product than a computer. I read on it at the breakfast table and in bed. I listen to music all day at work, and sometimes just have it display a big clock or the blank text area of a note-taking app. These are things I would never dedicate an entire laptop to. But a tablet is small, low power, and low stress.</p>
<p>I installed a developer beta of iOS 11 on my iPad Air 2 to get an idea of how the new UI worked. I also visited my local Apple Store to look at the 10.5&quot; iPad Pros the day they were released. I actually walked right right past them; the store had replaced all the 9.7&quot; models with 10.5&quot; models, and I could barely tell the difference. After a minute I found the 2017 9.7&quot; iPad (the new budget/consumer model) and a new 2017 10.5&quot; iPad Pro side by side. The difference in size was more slight than I had imagined. The larger size was obviously an improvement over my iPad Air 2 screen, but it didn&rsquo;t feel like a big enough difference to warrant an upgrade. I was actually a little upset, because I really wanted to upgrade to the newest iPad, but the 10.5&quot; model did not seem much better than the iPad Air 2.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What dawned on me at the Apple Store was that iOS 11 would make the 12.9&quot; iPad Pro, which I had previously thought was ridiculously oversized, very attractive. With a keyboard, it would be a much better <!-- raw HTML omitted -->desktop computer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> than the 10.5&quot; model. Without a keyboard, and indeed without a case, it would light enough to hold while reading in bed, and not really too large for that either. It would have better software and require less maintenance than my MacBook Pro, and would be a lot more fun to use. So I played with one for a while and decided to buy it.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m writing this blog post on it, and plan to write more about the other hardware I bought to go along with it, and the changes I made to its software. It&rsquo;s a wonderful device, and is clearly, with iOS 11 on the horizon, the next iteration of the Mac.</p>

			 <p>Somewhat to my surprise, I have started coding a new text editor for iOS. I usually have no ideas for new apps.

<p>My goal is to write an app that is very simple, configurable (by normal people, not JavaScript programmers), and rock solid, which will be useful for me for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->planning and tracking things at work<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

Even if that&rsquo;s the case, that&rsquo;s not such a bad thing to create.</p>

			 <p>First posts are often hopeful paeans to blogging, and promises to post regularly. This isn&rsquo;t such a post. This blog is a project, or small set of projects, and that is all. Like all things, this stream of thoughts will eventually run its course.</p>
<p>I was inspired to start a new blog by Manton Reece and Daniel Jalkut, who discuss blogging and Apple programming on their excellent podcast &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Core Intiution<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;. I hope to tie it to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Micro.blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sometime soon, once that service launches.</p>
<p>So, here it is. There is more to come.</p>
