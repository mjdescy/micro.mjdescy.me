        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have two collections that I love but cannot justify: high-end headphones (each is sub-$500, but still really expensive and good) and mechanical keyboards (each is $240 or less). It took ten years to build up these collections, so the embarrassing amount of money I have spent is spread out over a long, long period. I was wondering today if people who spend a lot more than I do on vacations do so because they forego (and don’t care about) material objects like pricy headphones and keyboards.</p>

<p>Getting into these “hobbies” (if buying stuff can be called a hobby) was entirely accidental. I’m part of a product review program where I can occasionally select products I like for no money up front, and then only pay taxes on their value months later. I got my first taste of better headphones and better keyboards through that program, essentially through the luck of the draw. (I’m not in charge of which products become available for me to review.) If not for that, I probably would have no other headphones other than my AirPods, and would probably have a $100 Microsoft or Logitech keyboard that I would have to replace (because of wear) every year or two.</p>

<p>I think I am finally nearing “endgame” in both of these categories. I have fantastic headphones of nearly every type (dynamic and planar magnetic, open-back and closed-back, Bluetooth and wired), and they cover every situation, that I need. Similarly, I have mechanical keyboards for all of my computers, have tried a bunch of different key switches (clicky, tactile, and linear), and have even bought a “weird” ortholinear board that I never thought I would ever want until a couple months ago. Any new keyboard purchases are going to be about fixing something that is broken (my wonderful and unacceptably buggy Durgod tenkeyless) or trying out a different type of keyswitch on my new, hot-swappable ortholinear board. At least I hope that will be the case. Collecting more and more of these objects sometimes feels like an obsession, and is not something I want to keep doing forever.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have worked from home for more than half of my career. I’m no stranger to working in an office, but I find myself wondering what people actually do at work all day. I always imagine that my coworkers are more focused on their tasks than I am, or more driven to earn a promotion, or more highly structured in their approach to managing their work than I am.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure, though, that that <em>can’t</em> be, because no one I have ever worked with in person was much more focused that I was, with the exception of one or two workaholic bosses I’ve had. <em>Those</em> guys loved their job in ways I couldn’t replicate—at least that’s what I thought—and that drove them to work well into the evenings every day, after I was ready to go home.</p>

<p>My last office-job experience was mostly great, but there was a lot of gossip, walking around, waiting for elevators, waiting for meetings to begin, going out to grab a coffee, and so on. Half of my day was spent on actual work, even though I spent almost the entire day with my team, doing the same things they were doing. When I worked from home on that job, I got a lot more done, even though I would take break to make my coffee or put a load of laundry in the washing machine.</p>

<p>My job today is different than any of the office-based ones. It is more fluid and unpredictable in nature; every day is different than the last, and some of my projects are vastly different from others. The sands are always shifting beneath my feet. I would prefer my job to be more predictable, for my mental health, more than anything. I think that it is probably anxiety more than anything else that makes me think, pretty frequently, that I’m not working hard enough, or as hard as my peers, or that it took me too much time to do a certain task I was asked to do.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have been fascinated by this <a href="https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/07/a-chemical-hunger-part-i-mysteries/">anonymously published paper/series of articles about the obesity epidemic</a>. <a href="https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/07/a-chemical-hunger-part-i-mysteries/">Part I</a>, covering mysteries about obesity that I did and did <em>not</em> know about, drew me in. The authors’ thesis, which isn’t presented until <a href="https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/13/a-chemical-hunger-part-iii-environmental-contaminants/">Part III</a>, is that chemical contaminants are the primary cause of the epidemic (not why individuals gain weight, but why obesity in entire populations increased dramatically since 1980). I’m not sure I buy that, but it is an interesting argument to consider that I had not previously given any weight to.</p>

<p>I was interested this that work because I am struggling with my weight again due to the pandemic. Since January 2020, when reading the news from Wuhan caused me to have a a panic attack about the coming pandemic (I was right, unfortunately). When COVID panic hit the US, and the store shelves were bare, businesses and sports leagues were shutting down, and we were afraid to leave our houses, I started to eat sweets or drink beer (just one a day) as a way to cope with the uncertainty and stress.</p>

<p>I gave up the beer last September, but giving up sweets entirely has been impossible for me thus far. Sugar is a habit I have given up several times in my life, but I always go back to it when I am feeling very bad, like if I get sick or if stressful situations last too long. The pandemic has basically never stopped being stressful for me or my family. Dealing with that stress takes a ton of energy away from me, and I end up eating extra food—sweet food—for the boost of energy it gives me. I feel a chemical dependence on it now that is stronger than I recall it being at any point in my life. I want to give it up, and am trying to find the mental resolve to do so this week.</p>

         	<p>Today I did too many chores, then did way too little of <em>anything</em>, and ended up eating too much ice cream this evening.</p>

<p>I should give myself a break because our plans for today were canceled at the last minute. Still, I wish I could wake up on the weekend and just have <em>fun</em>, or at the very least take up the unstructured time I sometimes have on a Saturday or Sunday and do something productive with it. I have tons of writing projects on my hands, and did not work on any of it today.</p>

<p>I <em>did</em> bake bread and cook chicken noodle soup for my family, so the day wasn’t a total loss. Hopefully I use tomorrow in a more worthwhile way.</p>

         	<p>I have temporarily stopped practicing on, or changing to, the ColeMak-DH keyboard layout. I haven’t been using my new Planck-EZ keyboard at all. I am still too slow with that layout to use it for “real” writing, and I have been writing and writing and writing for the past couple weeks.</p>

<p>I think I am still very excited about moving to the Planck and to a non-QWERTY layout. But I am more excited about my writing projects right now.</p>

<p>I plan to pick up Colemak-DH and the Planck keyboard again in a couple weeks, which is around my birthday, because I believe that my need for fast typing will abate by then. The Planck keyboard was supposed to be a birthday present, anyway.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>On a whim this weekend I purchased the beat ‘em up game <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-the-game-complete-edition-switch/"><em>Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World</em></a> for the Nintendo Switch. It was an impulse purchase of a game I had not heard of and didn’t know was any good. I have been wanting to play a brawler for a while, but it is a genre I have not played since I was a kid, so I was not sure I would still enjoy it. I have been eyeing, but have been reluctant to spend $30 of $25 on, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/river-city-girls-switch/"><em>River City Girls</em></a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/streets-of-rage-4-switch/"><em>Streets of Rage 4</em></a> for weeks now. I haven’t played a game in that genre since I was a kid, and as an adult I am terrible at a lot of the games I used to excel at (I’m looking at you, Mario!) so I was not sure if I could button-mash fast enough to play such games. $25 or more is too much to spend on a game that is too hard for me to play. While I dithered about a purchase, I spent some time playing NES versions of the <em>Double Dragon</em> games and <em>River City Ransom</em>, but found those games are too primitive to be much fun for me anymore.</p>

<p>The Scott Pilgrim game was on sale for a stupidly low price ($7.49 or something), so I picked it up. To my surprise and delight, it is awesome. It has a colorful pixel art style that mimics the Scott Pilgrim comics. Its level design, character design, and animations show a lot of humor and attention to the source material. The chiptune soundtrack is really catchy. Play controls are easy to pick up. It starts out really hard, but you can replay levels to level up your character (i.e., lean new moves), and earn money to upgrade your character’s stats (strength, defense, etc.), which makes the game easier. It is kind of grind-y, at least for a conservative, low-skilled player like me, but the grind is fun.</p>

<p>Basically, everything about the video game does justice to the source material. Playing it caused me to want to reread the graphic novels, which I started to do yesterday. <em>Scott Pilgrim</em>, in comics form, is weird, surreal, and a real mess—you know, a perfect reflection of the early twenties and late teens lives of its characters. The characters, plot, and themes of the book, are complex, messy, flawed, and not fully formed. Nobody is a role model. Nobody is mature. Reality itself is warped for them. It makes no sense that Scott goes into video game mode and <em>kills</em> his girlfriend’s exes. Is that a metaphor? Only kind of. You’re just not expected to take it seriously. It’s <em>all</em> problematic—like life, I guess. I don’t really think it is deep (maybe you would if you were much younger than me), but it is really good at stirring up complicated thoughts and emotions in me about how messy life is. During this re-read, I have thought about how I might judge people who haven’t figured their lives out yet, or overlook the good qualities in someone like that. My feelings about those things are different now than they were when I first read the series about ten years ago.</p>

<p>I also watched a couple clips of the <em>Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World</em> movie on YouTube, too, and am trying to find a new respect for it. I saw the movie only once, after I had read all the graphic novels, and absolutely<em>hated</em> it because my favorite parts of the graphic novels—the ones involving character growth—are mostly not depicted in the movie. It does have a stunning <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446029/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm">cast</a>, though; it’s unbelievable that all those young actors who became so big later on are in the same movie.</p>

Since late last week (and for hours last night) I have drafting a white paper that covers a topic at work that I am an expert in—that’s going to be a rather long project. I was just drafted into a presentation team on Friday, and I spent last evening brainstorming and I spent this evening writing an 800-word outline for it. I am teeming with ideas all of a sudden.

         	<p>I characterize the mindset of American conservatives—specifically the ones who are blasé or antipathetic toward anti-COVID measures such as vaccines and face-masks—thusly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bad things happen to other people. That is, until they happen to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oddly enough, that is also my progressive-but-not-lunatic-fringe-liberal mindset. I figure that it is more healthy to assume I will <em>probably</em> be all right, given the precautions I take, rather than to expect the worst and be anxious about it all the time. (I’ve already done that about COVID for a solid year or more.) I prepare for the worst, so that I can protect myself and my family as best I can, but I <em>assume</em> the worst won’t happen to me.</p>

<p>I admit that new information, such as learning that breakthrough infections are a thing and that the are new COVID cases in my daughter’s school and my wife’s school every day or so, shakes this mindset quite a bit sometimes. COVID is like a specter that is constantly moving closer.</p>

<p>Based on the COVID-related stress I am still dealing with on a daily basis, this healthy-when-I-apply-it attitude is all I have to keep me going. I <em>know</em> I am whistling past the graveyard. I know the Angel of Death will not pass over my house forever. I know I am waiting for the other shoe to drop. But for now, the thought that “bad things happen to other people” is getting me from mini-crisis to mini-crisis without completely losing my mind.</p>

I am writing a white paper based on the presentation I wrote earlier this year, with the goal to publish it—or articles based on it—in an industry journal. It’s about how to do a certain type of project that I specialize in at work. That’s a topic I know a lot about, but have lacked the confidence to understand that it really is something valuable. By communicating my ideas to others in my presentation, I have realized that I really am knowledgeable about the area I work in, and that I have valuable ideas that I can share.</p>

<p>I am writing and editing somewhat furiously now (for me—I’m not an author) on my Mac and on my iPhone (thanks, Ulysses). I can’t stop. It is great to feel excited about and energized by a writing project again. I credit my daily writing habit on my blog for giving me the confidence to tackle a bigger writing project again. Writing something like this is no sweat for me. After all, I write for publication every day.</p>

         	<p>Viewing this <a href="https://youtu.be/cVLpdzhcU0g">wonderful lecture on the importance of a classical education</a> made me wonder if I had, or did not have, a classical education. I read a lot of great works, struggled a lot with deep reading, philosophy, and trying to understand the human condition, but I have many, many gaps in my reading and education, too. Reading <em>Ulysses</em> for the first time lately has truly impressed these shortcomings on me. I miss many allusions to classic and Christian thought, not to mention Irish history and geography.</p>

Earlier this year, I made a decision to return to reading classic literature almost exclusively—even at a snail’s pace, and even if I struggle to understand it—to improve both my education and my outlook on life. I think it has been a worthwhile journey thus far, but I have far, far to go. It is a journey that ends only when I do.</p>

I am tired of hearing that some people are disappointed that they are only incremental improvements on the previous models, or that Apple isn’t exciting anymore.

<p>The steady ratchet of incremental improvement is one of humankind’s greatest achievements. The entire modern world is built on it. It’s how you get from good to great. Complaining about it is nonsensical.</p>

         	<p>According to the superintendent of schools, some parents in my town are sending their children to school wearing “fake” masks that superficially satisfy mask wearing requirements while being completely ineffectual. These masks do not protect the wearer or anybody else from COVID or any other type of disease. They are specifically designed to be as flimsy as possible; some are even see-through. It’s a product for people who want to be assholes, pretend that COVID is not real, and thumb their noses at responsible people.

         	<p>My daughter has been in school three days so far this school year. Every school day, our entire community has received an email from the superintendent of schools stating that there are new COVID cases affecting students and staff at all, or almost all, of the schools in the district.</p>

<p>This is from today’s email:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As stated previously, I realize that our school community has varying viewpoints on COVID-19 and specifically on mask protocols. We are going to continue to make decisions in the best interest of safety for our students and staff. <em>In only three days of school</em>, we already have had 21 positive student cases and 10 positive staff cases. It is essential that we stay vigilant and monitor for signs and symptoms of COVID-19.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I live in a mid-sized town, and each school is pretty small, and most of the elementary schools have no air conditioning. The kids are being allowed to take off masks for “excessive heat” reasons, due to a loophole in our governor’s COVID masking mandate and due to incredible pressure by a vocal faction of parents. My wife and I believe this attitude about masks is cavalier and dangerous. We hate the idea of sending our daughter into this environment with a vaccine, and also hate the idea of pulling her out of more school because being away so long already has not been good for her mental health. All of us are frustrated and exhausted by all of this, and there does not seem to be an end to the pandemic in sight.</p>

When I do, it’s usually “good” TV that I have to pay attention to. I no longer have mindless TV shows that are good to kind-of pay attention to while folding laundry. When I was younger and lived alone, I always had sitcoms and sports on that I didn’t really care about, but were good distractions while I was puttering with something or doing light choses.

         	<p>On Saturday, my nine-year-old daughter hosted a pasta party for the family that she had been planning for weeks. She created invitations that listed a schedule full of activities. She also created a menu of four different types of pasta (spaghetti, ziti, farfalle, and elbows), homemade meatballs, homemade bread, and for dessert, chocolate pudding and homemade shortbread. My wife, my mother-in-law, and I cooked. During the party, my daughter led us through telescope painting and decorating (the telescopes were paper towel rolls) and a pasta parade (we walked around the block while my kids held toy pots). After dinner, she gave each of us a goodie bag containing a thank you note and a ten-page short story that she wrote about making a new friend. She worked so hard on everything, it brought tears to my eyes. I am very proud of her.</p>

         	<p>I got my first job when I was sixteen. I was a dishwasher at a restaurant for about half of summer. Soon after I started, my mom wanted me to tell my grandfather about my new job. She was proud of me for getting a job, even though it was a job with low status and poor pay. My grandfather had worked as a short order cook and a baker for most of his life, so he was well-versed in working in a kitchen.</p>

<p>When I told him about the dishwashing job, what he said back to me was really strange. He said, “That’s great. Washing dishes is a good skill to know in case society collapses and machines won’t work anymore.” It was out of character for him to say something so cynical, and it pretty much stopped the conversation in its tracks.</p>

<p>Now it is over 25 years later, and I wonder, as I listen to podcasts dissecting news, technology, and podcasts as I wash dishes in my house four times a day: Is society going to collapse? Is climate change the thing that does us all in? Are we, as a species, extinguishing all of the natural resources we need to survive? How long is it going to take for things to start falling apart because of it? Maybe not as long as I would like it to be.</p>

<p>If that is how society collapses, perhaps machines will be the only things left that will be able to wash dishes. In that case, my dishwashing skills will not be useful after all.</p>

         	<p>I have just started to use my new Planck keyboard for work for a short, short time each day. It has been rough going so far. I expected to have trouble typing in Colemak-DH because I just started learning that layout. I did not expect to have as much trouble with chording keyboard shortcuts. The problems I am facing are making me doubt whether I really can use a 40% keyboard for work, where it would give me the most benefit.</p>

<p>On my Mac, this is almost never an issue. In general, Mac keyboard shortcuts are easier to enter, and are friendlier to laptop-style keyboards that lack certain control keys.</p>

<p>Conversely, Windows apps like Excel make heavy use of function keys (F1-F12) and operator keys (-, +, *), which, on the Planck, live on a secondary layer that requires a key held down to access. When a Windows shortcut requires a function or operator key plus a modifier key (typically Shift, Alt, or Control, or a combination of them), I find it very challenging to enter it. There are just too many keys to hold down and it gets very awkward.</p>

<p>In Excel, I especially miss a key I never even used until last year: the menu key. I must find a suitable mapping for it, because I have come to rely on it for all sorts of things, primarily special forms of pasting. Furthermore, my Windows file manager of choice, FAR Manager, assigns important functions to keys my keyboard does not even have, like Insert, Right Shift, and Right Control, and makes extensive use of Shift+Function keys for common operations such as renaming a file.</p>

<p>I am slowly figuring out how to map some of the complex key command chords I use to single keys on another layer. That may be the answer for some things, but it doesn’t scale well. I may have to adjust what software I use and how I do certain things.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>One challenge with the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck">Planck</a> that I did not anticipate is that I have trouble hitting the (little) left shift key, and I miss having a right shift key (the Planck has none). It is especially surprising to me because I rarely used the right shift key before I made it a goal last year to use right-shift all the time, rather than stretch my left pinky crazy distances. I think one reason left-shift is more difficult to hit is that the Colemak-DH layout keeps my fingers on the home row all the time. When I type QWERTY, my hands fly all around the keyboard like a concert pianist’s, so it feels more normal to shift my entire left hand to press the shift key.</p>

<p>To mitigate my shift problem, I enabled the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/oryx-planck">AutoShift</a> feature of my keyboard’s firmware. If I press and hold a letter key—which feels a bit like a firm press rather than a ling press—a capital letter is produced. It is a really smart feature, but I am still getting used to it, and it interrupts my flow.</p>

         	<p>I have been typing more and more each day with the Colemak-DH layout on my new <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck">Planck</a> keyboard. I basically know where all the keys are, but my typing is laborious and slow. I have to think very hard to type every word. At my best right now, I make a plan for the word I will type next, then try to execute that plan without making too many errors. At worst, I look down at the keyboard and hunt and peck.</p>

<p>I remember when learning QWERTY that, after learning where all the letters were, I started to memorize certain patterns to type particular words or parts of words. In other words, I <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com/advice/psychologists/what-is-chunking-psychology-definition-and-applications/">chunked</a> it. Typing fast was a matter of stringing along series of predefined multi-key movements which acted like mental macros.</p>

<p>I see myself at the very beginning of the chunking process right now. It will take a lot more practice to get fast, but I plan to stick with it; hopefully it will be worth it in the long run. If I can type more efficiently I believe I will incur less RSI going forward. That is my main goal in switching keyboards and layouts.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>When I was in business school, back in the early aughts, I did a team presentation project on the topic of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_pay_gap">male/female wage gap</a>. To this day, I am embarrassed at my work on this project. I was young, hard-working, and idealistic, but I was unknowingly naive to the world and think I got it all wrong.</p>

<p>At the time, I worked at an insurance company, and there was a huge number of women in the departments I worked with at manager and director levels. I was just starting out in my career, so I was lower in rank than almost every woman I worked with, too. That may have clouded my thinking a bit, because I lacked the perspective of someone who worked in a more exclusively male-dominated work culture. I didn’t see how women were treated at other workplaces.</p>

<p>To prepare for our project, which was a group presentation, I did a lot of reading on the wage gap issue. It didn’t make sense to me that it could exist. I could understand if compensation amounts averaged out with a gap between male and female average wages, but I thought there had to be a sensible reason for that. It must come down to things like the type of job taken, the number of hours worked per week, the number of overtime hours worked, employee performance, and on asking for a higher salary when applying for a job. The literature I read on the subject supported that, conditionally, but was noncommittal about whether a wage gap really existed, and about what the average male and female wage numbers actually reflected.</p>

<p>My main logical argument against the wage gap actually meaning that there was a male/female bias in the workplace, was that if women made less money for a particular job than men, I, as a rational employer, would predominantly hire women for that job, to save money on labor. That isn’t happening; therefore, the gender pay gap did not really exist. My project team was mostly young corporate women. They agreed with me. We didn’t even really argue about it, though I remember acting a little embarrassed about the conclusion I had come to when I presented it to them. We presented on the topic based on my conclusion, and otherwise had a successful, if uneventful, presentation to our class.</p>

<p>The problem is, my idea of rational hiring decisions does not reflect how the world works. People make hiring decisions—and all kinds of other decisions—for reasons that don’t make rational sense at all. At the heart of these decisions are preferences, and preferences are largely affected by bias. Bias is, essentially, a preference that can’t be adequately explained. Put another way, bias just doesn’t make sense. No sense can be made from it because it doesn’t depend on sense.</p>

<p>I came to this conclusion shortly after my team completed that project. I have thought a lot about it since. The thought of it pops into my head unexpectedly sometimes, like the memory of a time I sang the wrong line of a song in the high school musical, in front of everybody on closing night, and it crowds out memory of the rest of my performance, across all the performances, where I made no mistakes. It’s easy to dwell on the times you get things wrong, I suppose. At least in this case I learned something.</p>

<p>Now that I am older and have more experience with and exposure to the world, I notice that bias is everywhere. Bias is the sort of thought virus that nibbles away at logic and replaces it with something that feels more right or more comfortable to the thinker or decider. You do not choose to be biased; if anything, bias, soaked up from the society around them, chooses you.</p>

<p>Since I made that business school presentation years ago, my conclusion on the topic has completely reversed. Bias must affect hiring decisions and wages to the detriment of traditionally underserved or discriminated against groups of people, including women, <em>because it affects everything else</em>. Moreover, you can’t go looking for it with logic, because bias is inherently illogical.</p>

In general, the Harold Blooms of the world lost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Western_Canon">that argument</a>. <a href="https://www.aarp.org/entertainment/books/info-06-2013/books-to-read-this-summer.html">High school reading lists today</a> are far more diverse and are—as my high school English teachers feared—diluted in quality. The classics have been pared back, to make way for new ideas and more diverse voices.</p>

<p>Case in point: my wife is teaching <em>The Hunger Games</em> to high school juniors this school year. I have read <em>The Hunger Games</em> and could probably craft a few lessons based on its material, but I don’t think of it as literature; it’s a fun Y.A. beach read devoid of subtext. The dilution in quality is not a function of the increase in diversity. It’s a function of trying to hold kids’ attention.</p>

<p>I think it must be possible to make classic literature interesting and relevant to high school students. That said, it is a challenge I do not face.</p>

         	<p>After getting very upset at our daughter’s elementary school’s plan for lax COVID safety protocols announced during a webinar last night, she woke up at 4 AM this morning and wrote impassioned emails to the superintendent of schools, the school board, and the principal. She emailed and talked to other teachers at the school, our rabbi, our pediatrician, and her doctor friend to ask for advice. She and I seriously talked about disenrolling our daughter and home schooling her. After a lot of thought, though, we decided that we have to accept more risk than we are really comfortable with, for the sake of our daughter’s mental health. It was a stressful day, and we did not get what we wanted, but I am proud of all the effort that my wife put in to try to push for something better.</p>

<p>As for me, my main contributions today were cogent conversation and homemade chicken noodle soup, fresh baked bread, and salad.</p>

         	<p>My daughter’s elementary school will not require masks if the outside temperature is 75°F or over.

In general, the COVID measures are based on outdated conjectures about how the disease is spread, and will be ineffective against an airborne pathogen. My wife wants to pull our daughter out of school. I’m not sure what the right call is, because I’m not sure how to quantify the risk or be sure about what would be equitable for my daughter.</p>

         	<p>When I was in college, I longed not to be learned but to be <em>wise</em>. I was learning rapidly, and soaking up new ideas all the time. I was making connections between all sorts of different systems of thought and culture. I thought I had human nature all figured out.</p>

<p>I was, however, wise enough at the time to know that I would be foolish to consider myself wise. That paradox never really resolves itself. The moment you think yourself wise, you have made a fool of yourself. Go ahead…try it, then wait a while.</p>

<p>Still, I must have shot my mouth off about how wise I was, because some people thought I <em>was</em> wise, and would ask me to help them sort out problems in their personal or academic lives. I was foolish enough back then to try to help them.</p>

<p>Now that I am middle-aged and raising two children with my wife, I feel both smarter and more foolish than ever. It is hard to feel wise when you can’t get your kids to do the simplest things most of the time. I find people–even the ones I am closest to–to be, at turns, more predictable and more inscrutable than ever. It is much easier to predict what people will do than it is to understand why.</p>

<p>What does it really mean to be wise? It’s certainly different than being smart, clever, or quick–though all those things don’t hurt. Being wise is about seeing the big picture, especially when those around you have lost sight of it, and using that viewpoint to help others help themselves.</p>

         	<p>I can write. I always could.</p>

<p>In high school, I wrote cogently and forcefully, like someone who read the up-Ed pages of two newspapers every day. Unlike most of my peers I had figured out how to revise and shape text—how to edit out hedging and weasel words and unfinished thoughts. Essay structure and organization fascinated me.</p>

<p>In college I wrote passionately with explosive figurative language. I wrote and put on a play: a farce poking fun a dorm life at my school. My seniors honors theses had jokes in them and won awards. My prose was called “airtight” in creative writing class.</p>

<p>As a young adult, I thought I might write professionally. I wrote four or five nights a week, at the local library, after work and dinner were done. I worked on short stories and screenplays that, sadly, didn’t end up going anywhere.</p>

<p>Writing was a lonely hobby for me. I had no community. I lived in the suburbs and didn’t think I could even find a writing community near me. I envied friends who lived in cities and could join writing classes or groups. The worst part of it was that I couldn’t figure out how to create interesting plots. I could write stories, but I had no stories to tell. I have no gift for plots—only for <em>telling</em>. Eventually I stopped writing entirely, in favor of business school and other things.</p>

<p>So, I can <em>write</em>. I have a <em>voice</em>. But I don’t have much to say. I never know what to write about. I lack <em>ideas</em>, which is frustrating when I have the ability (perhaps the gift) to shape and communicate them clearly.</p>

<p>Recently, I decided to write and publish…something, maybe something small, maybe a whole essay…every day, to force myself to think, write, revise, and publish even when the ideas don’t come. I think that the activity will help me get over whatever block or self-editing has been standing in the way of my writing endeavors for so long.</p>

         	<p>My caffeine experiment is almost at its end. For the past week, I have only drunk decaffeinated coffee. One funny thing I noticed is that decaf coffee is not nearly as disappointing when you are no longer addicted to caffeine.</p>

<p>My caffeine free (or almost free) lifestyle thus far has left me with no downsides: my energy level is just fine all day. I am not tired at all during work hours, and I no longer desperately crave an afternoon coffee each day. I do fall asleep earlier at night and more easily, which is a benefit. Instead of not being able to sleep until 2 A.M. most nights, I am ready to turn in by midnight, and sometimes even earlier, which puts me more in sync with my wife.</p>

<p>All in all, after a rocky start with three days of withdrawal symptoms, my experiment has been a success.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Today I started flashing custom layouts to my new <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck">Planck EZ keyboard</a>. It runs <a href="https://qmk.fm">QMK firmware</a>, but the manufacturer has tools call <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/oryx-planck">Oryx and Wally</a> that make customizing and flashing simple. On a software level, it is the best keyboard I have ever used. On a hardware level, it is solid, too, but I am not used to the ortholinear layout yet or the layers system. Typing with my left hand, especially the letters C and X, is a little problematic for me, because the Planck requires the use of different fingers than what I use for those keys on staggered layouts. Also, I my fingers tend to land in between the keys sometimes when I have to stretch my index finger or pinkie to reach a key.</p>

<p>I have been taking <a href="https://mattgemmell.com/the-planck-keyboard/">Matt Gemmel’s blog posts about the Planck</a> as an inspiration for customizing it. Following his example, I created a numpad layout today, which will come in handy for work. I also turned on automatic capitalization, which capitalizes letters if you hold them down a tiny bit longer than a normal keypress. It is a cool feature, and may be more important for ergonomics than the layer system is for me.</p>

<p>I have also been practicing the Colemak layout on <a href="https://www.keybr.com/">Keybr.com</a>. Strangely, I could not get the web app to understand my keyboard layout unless it is in QWERTY mode; I have to emulate Colemak in the app, which is kind of a mixed blessing for now, when I could not even log into my computer in the Colemak layout.</p>

<p>All in all, it is fun to try something new. I wonder if I can actually learn the Colemak layout well enough to use it full time.</p>

         	<p>I always used to dread meeting new people. They always asked “what do you do?” And what I do (for work, naturally) has mostly been nebulous and boring and unglamorous.</p>

<p>When I worked in corporate systems, I was too young to be an interesting (read: rich) tech nerd. When I worked in management consulting, no one really knew what that meant, and neither did I. When I worked in internal audit, no one wanted to hear about it. (Let’s just say people like to complain about auditors.)</p>

<p>For much of my career I’ve had the same kind of job: an ill-defined amalgam of consultant, auditor, and regulatory examiner. When I met someone new, we would be inevitably get into conversations like this:</p>

<p>“Do you work in insurance?”</p>

<p>“No; not really.”</p>

<p>“Do you work in audit?”</p>

<p>“No; not really.”</p>

<p>“Do you work for the state?”</p>

<p>“No; not really.”</p>

<p>You would basically need a weeklong seminar in an absurdly dull hotel conference center to understand what we do at my company and why it is important. It is technical. It is dull. It involves financial solvency (yawn). It involves close reading of legislation that even the legislators probably don’t understand.</p>

<p>Recently, I figured out a better way to express what I do: I help regulators make sure insurance companies are doing what they are supposed to do. That simple, vague explanation seems to be the best one I have come up with yet. Insurance may be dull, but it has the benefit of being, well, hated by a lot of people. Everyone wants to make sure insurance companies they are customers of do what they are supposed to do.</p>

<p>I think the best answer to “what do you do?” is always “I help people.” Because if you don’t help people, then what purpose is there to anything you do.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have started to learn the Colemak keyboard layout on my new ortholinear keyboard. Colemak is a modern keyboard layout designed to reduce finger travel (and overall hand movement around the keyboard), while preserving the position of some keys that are vital for chording with the Command or Control keys: C, V, X, and Z.</p>

<p>It has been brutally slow going. I have been a touch typer on normal, staggered QWERTY keyboards for over 30 years. I taught myself touch typing on my mom’s electric typewriter from audio tapes she borrowed for me from the library. Those tapes dated from the World War II. They were Army training tapes, and their oft shouted message was that good typing skills would help defeat the Nazis, which was a pretty crazy idea to me as a child in the early 1990s. When I was in high school, I took up guitar and played all the time. As an unexpected side effect, my typing speed increased dramatically, thanks to increased dexterity honed in guitar practice.</p>

<p>My typing speed probably peaked in college at about 100 words per minute. It has slowly diminished since, due to repetitive stress injury, acute injuries to my hands and forearms, and generally bad genetic luck when it comes to wrists. I believe my typing speed now ranges between 40 and 75 WPM, at about 95% accuracy. That is certainly good enough for me, most of the time. What isn’t is that sometimes typing <em>hurts</em>, and often when that is the case, I don’t have the luxury to stop, because I have to type for work.</p>

<p>Right now, on my new keyboard, with Colemak layout, my typing speed is about 8 WPM, and that’s with only five letters in the mix! It is interesting to be tackling something I am this bad at. I feel the struggle as I practice typing. Even when I know the correct key to push, I end up pushing the wrong one (the QWERTY one) sometimes. YouTube videos on the subject have taught me to focus on accuracy rather than on speed, so that us what I am doing thus far. I plan to practice daily for a while before changing my layout permanently.</p>

<p>I typically argue that one should further develop strengths rather than try to eliminate weaknesses. It is far better to be great at a particular thing than to be average at a ton of things. At this task, though, my goal is to be average rather than a typing speed demon, just not in pain while doing it. I have been a good typer, and probably could be again if it weren’t so painful to type blazing fast for more than a new minutes at a time.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In college, I studied literature. What I learned about literature is that history, religion, and general knowledge are all wrapped up in narrative. So are our memories. We are the story we tell ourselves, as individuals, as nations, as peoples. Narrative <em>is</em> memory, and sometimes the narrator is an untrustworthy one.</p>

<p>I learned a lot about literature there, but I missed the important lesson: Why do we study literature? To learn <em>empathy</em>.</p>

<p>Lack of empathy is a fundamental problem in our society. Blame social media. Blame political polarization. Blame whatever you want. You could argue that society fractured in large part because we no longer share a common literature. We don’t read the foundational texts that, in part, make up our culture. We don’t read the foundational texts that make up other cultures—which may just help us understand other people. In school, whatever books we do read, that are “taught” to us, are dissected and analyzed, but not often enough put back together again and connected to anything real.</p>

<p>I think literature should be taught <em>to</em> teach empathy to students. Students should be told that is what it is for, and stories should be compared to real life events—not just personal experience, which is limited—as much as possible. We should think about making connections to ourselves and others, not just about connections between texts and ourselves.</p>

I had only one student, the son of a very nice teacher at my high school. After school in the drafting classroom, my student and I would listen to music he liked and try to transcribe it and learn how to play it.</p>

<p>Several times he asked me a question as we puzzled through a guitar solo: “There’s no way I’m ever going to be as good as Jimmi Hendrix, so why should I even bother playing at all?” I answered: “It doesn’t matter if it’s good. It matters that it’s yours. It matters that you did it, and it reflect what you as a person were feeling at the time.”</p>

<p>Maybe you can’t be as good at guitar as Jimmi Hendrix was, but you can be your best self at whatever you put yourself to: poetry, songwriting, fiction, musicianship, business, charity. The list goes on.</p>

         	<p>To err is human. To forgive, divine. But to have a good chance to detect and correct mistakes, you need controls. That’s what I have learned in my audit career.</p>

<p>A control helps you understand if a transaction or business process completed completely, correctly, and timely. It is designed to answer the auditor’s most probing question: “How do you know?”</p>

<p>The term itself is jargon, and isn’t widely understood outside of accounting, finance, audit, and compliance circles—unless you are pulled into an audit of some kind as a subject matter expert. One of my bosses used to say all the time, as a joking impersonation of management, “What is a control?” (It would be silly to say that joke <em>killed</em>, but we all got it.)</p>

<p>Of course “control” has a slightly different meaning in everyday language. I think most people want control over their lives: freedom, autonomy, and independence; and also, somewhat paradoxically, stability and predictability. As societal norms and expectations shift, and political, environmental and economic pressures escalate, the present feels more and more uncertain over time—it is literally out of control. As a counterweight to that, a lot of people long for strong leaders who promise to exert control by force of will, or just by force—in other words, authoritarian control.</p>

<p>The problem is that all leaders, both good and bad, know that it is easier to assert that things are correct rather than to actually correct them. In the business world, the same kind of situation applies. An executive can say that a company is doing everything it can in certain areas, but without controls and transparency, there is no way to know if such a statement is true.</p>

<p>On an individual basis, we can’t control everything that happens in our lives. What we can do, however, on an everyday personal level, is to implement the controls (in the audit sense) over what we do and the decisions we make. These can be gaurdrails and double-checks as simple as The Golden Rule and Measure Twice, Cut Once. Just ask yourself sometimes: How do you know if what you’re doing is right?</p>

         	<p>After over twenty years as a coffee drinker, I am now the owner of a drip coffee maker for the first time. <a href="https://www.mrcoffee.com/coffee-makers/view-all/mr.-coffee-5-cup-programmable-coffee-maker-25-oz.-mini-brew-brew-now-or-later-with-water-filtration-and-nylon/SAP_2132049.html">Its make and model</a> are nothing special, and it doesn’t actually brew better coffee than my <a href="https://aeropress.com">AeroPress</a> or French Press or <a href="https://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com">Chemex</a> ever did. In fact, the coffee it produces (with far less manual effort) is actually a little worse. Strangely enough, that is the whole point. I want coffee to be less enticing to me, because I am trying to wean myself off caffeine and maybe even cut coffee out of my diet entirely.</p>

<p>I think my (modest) coffee habit is causing me some health problems, and I finally came to a mindset where it seemed possible to do something about it. So far, in the few weeks since I drastically reduced my daily caffeine intake, I have noticed digestive benefits, which I expected, and also, unexpectedly, a decrease in day-to-day anxiety—which is something I didn’t even know I had until it was gone. Up until this week I worried about removing something pleasurable from my daily routine, but I am finding that there is something pleasurable in being even keeled, and, of course, in not being dependent on a drug, albeit a socially acceptable one.</p>

         	<p>Last night I told my wife I was going to go entirely to decaffeinated coffee starting today. After one look from her, I chickened out, and revised my goal to “quarter decaf”: half decaf in the morning, and full decaf in the afternoon. I still plan to eliminate (almost all) caffeine from my diet, but I am not sure if I will just drink decaf coffee twice a day, to preserve my warm beverage habit, or if I will forego coffee altogether. The latter would probably simplify my life a little bit, and is attractive, but I might go crazy drinking only water day and night.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Today I, along with a small team, gave the biggest presentation I’ve done in years: a webinar for my company’s clients. We did an outstanding job. Now that it is over, I feel relieved and exhausted.</p>

<p>I spent several months earlier this year gearing up for this day. I decided early on to level up my presentation skills, which I thought were already very good. I took the learning process very seriously. I watched hundreds of hours of video: other people’s presentations, TED talks, Apple keynotes, lectures on speaking and communication, and instructional videos about visual design, slide decks, and PowerPoint. I made prototype slide decks in which I tried different techniques, and also tried to make some of the new techniques I liked work with my company’s PowerPoint template. I threw out and revised every slide I created several times. I practiced the entire talk out loud and made revisions to the visuals and to my script to communicate my ideas more succinctly. In the revision process, the true message of my presentation became more clear, and I was able to focus more on that. Lastly, I wrote almost the entire talk down in the speaker notes, to preserve the best part of my presentation, even though I had nearly memorized the entire thing while working on it.</p>

<p>This is all probably normal stuff to professional presenters, but I’m not one of them. For the past ten years or so, I have typically presented only once or twice a year, and most of those presentations were to my coworkers (sometimes the whole company, but it’s a small company). Before this year, I didn’t rehearse my talks, and my slides, while uncluttered, were usually not visually interesting. Now, after having put in so much hard work, I think I can present very well. I have gained confidence in myself for future presentations, and feel proud of myself for what I have achieved.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I read James Joyce’s classic short story collection, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubliners"><em>Dubliners</em></a>, while I was on my vacation. I read it as part of my presswork for tackling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(novel)"><em>Ulysses</em></a>, which I am slowly navigating now.</p>

<p>I don’t normally enjoy short stories because they usually seem incomplete—cut off just before they got interesting. Short story collections are usually disjointed; I prefer collections that have common characters or plot threads that run through all the stories. I have been reading more this year than in the past, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Kitteridge"><em>Olive Kitteridge</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive,_Again"><em>Olive, Again</em></a> which I enjoyed very much. (They are called “novels,” but are in fact short story collections.)</p>

<p>The stories in <em>Dubliners</em>, of course, compose one of the archetypical collections of short stories. They are famous for the epiphanies that characters arrive at toward the end of each tale, and are devastating for the reader because those characters who recognize their personal failings or their poor lot end up doing nothing to fix things. Over and over again throughout the collection, his characters live rigid, bleak, repetitive lives, and choose comfort—and not even much comfort at all—and certainly over fulfillment and uncertainty.</p>

<p>I see the same themes in my own life. Everyone I know, including and especially myself—lives inside a rigid, repetitive routine: school, work, cooking, cleaning, a little leisure, maybe a vacation once or twice a year. Furthermore, I know that I, like some of Joyce’s characters, have chosen comfort over fulfillment—at least in terms of my career choices, and in some respects in terms of vacation travel as well. If I had taken more risks, perhaps I would have more money or status, and I might have made more of an impact on the world. My life, however, is nowhere near as bleak as the Dubliners Joyce writes about. I have a great family, a great home, and have done some great things I can be proud of. But it is chilling to think how repetitive everyday life is, and how much drudgery it entails; like Joyce’s characters in <em>Dubliners</em> each of us is stuck in a loop.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Sometimes when I’m working, I want music playing, but I don’t really know what I want to listen to, and I don’t have the patience to think about it. In these situations, I have tried listening to classical music, jazz, and lo-fi (hip-hop/trip-hop, etc.). Over the past week, I gave <a href="https://endel.io">Endel</a> an honest try, too.</p>

<p>While I enjoy classical music in a live setting, I don’t like listening to it in my headphones. Its wide dynamic range makes it so that I can’t hear some sections of it, and other sections are too loud. That doesn’t work for me; I want something that is not too loud, but is completely audible, all the time.</p>

<p>Jazz (especially classic jazz) was what I listened to almost exclusively during my senior year of college. It got me through reading and writing hundreds and hundreds of pages of text. However, I find my engagement with jazz to be all over the map. I love some of it and I hate some of it, and the kind of jazz you can just have on, not listening to—smooth jazz, I suppose—is just bad. All in all, I find jazz too distracting to listen to while I work, unless I listen to a single album that I already know and love.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music#2000s%E2%80%93present:_Hypnagogic_pop_and_chillwave">Lo-fi hip hop</a> is my favorite background music at this point. I appreciate its nearly constant beat, somewhat consistent tempos, and there appears to be a never-ending supply of it. My wife hates when I play it in the house when I am doing chores or writing, though, which means I can only really listen to it via headphones when I’m around her. It works great on my headphones while I read on my iPad, or through my loudspeakers when I work.</p>

<p>Over the past two weeks, I tried to get into Endel, which offers an AI-based soundscape that constantly changes and continually evolves as you listen to it. I like the idea a lot more than the reality of it, though I think it has a lot to do with my tinnitus. Endel is extremely treble-heavy and bass-light (really, there is no bass at all), and only one of its scenarios, Focus, has a beat. I would not describe the sounds as shrill, but they aggravate my tinnitus instead of helping me ignore it. Last week, I listened to Endel exclusively through headphones (my B&amp;O H9s and my AirPods) while I did chores like the dishes and laundry. This morning, now that I am back at work, I tried listening to the Focus soundscape for a few hours through my loudspeakers. It drove my wife and both my kids absolutely bananas. Each of them yelled at me to stop playing it, even though it was not playing loudly, and they were on a different level of the house. After that experience, I think I will not be buying an Endel lifetime subscription.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I plan to listen to <a href="https://chilledcow.com">Lofi Girl</a> for much of my workday. That is the best bet for me, when I can’t make up my mind about music and need to focus on my work more than what I am listening to.</p>

         	<p>I have been lowering my caffeine intake over the past month or so. While I don’t drink <em>that</em> much coffee, but I think that my two (strong) cups per day allotment is causing me some minor health problems. I am at the point where trying to quit (or at least drastically lower) caffeine consumption seems like a reasonable approach to try to improve things. In retrospect, it is embarrassing how long it has taken me to even consider lower caffeine intake as a possibility.</p>

<p>It has not been easy. I am trying to step down my caffeine intake by substituting decaffeinated coffee for some of the normal (good) beans in my brew. That experiment failed a couple of times; the normal ebb and flow of work-related stress led to a couple of relapses, all for a mid-afternoon boost. I restarted it when I started my vacation. I think I have been drinking about 25-30% of the caffeine in had been consuming. After a day or so I legitimately went through withdrawal symptoms: chills, headaches, and depression. I am perfectly fine now, but, from what I have read about caffeine withdrawal, I can expect even worse symptoms when I drop from some caffeine to none. I plan to stay at half-decaf levels for the next week or more, to delay that pain to a more manageable time.</p>

<ol>
<li>My kids going to bed at 10:00 or 11:00 PM</li>
<li>My RSI to make typing in the MacBook quite painful (at home I use an external keyboard exclusively these days)</li>
<li>Me taking up reading through the prose of James Joyce (I recently started <em>Ulysses</em>, after reading <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em> and <em>Dubliners</em>) and all sorts of related background material</li>
</ol>

<p>I am OK with this. I am resting and recuperating. I am also studying James Joyce fairly seriously late at night, which is something I would not have attempted during non-vacation time. I don’t have to churn out essays and source code to be productive.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>One frequent and inescapable sight on the rural roads of New Hampshire is the Trump campaign sign. In every town, there are Trump campaign signs flanking the ends of driveways. Huge Trump/Pence billboards are proudly hoisted over the signs for legitimate businesses, presumably by the owners themselves. Trump flags—and the occasional anti-Biden flag—hang limply from the front of houses; some of them are accompanied by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again">MAGA</a> battle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lives_Matter#/media/File:Thin_Blue_Line_Flag_(United_States).svg">flag</a>: the black-and-blue parody of the Stars and Stripes. This is unusual. Trump lost almost a year ago. In every other election I have lived through, all the campaign signs came down in short order. But in 2021, in every town I drive through, I pass by monument after monument to the loser.</p>

<p>Celebrating a win for too long is gauche and sad. Mourning a loss, however old, is noble. This is especially true when that loss neatly dovetails into an even greater loss that the MAGA movement clearly draws its inspiration from: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy">The Lost Cause</a>. They both stem from the very same great lies: “this [thing I don’t like] isn’t fair” and “my humiliation is your humiliation.”</p>

<p>It is too soon to know if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie#Trump's_false_claim_of_a_stolen_election">The Big Lie</a> will have the weight and longevity of The Lost Cause. It seems likely, though, that The Big Lie will simply get folded into The Lost Cause, remembered as yet another indignity in a long line. In that way, it can last, essentially, forever.</p>

<p>Those Trump campaign signs can stay up forever, too, even after the former president runs again in 2024, retires from public life, or dies. I think that it would be a mistake to extend sympathy to the sore losers who leave them there, because what they believe—that they were cheated by a clean democratic election—undermines the American ideals of representative democracy, equal protection, and law and order.</p>

<p>The Big Lie is not going away, at least not anytime soon. It has embedded itself as the base of the Republican platform. You will see politicians run on it in 2022. The mid-term elections are going to be rough, and will merely set the table for the circus that will be the next presidential election season. We are in for a difficult couple of years ahead.</p>

<p>We went to the nearby <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile_Lake">Profile Lake</a> instead, and ate our lunch at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man_of_the_Mountain">Old Man of the Mountain</a> viewing area.

         	<p>Today I drove the family to a tiny park in northern New Hampshire that consisted of a picnic area, a waterfall, and a couple of short trails. We ate a picnic lunch when we got there and then explored the place. We enjoyed experiencing the roar and spray of the falls and had multiple great vantage points to view it from. It was a great time.</p>

         	<p>After a sunny, exciting day at the fair, today was overcast, cool, and low-key.
We took the kids to a playground (with a view of a mountain) and to the bookstore/toy store in nearby Littleton, New Hampshire. The kids had great fun, but we had to cut our visit to down short due to rain.</p>

<p>Ironically, for the warmest year on record, this has been the coldest stretch of days that I have ever been in the mountains. It is a welcome respite from the heat in New Jersey, but it feels like I have traveled back in time. Nighttimes feel crisp, like late August/early September when I was a child.</p>

<p>We plan to go to a lake or to a theme park soon, once the sun returns and the temperature rises.</p>

         	<p>My family and I very much enjoyed the North Haverhill fair today. We had perfect weather, and I lucked out with the fair food (my wife and I shared the best fried Oreos I have had in years). My kids loved seeing the animals (one thing we saw was a goat obstacle course contest) and enjoyed the rides. I find that I enjoy fairs—especially the agricultural aspects—a lot more as an adult than I ever did as a kid.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/07/30/a-portrait-of.html">📚 A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/07/30/a-portrait-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-07-30 09:04:55 -0400">Jul 30, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I read James Joyce’s <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em> this week. I approached it in nearly the same way I approached books that I studied in college when I was an English major: I read some background about the book and where it fit into the literary cannon. I read it closely, and re-read parts that didn’t quite make sense at first. Lastly, after I finished the book, I read essays about it to make sure I didn’t miss too much of its meaning.</p>

<p>Because I did this on vacation, for fun, I held myself to a far lower standard than I did as an undergraduate. I think I understood much of what Joyce was getting at in the book, though I will admit that some of the Irish politics stuff flew over my head because I was not familiar with it. I found it fascinating that Joyce made his hero, Stephen Dedalus (a fictionalized version of himself), both a brilliant and thoughtful young man <em>and</em> an anxious, neurotic, and occasionally hubristic stuffed shirt.</p>

<p>I suppose Joyce’s loss of faith was both freeing and incredibly troubling for him, because it pervades the entire novel. The amount of religiosity in the book was a bit overwhelming to me, and far afield of what I normally encounter in the fiction I read. The oppressive superimposition of catholicism over everything reflects the oppressive superimposition of Irish identify politics over everything, too. The two are inseparable in this book: intimately entwined, and one in the same. Joyce left both behind in his real life, and as the book ends, Joyce’s stand-in, Dedalus does too.</p>

<p>Joyce’s Dublin-centered body of work, written while in self-imposed exile, leads me to believe that it impossible to cleave off certain aspects of yourself that developed you, even if you have learned to reject them and have come to resent them. Leave your home, go where you want to: you can never escape who you are.</p>

         	<p>Procrastination is just a fancy word for avoidance.</p>

<p>Socially, it is acceptable to procrastinate. After all, everyone does it sometimes. This makes it easy to not even think about <em>why</em> you are procrastinating.</p>

<p>Conversely, it is not normally acceptable to <em>avoid</em> something or someone. It smacks of cowardice, and almost no one wants to be considered a coward.</p>

<p>Think about that when you know you are procrastinating on certain tasks. Ask yourself: What am I avoiding? What am I afraid of?</p>

I use three iOS devices each day, and Reeder was showing me stale content on all of them at various points each day. I suppose local device syncing of 75 feeds was a bit too much for it to handle quickly and smoothly. I moved my RSS subscriptions back to Feedly and am once again satisfied with multi-device support.

         	<p>It’s a uniquely American thing, I have read, to work while on vacation. I have had to, as recently as last year. Some of my coworkers were reading, reviewing, and revising work papers and memos while on vacation last week. My vacation this year hasn’t technically started yet, but I am now in my family’s summer-vacation spot, my in-law’s lake house, primed to report in for remote work in the morning.</p>

<p>Next week, for me, is <em>planned</em> full-time, remote work, while on vacation with my family. I hope to have no <em>unplanned</em> work time after next week, when my vacation-proper finally begins. That kind of thing has happened in the past, and it could happen again this year.</p>

<p>I feel guilty each year for taking off two weeks with my family and finagling a weeks’ worth of remote work to tack onto it. It seems near impossible and nigh immoral to take off such an extravagant length of time from work. The idea is coming entirely from my own head at this point; no one explicitly tells me I’m doing something wrong, but it certainly feels like I am. I also wonder if my vacations are taking away from my opportunities for promotions, raises, or bonuses. In the end, it is more important to me to spend vacation time with my family, even though it feels like I am stealing that time from work.</p>

He asks why some people believe the “Big Lie” that Donald Trump really won the 2020 presidential election. His answer is an obvious but largely unspoken truth:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>…even the most modest amount of analysis and introspection will reveal that buying into the nonsense peddled by the former president and his clown college of cronies is not an aberration, not due to some momentary lapse on the part of the American electorate. We were raised on lies—including many lies that are much, much bigger than the big one that troubles us today.</p>

<p>Society asks us to believe all kinds of lies. We know this. We participate in it. And, with the exception of some period of adolescence when you figure out that the adult world is full of bullshit, we never rail against it or even really think about it. But we all know, in some ways, lies hold together all of human society. Don’t be surprised if people believe them.

         	<p>I am neither surprised or disappointed by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/22/apple-to-pill-idos-2-emulator-from-app-store/">Apple’s impending pull of “iDOS 2” from the App Store</a>. The whole point of buying Apple hardware has always been to buy into a unique ecosystem: the “walled garden.” While the Mac has never been locked down to Apple’s Mac App Store, the iPhone has always been locked down to its App Store. It’s easy to forget now, but the iPhone grew out of Apple’s prior consumer electronics smash hit, the iPod, which was was <em>completely</em> locked down. It didn’t have an App Store. Neither did the iPhone at first, either.</p>

<p>I hate to side with one of the world’s biggest companies here, but I totally believe that the iPhone is a console, as Steve Jobs described it. I knew that going into the iPhone ecosystem, and that’s actually what I wanted, and still want, from that ecosystem. I want an apps console that (for the most part) just works, and doesn’t require a lot of my time and effort to work smoothly and securely. I came at this from the other wide: an Android users who jailbroke and hacked his phone into something completely different than what its manufacturer and mobile data provider wanted or intended. The thing is, all that customization led to a system that was unstable, and I had no idea if it was secure at all, because the code (apps and OS) came from a bunch of different places. I just had to trust, blindly, that everything was OK. The iPhone imposed guardrails on my hacking activities—guardrails that I wanted, because what I was doing wasn’t working for me anymore.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people chafe at the idea that their most useful device is a <em>console</em> because we reserve that word for entertainment devices like the Nintendo Switch and the PlayStation, or the humble cable set-top box. It doesn’t matter, though, if the iPhone is more useful and more important than a video game system, though. What matters is how it is sold.</p>

<p>It isn’t exactly a secret that normal customers can only download iOS software from Apple’s App Store. Beyond hardware, access to that App Store is the fundamental thing being sold by Apple. Customers should know it when they are choosing a product. I doubt any of the complainers and hand-wringers commenting on this article on <em>MacRumors</em> didn’t know that going into their iPhone purchase.</p>

<p>I would love to run Windows games on my Nintendo Switch, but I can’t because it is a console and Nintendo does not allow it. That doesn’t surprise me, or anybody else for that matter. The situation is not really different than the one with the iPhone. If you want to run DOS on your mobile phone, the far-more-open Android universe is there for you—and it’s the most dominant OS platform in the world, too. Vote for it with your wallets and your time.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I like <a href="https://twitter.com/Indians/status/1418565355472101378?s=20">the new name of Cleveland’s Major League Baseball team</a>. I think the team’s old name, the “Indians,” and especially its already retired <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Wahoo">Chief Wahoo</a> logo, were problematic and absolutely needed to go. If you find the term “Indians” as applied to a ball club to be inoffensive, know that that merely means you are not among the ones who are offended by it. I am sure that, at best, a lot of negative stereotyping went into the choosing of that appellation.</p>

<p>I have heard that some Cleveland fans wanted to the team to go back to one of its old names, the “Spiders.” I think that would have been a mistake. Spiders may be fearsome, but they are not widely loved and are easily squished. (I find them icky, even though they are theoretically fascinating, but that’s just me.)</p>

<p>The best part of the “Cleveland Guardians” name, in my opinion, is its positivity. After all, to guard the city is noble and brave. It is, however, a generic word that concretely identifies nothing in particular, so it is understandable that some of their fans may be disappointed.</p>

<p>The team needs a memorable mascot and logo to make whatever a “guardian” is seem strong and cool. After all, what is a “guardian?” I have most often heard the word used in the phrase “parent or guardian” which is a lot less exciting than, say, “guardians of the galaxy.” (I have tremendous respect for people who are guardians—those who take care of, and look out for the best interests of, children. That really is heroic.)</p>

<p>While I like the name “Guardians,” I will admit it is not the <em>best</em> name for a baseball team. The best baseball team name is the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford_Yard_Goats">Hartford Yard Goats</a>, but that name was already taken.</p>

         	<p>Elizabeth Nelson wrote <a href="https://www.theringer.com/tv/2021/7/21/22585724/ted-lasso-character-study-season-2">the best, most accurate take on Ted Lasso</a> (the character) that I have ever read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unceasing optimism defines Ted Lasso. But roller-coaster mood storms, manic reveries, and seemingly deliberate head games also define Ted Lasso, the players’ coach, and make him one of the best and most-layered characters of the peak TV era. He’s a man who presents himself as two-dimensional, but who might actually be playing three-dimensional chess. We delight in his antics, marinate in his charm offensive, and celebrate his offbeat approach to winning the whole fucking thing. But at all times, there’s a slight worry, one that crops up in the back of our minds, about what he might be willing to do to make it happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People love the show’s positivity, but it also has a dark side that actually makes it good. There’s something just a little <em>off</em> about Ted Lasso, and that’s what makes him interesting.</p>

<p>While Ted wins over a bunch of potential enemies in England, his wife back in Iowa can’t stand his relentless positivity. Maybe you couldn’t either, if you were married to him.</p>

<p>Ted excels at darts because he spent every Sunday in a sports bar with his dad between the ages of ten and sixteen, when his father passed away. I don’t think it is normal to bring your underage son to a bar every single week. That isn’t exactly a normal childhood. Furthermore, losing a father at sixteen may have caused some emotional trauma that Ted buries deep, causing him to overcompensate with cheery paternalism in almost every interaction.</p>

<p>Most importantly, Ted fails. He failed at his marriage, he is trying and largely failing to be a good father, and he failed to produce a winning record for his team, or even keep them in the Premier League. As appealing as Ted is to the TV audience, what he is doing is not working—or not working yet—in the world of his story.</p>

<p>What made Season 1 great was the surprising complexity of what appeared to be a dumb, one-joke sitcom based on a commercial that hardly anybody remembered. Season 2 starts to air tomorrow. I hope the writers didn’t forget about the dark undercurrents that made their show about a nice guy work so well.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>If there is one thing I would like my kids to learn from me, it is that one of the greatest, most impactful human inventions of all time is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping">double-entry bookkeeping system</a> for accounting. If my son or daughter ever throws that term out in class when a teacher is writing a list of inventions on the board, there may be some “ums” and blank stares in the classroom, but I would be very proud.</p>

<p>Tim Harford reminds us of how important the double-entry system is, and of the system’s historical origin, in his essay “<a href="https://timharford.com/2021/07/the-tyranny-of-spreadsheets/">The Tyranny of Spreadsheets</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the late 1300s, the need for a solid system for accounts was evident in the outbursts of one man in particular, an Italian textile merchant named Francesco di Marco Datini. Poor Datini was surrounded by fools.</p>

<p>“You cannot see a crow in a bowlful of milk!” he berated one associate. “You could lose your way from your nose to your mouth!” he chided another.</p>

<p>Iris Origo’s vivid book The Merchant of Prato describes Datini’s everyday life and explains his problem: keeping track of everything in a complicated world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of us have always needed to keep track of everything. The knock-on effect of accountancy, going back to antiquity, is that someone wrote down what people owned and traded, what was abundant and what was rare, and even what came from where. Because of that, we have been able to learn the languages and numeric systems people wrote with, and what people valued, how they traded, and much more, in cultures that have long since passed away. It isn’t all because of the double-entry system in particular, but I think it is pretty interesting nonetheless.</p>

         	<p>When I was a kid writing essays for school, I always peppered my writing with big, fancy words in places that small, simple words would do. In part, I was showing off my big vocabulary to my teachers. For the most part, though, I was afraid to use the small, simple words because I thought of them as childish. I figured that small, simple words would make my writing seem small (as in insignificant) and simple (as in simplistic) as well. Of course, now I see that as folly. An argument that is simply stated is easier to understand, and thus more convincing, than one delivered in showy, but less comprehensible, language. While there are some glorious, complex words that I would never want to do without—<em>incarnadine</em>, <em>mellifluous</em>, <em>loquacious</em>, <em>raconteur</em>, <em>elixir</em>, *donnybrook*—I would never want an argument I write to hinge upon them.</p>

<p>Love is an emotion that does not meaningfully exist unless it is expressed through action. Actions are governed by choice. Thus, to act with love is a choice you have to make every day, many times a day. It doesn’t matter how you feel: love is what you <em>do</em>.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>It is popular now to lionize failure. Both fictional stories (thematically) and nonfictional accounts (explicitly) praise failure as a stepladder to greatness. It makes sense. Failure is a great teacher. It teaches us what does not work. It teaches us what we need to do better, and what we need to work harder on. It teaches us what our limitations are, and prods us into further developing our strengths.</p>

<p>While this is, in some way, timeless wisdom, the overt emphasis on it in the business book, personal productivity, and self-help space is relatively new. Our idols in business—wildly successful, and sometimes unimaginably wealthy, people—now regularly explain that they arrived at whatever monumental success they are famous for only after navigating a bumpy road potholed with failures all along the way. They tell stories about companies they started that went under, or products they developed that never found a market, or ideas they had that did not work with as much or more pride and excitement as when they talk about what actually did work for them. They talk about failure almost like it is success. They prod us to consider failure as the best learning opportunity—something to embrace rather than fear.</p>

<p>Well, sure, if you can handle it. For most people, it is a privilege to be able to fail. You have to be able to weather the storm. Not everyone can. It takes resources, like money and the right friends. It takes mental wherewithal, like good mental health (or, in some cases, psychopathy) provides. It takes opportunity, which for normal people often comes down to luck. Not everyone has those things. Not everyone who falls down can pick herself back up again. Sometimes a door closes and another one does not open up.</p>

<p>When serial entrepreneurs, angel investors, or CEOs wax on about their failures, be wary. Their discussion of past failures may be instructional, but it is also a showy way to appear humble. It disguises the privilege one often needs to survive failure without economic, emotional, or reputational humiliation.</p>

<p>Money and connections help some people fail upward. Their unsuccessful companies don’t liquidate; they get bought by other companies. They don’t go bankrupt when a business venture fails, but their employees lose their jobs and their investors take a hit. These exits are not failures; they are minor successes—at least for the owner or entrepreneur. The road to their success is not paved with failure. It actually is paved with minor success after minor success.</p>

<p>So don’t believe it when sometime tells you that experiencing failure is the only way to learn how to succeed. That simply is not true. Failure is a great teacher, but it is not the only teacher.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I think about education a lot, not only because I have kids, but also because my wife is a high school teacher, and I like to help her think up lessons. If I were a teacher, I would challenge my students to think really hard, to question what they have been told, and to go beyond the material and create new thoughts of their own based on what we discuss in class. My wife tells me that my level of instruction would suit some grad students, maybe, but not high school students, and presumably not undergrads either. That is dispiriting to me, but she would know better than I—she knows teens and young adults and intimately knows the educational system they are put through. Through her, I’m pretty aware that high school is not quite as I remembered it. Overall, it seems dumbed down compared to what I went through: loftier goals with lower expectations for achieving them.</p>

<p>I had figured that college was just the same as I remembered it—and thus would be very difficult for high school students to cope in, academically—but I am now not so sure about that. A few weeks ago, I read Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt’s <em>Atlantic</em> article “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/">The Coddling of the American Mind</a>.” It riled me up. I had seen Mr. Haidt sometime earlier discuss his thesis about the decline of thought on college campuses in favor of “safetyism” on <em>Real Time with Bill Maher</em>, and found it both compelling and dispiriting. I listened to one of his lectures on YouTube and thought about it quite for a while.</p>

<p>I went to Brandeis University—one of the schools mentioned in Lukianoff’s and Haidt’s article—in the 1990s. I remember that one of the main themes of my instruction there was that I should expect to be challenged and to confront new and potentially uncomfortable ideas. We, as a student body, we asked—explicitly—to learn about, discuss, and work through new ideas together. It wasn’t supposed to be easy. It was supposed to be difficult. Difficulty was the whole point. Open debate was how it worked. That was liberal arts scholarship—and I’m pretty sure college campuses were thought to be politically-correct, liberal romper rooms even then, so maybe even I got the watered-down version. Is the academic culture I came up in gone now, in favor of a focus on comfort and mollify action at the expense of debate and rigor?</p>

<p>Lately, I have wondered how it <em>really</em> is on college campuses. How much of this worry, put in me by some of the things I read and see, is about someone else’s hysteria about changing cultural and social norms? Are the stories about wokeness, safe spaces, trigger warnings, microaggressions, and call-out culture that I have seen on the Internet and in <em>The New York Times</em> the norm, or exceptions to the norm? What kind of story would make it all the way to me? Only the exceptional ones, I think. Maybe freedom of thought at college campus isn’t as constrained as I have been led to believe. I suppose I will find out when I explore this issue further, or years down the line when my kids are ready to look for the colleges they will attend.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have been having a lot of trouble finding books that excite me lately. Over the past month, I read through the first <a href="https://grishaverse.com">Grishaverse</a> novels trilogy (staring with <em>Shadow and Bone</em>) and found it only OK. (It could have been a single, much faster-moving novel, I think.) I started <em>Leviathan Wakes</em>, the first novel in <em>The Expanse</em> series, and couldn’t get into it. Most recently, I started <em>Black Sun</em> by Rebecca Roanhorse and, after reading a few chapters, concluded that it is not for me.</p>

<p>This blah feeling about well-regarded sci-fi and fantasy books surprises me. I used to love those genres. Now, when reading them, I find myself distracted by details that don’t make sense, like: <em>If the planet the story takes place on is much larger than Earth, then it would have much a stronger gravity field, and all life on it would have evolved differently (i.e., be sturdier and stronger), and humans wouldn’t be able to move as easily on its surface</em>. I can suspend my disbelief to quite a big extent to accommodate an alternate history, a magic system, or a populated exoplanet. However, for the story to be satisfying, the secondary effects of these fantastical elements have to make sense and properly serve (rather than work against) the story.</p>

<p>As a young adult—after earning my English degree, and until I had kids—I only read classics. Back then, I was looking for books I could get or borrow for free, and for novels that made me feel like I was continuing my studies in literature. I strayed from that path after a while, as my professional life became more technically-oriented (I read books about programming and systems design) and as I went through business school (I read about business, economics, sociology, and so on, to understand how the world worked). I started reading for escapism (mostly) and for learning (sometimes) several years back, but I am finding it hard to get interested in anything any more.</p>

<p>I think that means that I am now ready to go back to reading classics. To that end, I started James Joyce’s <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em> last night. I love it so far. It is formally challenging, full of ideas, and grounded in the real world. I know how to tackle difficult books, and plan, at this point, to read <em>Dubliners</em> after I finish <em>Portrait</em>. I’m looking forward to it.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I decided to upgrade my Windows laptop to Windows 11 yesterday. It was an awful slog, replete with many failed Windows Update attempts, permissions issues that prevented me from changing the necessary diagnostic data sharing settings, and even a hardware firmware update. I ended up having to “reset” Windows—which deleted all my apps, data, and settings—to move forward.</p>

<p>However, hours later, once Windows had finally gotten all of its updates in, I had the opportunity to use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/">Winget</a> for the first time. Winget is Microsoft’s command line package manager. Although not as mature as the package manager I am most familiar with, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)">APT</a>, Winget <em>is</em> pretty awesome. I was able to use it from the Windows CMD shell (because Windows Terminal does not come pre-installed) to install everything I needed, from Visual Studio Code to Vim to NextDNS. It saved me a ton of time. If I set up new Windows machines frequently, I could write a script to automate all of it.</p>

<p>It is interesting to see all the developer- and administrator-friendly enhancements Microsoft has made to Windows over the past few years. Windows Terminal, Winget, and Visual Studio Code are miles ahead of what Microsoft offered just a few years ago.</p>

         	<p>I enjoyed reading <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/too-smart/">Morgan Housel’s blog post</a> on the <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/about/">Collaborate Fund</a> blog. The ideas in the post are some that I want to explore in my blog, too. All these items are direct quotations from the post:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ability to create complex stories makes it easy to fool people, including yourself.</li>
<li>What’s boring is often important and the smartest people are the least interested in what’s boring.</li>
<li>Intelligence can make it difficult to communicate with ordinary people, who may have the missing insight you’re looking for.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are important ideas worth looking into and thinking about. An idea from another outside source—the <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/shows/make-me-smart-with-kai-and-molly/">Make Me Smart</a> podcast—came to mind when I read the post: “None of us is as smart as all of us.” (I just learned that the Internet attributes that quote to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/56863-none-of-us-is-as-smart-as-all-of-us">Kenneth H.

         	<p>I have been an Apple Music subscriber from the service’s very first day. I was an iTunes Match subscriber before that. I have been pulling an enormous electronic library of albums and songs forward with me since I was a teenager. We’re talking about thousands of albums, dozens of playlists, and a lot of complications that have stuck around in my library since the CD days.</p>

<p>Apple Music gobbled up all that music info and turned it into a frustrating mess for me. I have duplicate albums, duplicate tracks in my albums, unplayable tracks in some albums, and most of my library does not play in Apple Music’s new lossless format. A lot of music playing for me takes place <em>outside</em> my library, but that is in large part because my Apple Music library is an awful mess.</p>

<p>Today, I just couldn’t take the jankiness anymore, so I took the nuclear option: I deleted everything from from my Apple Music account. All my music is gone. I also turned off the “add songs from playlists added to library” option, which was inconsistently applied amongst my devices, and peppered my library with useless, one-track albums. I added some of the artists and albums I actually listen to now (as opposed to many years ago when I bought a used CD somewhere), and will rebuild my collection from there.</p>

<p>Despite my nuking of my Apple Music Library, None of the music I bought in the past is <em>really</em> gone. All the CDs I actually wanted to keep are ripped to a well-organized, if rarely touched, folder on my NAS. I will probably continue to ignore this, to be honest, and focus mainly on what’s new.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hours after Pfizer issued its statement, the FDA and Centers for Disease and Control issued a joint statement saying Americans do not need booster shots yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time,&rdquo; they said.</p>

<p>In a statement to CNN on Friday, the World Health Organization said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know whether booster vaccines will be needed to maintain protection against COVID-19 until additional data is collected,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;limited data available on how long the protection from current doses lasts and whether an additional booster dose would be beneficial and for whom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How you think about this comes all down to trust.</p>

<p>Who do you trust? The companies that developed the vaccines which appear to be far more effective against COVID-19 than we could have hoped? Or the government agencies that failed to provide the correct advice about COVID-19 prevention for months.</p>

<p>Who do you trust? The companies that are seeking to profit off a pandemic by pushing possibly unneeded booster shots, using scare tactics that are familiar from their marketing of other drugs? Or the government agencies who failed to coerce a huge chunk of the adult population to get vaccinated, due to a failure in messaging, incentives and coordination of rollout?</p>

<p>It may seem like I am arguing against the FDA, CDC, and WHO here. I don’t think I am, and I certainly have no data or expertise to refute either side’s claims. I am simply observing that these institutions are deservedly suffering from an erosion in public trust, and that is going to make any decision making based on what they say, or based on what pharmaceutical companies or health care providers say, more difficult.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>When I was in fourth grade, my family moved to the town across the river. The move was not traumatic, but it was socially isolating. We had to move out of our old house three months before our new house was finished being built. We ended up as the only tenants in an apartment complex across town from where we used to live. For the fall, I went to my old elementary school and saw my old neighborhood friends and familiar classmates during the day, but I saw no one my age outside of school during the week or on weekends. Besides my parents, I saw <em>no one</em> on nights and weekends.</p>

<p>As an only child, I could keep my own company. I watched a lot of TV that fall. I played a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.">Super Mario Brothers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Hunt">Duck Hunt</a>. By Christmas, I was so bored that I actually mastered playing Gyromite with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.O.B.">R.O.B. the Robot</a>, which is a game that is both preposterously difficult (I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/ocrTkuPMmvI">look at this</a>) and equally unrewarding.</p>

<p>On New Year’s Day we moved into our new house, which was newly built in in a new, single-road housing development that was not yet completed. The house was both awesome—so big! so new!—and lonely. It inhabited the unfinished end of the street; half our neighbors were empty lots. We didn’t have streetlights or mailboxes. Our front yard had no trees, no grass, and no bushes; it was a sea of straw, strewn over frozen mud. My best friend for the first week was the little TV in my room that I watched while my parents unpacked their things.</p>

<p>Starting over at school, and making what friends I could in my new, very small neighborhood—especially after months of social isolation—was tough. I would ask my parents how to make new friends in my new town, where the kids all dressed differently, talked differently, and cared about different things than the kids I was friends with in my prior life. How do you start talking to someone you don’t know without coming across like an idiot?</p>

<p>They would say, wisely, “just be yourself.” That was pretty much the only advice I ever got growing up about how to act, how to fit in, and how to be comfortable in new social situations. It is <em>terrible</em> advice.</p>

<p>When I moved to a new town, I didn’t need to “be myself.” I needed to <em>change</em> myself: to become someone flexible enough to adapt to my new situation, to meet new people halfway, to be more open to taking chances, and to care less about every moment that didn’t go so well. It took me a long time to figure that out, but I did. I adjusted. I made friends. I found my people. It took a long time, and over that time I changed myself into a person far more comfortable with who I was and who I wasn’t.</p>

<p>“Just be yourself” doesn’t mean “just be yourself.” It means <em>don’t hate yourself</em>. Truly. For every inch of “don’t change yourself to fit in” in those words, there is a mile of “put yourself out there, and don’t let yourself feel destroyed if it doesn’t work out.” Try, and try again, but don’t hate yourself when you fail to make a connection or have to put your foot in your mouth. Don’t hate yourself when you don’t measure up, don’t fit in, and don’t succeed.</p>

<p>So, when you face a new challenge in life, don’t be yourself. Be better.</p>

(Let’s just say my kids don’t sleep on July 4th.)</p>

<p>What does America mean to me?</p>

<p>It is a promise to do better, to try harder, to fight for justice and freedom, and to stand up again after being knocked down. It is a promise that is very, very hard to keep—one most often observed in its breach.</p>

<p>What has America actually been to me? All this noise around me, for years and years and years, drowning out the voices and the actions of serious, thoughtful people. I am one of the privileged few, but I too am lost and bewildered in my own country, <em>by</em> my own country.</p>

<p>America needs to be better, and for that, <em>Americans</em> need to act better. To start, we must demand better of each other.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/06/30/opensourcing-the-microblog.html">the Micro.blog client apps were open-sourced</a>, I reviewed the Github repos for the two I use most (the <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog/microblog-ios">iOS app</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog/microblog-mac/issues">macOS app</a>). I wondered if I could contribute something to the projects—probably something small, like more hardware keyboard shortcuts or an enhancement to how the post editor works. I wasn’t sure if that would be welcome, based on the brief “About the open source project…” verbiage in the REAMDE, and based on (1) the very old, but open, issues in the iOS repo, and (2) seeing no issues in the macOS repo.</p>

<p>I “know” Manton because I have been listening to <a href="https://coreint.org">his podcast with Daniel Jalkut</a> for years (which is where I learned about Micro.blog), so I think of him as thoughtful, considerate, and certainly not as unfriendly. But I did not actually expect him to open source the apps when he did, and I figure that her has a business to run and may not be ready for a bunch of user requests on client apps that he may be happy enough with already. Manton saw <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/07/02/on-opensourcing-the.html">my prior post about the apps</a> and commented on it: “I wrote that README quickly and should expand on it…”</p>

<p>In true blogging fashion, I am responding to his comment with this blog post, with the aim to be helpful to Manton as he thinks about how to expand on the README he wrote.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-look-for-in-an-open-source-project">What I look for in an open source project.</h2>

<p>Two things, really. Can I report an issue? And, can I contribute?</p>

<h3 id="issues">Issues</h3>

<p>Ideally the issues list will be kept current and will tie to development efforts (bug fixes and enhancements) going forward. Very old issues that the maintainer no longer wants worked on will be closed. Issues that the maintainer is interested in will be labeled “help wanted”, “good for beginners”, etc.</p>

<p>The maintainer should say in the README how user-reported issues will be addressed. It is OK to state that the maintainer does not plan to consider some or all feature requests from users. It is best to be open and realistic about how the project will operate.</p>

<h3 id="contributing">Contributing</h3>

<p>I always look for a CONTRIBUTING document or section in the README to learn whether or not the maintainer will accept pull requests, and if possible, how that process should work. Is opening an issue, then resolving it with a pull request later on, the right way or the wrong way to go about it? I have worked with maintainers who preferred that approach, to solicit conversation, and have worked with others who preferred the code change to come first and the discussion afterward.</p>

<p>Also, it is OK if the maintainer is not going to accept pull requests; I would rather know up front.</p>

<h3 id="the-future">The future</h3>

<p>I think it is perfectly OK if the way a project is maintained changes over time. Not every decision made on day one has to be carried out forever. As a potential contributor, I just like to know what I might expect if I approached the maintainer now.</p>

         	<p>On Thursday I configured NextDNS to block (for my personal devices only) news.google.com. Google News has been my Internet obsession since it debuted in 2002. It is not a healthy one. Whenever my mind gets lost for a second, I find myself opening a browser tab and checking Google News to see…what’s new, I guess. Sometimes I close Google News out of disgust or boredom and then, almost immediately, open it up again.</p>

<p>Why do I do this? What am I searching for? What is going on in my mind?</p>

<p>Reading the news seems like a worthwhile activity—something a thoughtful, intelligent person would do—but I am pretty sure that most of the time it isn’t. I think that news sites and cable networks exploit the part of our brains that are always scanning for threats and opportunities, as part of our survival instincts. In Paleolithic times, knowing if the tribe across the river is friendly or hostile, knowing where the good game is and where the predators are, and knowing what foods might kill you were all important to survival. All of that information is relevant and timely.</p>

<p>But that’s not what I get from Google News. I rarely learn about anything nearby that could possibly affect me. I usually learn about national affairs, faraway disasters, or (more recently) some else’s social media-published outrage about these things. It’s hard to say that provides me much benefit at all. So, for the time being, I’m turning it off. The news will still be there when I need it, but not packaged in such a way that hooks me and makes me feel virtuous for being hooked on it.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/07/02/on-opensourcing-the.html">On open-sourcing the Micro.blog client apps</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/07/02/on-opensourcing-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-07-02 22:24:16 -0400">Jul 2, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>This week <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/06/30/opensourcing-the-microblog.html">open-sourced the iOS and macOS Micro.blog apps</a>. I think that is a great move in general, but it is not one of the things I require in the software I use. I never felt that comfortable when, a while ago now, I read users’ blog posts expressing anger or dismay that the client apps were not open-sourced. (Let’s put aside, for now, that what makes Micro.blog <em>work</em> is the server-side code.)</p>

<p>As a paying customer, and as a developer myself, I don’t think Manton and his team are obligated to share their client source code with me. I don’t think anyone is. If they want to, that’s great—but it is no guarantee that the client app itself will be better, more secure, more feature-rich, or even have a future many years from now. Heck, <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog/microblog-ios/blob/master/README.md">it doesn’t even look likely that Micro.blog will accept pull requests</a>, so it is unclear whether open-sourcing it will change its development direction or iteration time at all. I’m not complaining about that, though. Maintaining an open source project/community and running a successful blog hosting business are almost entirely orthogonal to each other. Open source doesn’t really give me added comfort that an app I love or depend on will be there for me forever, because nothing is forever, even open-source software projects.</p>

<p>As a computer user and enthusiast, I used to care a lot more that I do now about free, libre, and open-source software. My primary reason was that I thought I could trust it more than closed source software. It is harder to hide malware, tracking, and obvious security flaws when the code is publicly viewable. History has shown that not to be entirely true. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Remember Heartbleed</a>? That incident showed us that widely used libraries may be maintained by only one or two people, and their source code can contain bugs and security flaws that go unnoticed for years, because no one is actually looking at the source code.</p>

<p>My secondary reason for preferring open-source software was more theoretical, but larger in scope and more exciting to me: open-source software can be a more practical and a better use of humanity’s programming resources. That’s because one of the great, unfulfilled promises of computer science is the ability to solve a certain problem once and for all, for everybody. Open source utilities, like the Unix command line tools, and open-source libraries, like OpenSSL, theoretically could make this happen. But it didn’t happen, at least not fully. We spend a lot of time, collectively, solving the same software problems over and over again. We may approach these problems in new ways, with new languages, and on new platforms. But in the end, we are repeating ourselves. Imagine where we could be if we didn’t keep repeat ourselves!</p>

<p>I actually think that most of the repetition is the inevitable result of human nature. Humans are curious; we want to know how something works, and how to do it ourselves. Humans are also prideful: we think “I can do the same thing, but better.” Most importantly, humans need to learn; each of us is born knowing nothing, and must learn extensively from our forebears to push our collective knowledge out just a little further.</p>

<p>In the end, what is most useful to me about Micro.blog open-sourcing its codebase is that I can look at it and learn from it. That could be very helpful. Long ago, I was interested in creating a dead-simple iOS app (extension, widget, whatever) for Micropub posting. Eventually, well before this week, Micro.blog open-sourced its <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog/snippets">Snippets</a> library, which would have made writing such an app much easier. Now, with the client app <em>also</em> open sourced, I could review <em>its</em> code to see (presumably) how to call, configure, and use the Snippets library in an iOS app. That is even more useful than the Snippets library alone.</p>

<p>Now that the Micro.blog client app source code is free and open, maybe I could use some of it to help me build that little utility app now. In the same vein, maybe someone else could use much more of that source code and build a better, more feature-rich client app based on it. Maybe the Micro.blog app is a solved problem, and no one has to solve it again (at least until Apple stops supporting the frameworks it is based on), and a hundred other Micropub-blogging-based small businesses could spring up, all using a common client app. Who knows? That possibility is a risk to Manton and Micro.blog, but it is also a gift to the greater world.</p>

<p>Thanks, <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a>, <a href="https://micro.blog/cheesemaker">@cheesemaker</a>, and <a href="https://micro.blog/jean">@jean</a> (are there others at Micro.blog?) for all the work you do.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/06/30/on-bullies-or.html">On bullies, or why I have character</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/06/30/on-bullies-or.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-06-30 21:45:42 -0400">Jun 30, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I often joke with people that I am not as nice as my wife is. It’s a self-deprecating remark, but I do mean it. I <em>am</em> a nice person, just not <em>as</em> nice as my wife is.</p>

<p>I’m not <em>as</em> nice because I was bullied for most of my childhood. I never got beaten up (though I did get into fights), and I was never afraid to go to school (though it was a gauntlet and a crucible), but I was picked on mercilessly, incessantly, and for *everything*—my name, my weight, my glasses, and most of all for being smart.</p>

<p>When I was a young adult, I would say that the bullying led me to develop *character*—and, man, I wish I didn’t have character! As a middle-aged adult, I find myself wondering what that bullying really taught me. I think, in a huge way, it taught me to distrust people—especially people my own age. It taught me not to take what people said to me at face value, because venomous words are often preceded by honeyed ones. It taught me that others may switch from allies to enemies when the social situation changes, like when the bullies enter the scene.</p>

<p>One of my triumphs in life was when I finally made the bullying stop. After years of trying different things—there is a lot of well-meaning advice for the bullied out there to follow—what finally made the bullying stop was a 30-second conversation I had with one of my bullies, in the back of a classroom on the first day of seventh grade. After being on the receiving end of some stupid taunt, I had had enough. I turned to the kid, looked him in the eye, and said to him: “You can say whatever you want to me. You can call me whatever names you want. But you can never hurt me. You can never change my mind about myself, no matter what you do.”</p>

<p>For some reason I still can’t figure out, the name calling, the taunting, and the scapegoating stopped overnight—not just from that one kid; from everybody. I didn’t become popular or anything, but I was mentally strong, and everyone knew it. The bullies just stopped bullying me. I was no longer a social pariah. I made a lot of new friends that year. Even some of the kids who picked on me even became my friends before the school year was through.</p>

<p>That single exchange, by itself, probably did not cause the bullying to stop. Asserting that I was mentally stronger than my bullies probably would not have worked unless it were really true. It was the last of a series of defenses I developed over the years. It was the strongest one, but I may not have developed it if I hadn’t developed others before it, like wit, determination, and resilience.</p>

<p>Bullying has shaped me to be someone who, as I have been told, does not suffer fools gladly. It has made me wary of people and likely to question others’ intentions, which is a great skill in political situations and in some professional situations, but it isn’t that useful for socializing at a picnic. It has also shaped me into someone who has tremendous sympathy for the downtrodden, quiet underdogs of the world. I can empathize with the pain of others. I know that true friends are rare and precious. I know that inner strength is hard won.</p>

<p>I also know that I am not as nice as other people, because other people were not as nice to me. So I try, really hard, to be nice, even when it is difficult, because people deserve better than I got when I was a kid.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have recently finished crafting a slideshow, and writing a talk to go with it, that is the best one I have ever done, probably by a mile. I spent hundreds of hours this year watching talks on YouTube (both good and bad ones), watching instructional videos on speaking and on creating effective visual presentations, and trying new slide design techniques (and throwing out all the things I tried that didn’t work). I tried really hard to push myself out of my PowerPoint design rut. I thought I was good at presenting <em>before</em>, but now I think I have really leveled up. I have internalized a lot of the lessons I learned this year.</p>

<p>The most visually impressive, most engaging, most well written talk that I have ever created is due to my bosses tomorrow. It is complete. It would make for a great 80 minute talk. But it has to be cut, and maybe cut down by half. It was momentarily agonizing to learn this today, but I am trying to think positively about it, because I have learned the right way to cut (iteratively, though rehearsals and timing of sections) and I know how to not cut the meat out of the presentation (because I wrote down the main idea of each section, so it wouldn’t get lost in an edit). I can do it. I just wish I didn’t have to.</p>

<p>No matter what, though, I’m going to be proud of what I built, and I’m going to seek out more opportunities to present in the future. I <em>am</em> good at it. I put in the work to be even better at it. And maybe with enough practice I can be great at it.</p>

         	<p>One of the difficulties my family has had due to the pandemic is finding a suitable summer camp experience for my nine-year-old daughter. She <em>loves</em> camp, and there was <em>no</em> camp last year. This summer, we opted for what we thought was the safest camp option: a drama camp that promised to be outside only (under tents and such) or virtual if the weather was bad (presumably, if it rained).</p>

<p>Yesterday, a day before camp starts (which is today), the camp changed its terms. It would count heat and humidity as bad weather and would move camp indoors pretty much full time, based on the weather forecasts we have around here. The camp surveyed parents over the weekend and the majority of the parents presumably agreed to this. We, however, did not.</p>

<p>My wife is trying to find an alternative camp now, which is not easy last minute (at least around here). Camps start enrolling in October (which seems absolutely crazy to me). I hope she can work something out.</p>

<p>What I find frustrating about summer now (and this is in New Jersey, not exactly in the South) is that the heat, humidity, air quality, and afternoon thunderstorms make outdoor activities incredibly difficult. It seems like summer is not a good time for summer camp anymore, which doesn’t make sense.</p>

         	<p>My work week has overflowed with head-desk moments, turnarounds, and setbacks. It has been frustrating beyond belief. It’s not often that I experience big parts of my work projects blowing up in my face, especially for unexpected reasons. Fortunately, all the problems I am facing are technology-related, not interpersonal, and can, I think, be solved by doing something I, by nature, kind of hate doing: asking for help.</p>

<p>I am trying to change my mindset from “I can’t do this anymore” to “I can do this. I may need help. And it may take longer than expected.” It sounds simple, but it really isn’t. For whatever reason, whatever I picked up from the self-help and coaching industries over the years taught me a misleading lesson about personal achievement, which basically boils down to “it’s mind over matter.” But sometimes, the problem really is matter—the external roadblocks, rather than the internal ones. At least, that’s what I think about this week’s challenge. If I can’t remove those roadblocks myself, then maybe someone else can help me.</p>

         	<p>My wife teaches speech, debate, and dramatic arts to high school students. I love it when she asks me to help her with her lesson plans, because it gives me the chance to take a subject that she has to teach, however uninteresting it may seem (especially if you’ve taught it for 10+ years in a row), and blow it up into something that is the foundation of everything.</p>

<p>Here’s an exchange we had this spring:</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: What’s the curriculum?</p>

<p><strong>Her</strong>: Persuasive speech.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: <em>All</em> speech is persuasive speech.</p>

<p><strong>Her</strong>: That’s not helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: But it’s true!</p>

<p>I always encourage her to start new topics with audacious statements that demand defending. I’m not sure if she ever does, but I think it is important to tie everything you learn about writing and speaking with the fundamental forces that drive communication.</p>

<p>In another life, I would have ended up teaching English at some level, too. I think I would make an excellent high school teach for one or two very smart kids, and a potentially disastrous one for everyone else.</p>

         	<p>“Real artists ship.” Steve Jobs said that to motivate the Macintosh team in 1983. It’s a statement that reverberates in my mind and absolutely drives me crazy sometimes. Why? Because I have tons of code that I haven’t shipped. Hell, some of my <em>best</em> code hasn’t shipped.</p>

<p>At some point, I lost my nerve. I couldn’t finish the projects I started. I couldn’t make a small change to a UI because it would inevitably spiral out into something that would require a rewrite of the entire app. I let new components I created lie unused. I let the revisions and extensions I had written for my apps linger and die on the vine. I couldn’t integrate the pieces into a coherent whole.</p>

<p>I let myself become too tired or too distracted to focus on the problems in front of me. I couldn’t resolve the problems I had created for myself. I couldn’t think straight, and didn’t trust that I could do it anymore.</p>

<p>I realize now that I was bumping into my limits as a developer, which is scary and frustrating. I opted to run away from these limits rather than to either work past them or to accept them. I am trying to do better and not get bogged down in all the feelings I have developed about this over the past couple years.</p>

<p>In the past I have failed. But I am trying to work through it now, to push past the fear, to move from “I can’t do this” to “I <em>can</em> do this,” and to get through the hard parts of getting my best code shipped. I can do it this time, and I won’t give up. All it takes is will, grit, and patience.</p>

The reader knows her own name, and it is written on the screen in the “To” field next to her email address. Why do I write it again in the body of the email? Why do I do this 50 times every workday? Why do I do this even though I think it is redundant?</p>

<p>Simple: Because I think that everyone’s favorite word is their own name. Everyone likes to see it. It’s subtle flattery to include it atop the body of every email message. Whenever I think I should just stop my habit of typing it, I remind myself of this and keep going with it, because I think in the end it is worthwhile.</p>

<p>I loved the first season, and hope they can keep what make season 1 so engaging keep going. It wasn’t the cuteness of Ted’s cheery attitude. It was the overcoming of cynicism in everybody else that made it interesting. You need that cynicism to be there for there to be genuine tension between the characters.</p>

<p>The previews make the think that that tension is completely gone, at least among the main cast. I hope the writers came up with new ways to explore conflicts and create drama that don’t lean too much on tired TV tropes (new characters, character personality resets, and so on).</p>

<p>I just want it to be <em>good</em>. Ted would urge me to BELIEVE!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>One of the best lessons that literature has taught me is that the bad guy <em>thinks</em> he’s the good guy. In more abstract terms, the villain thinks she is the hero of her own story. That is what drives villains, and that is what makes them dangerous.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as in real life, the villain may in fact <em>be</em> the hero of his own story, because the story as we know it isn’t over, and it isn’t about what we thought it was about. Any narrative can have a counter narrative. Every comedy might be someone else’s tragedy.</p>

<p>All of this is true in life as it is in art.</p>

<p>There are real villains in the real world, and we need real heroes to face them. But there are a lot of false villains in our lives that we also face. These false villains may be people we are mad at momentarily, people we are close to who frustrate us, people who shun us, people who are indifferent to us, and so on. These false villains may also be ourselves—the fears and doubts that hold us back, the shames we keep secret from ourselves, and the pasts that we cannot change.</p>

<p>We must be careful not to think of these false villains as the real ones. Not all stories need a hero to resolve them. When we play the hero, we may unknowingly be playing the villain instead.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I am teaching my daughter how to solve problems. <em>Math</em> problems.</p>

<p>I find or think up challenging math problems for her (she is a third grader), and, to make them more fun, I rewrite them to include mention of her friends and family, favorite characters, and favorite things. We work through them together before bedtime. It’s fun, and we both get a lot out of it.</p>

<p>I always close our math session by asking her a question. The questions I ask are meant to spark introspection and, I hope, foster self-worth: <em>What is something you like about yourself? What is something you like to do? What is something are you good at? What are some things people you like have in common?</em></p>

<p>The questions I want <em>her</em> to ask in life—when learning new things, when engaging with people, and when confronting political forces in the world—are the big, probing kind: <em>What is this all about? Why is it important? What does that even mean? How do you know?</em></p>

<p>These are simple questions, but they carry a lot of weight when asked earnestly, and also when asked recursively to get to the bottom of something. They are at the forefront of my mind all the time (especially <em>how do you know?</em>) because I believe they are at the heart of thoughtful inquiry. (They may also be at the heart of skepticism or even a healthy distrust, but that is something for me to unpack later.)</p>

<p>As a father, I have no idea how to teach her to ask these questions. How do you teach someone to <em>not be afraid</em> to ask these questions? How do you teach someone to <em>not get upset</em> at the answers? How do you teach someone to deal with indifference, rejection, or even malice? I don’t know. I can only ask her big questions enough times for her to get used to them.</p>

<p>As she grows older and more confident, the other big questions I want her to ask are: <em>What can I do?</em> and <em>Why not me?</em> Those questions are even harder to ask, harder to answer, and I certainly don’t have the right answers to them. Part of the my journey through fatherhood is to try to figure them out.</p>

         	<p>I already know that one of my Father&rsquo;s Day presents is a nice warm L.L. Bean blanket. It&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;m old and need a nap. It&rsquo;s for watching TV at night in the summer. To keep our upstairs anywhere near comfortable for sleeping, our central air has to work very hard. This makes our TV room, which is one of the lowest rooms in the house, absolutely freezing.</p>

<p>My house has central air but we also have room air conditioners in two of the upstairs bedrooms because the central air is not enough to cool them. I think that the root of the problem is that our house does not have enough ductwork upstairs. My house was built in 1980. I wonder if the central air system was designed for 1980 levels of heat, which were lower on average, because it certainly can&rsquo;t keep up with 2020 levels for the top half of the house.</p>

<p>I could be wrong about that, because I see climate change all over the place around me, and it might just be fatalism on my part. But I think I am at least partially right.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about how I can be better at everything I do. I&rsquo;m trying to build myself up, brick by brick, after whatever the heck happened to me during the COVID-19 pandemic. (One weird thing I noticed is that I have started to <em>prefix</em> the pandemic with a descriptor. It&rsquo;s as if I imagine we will need to differentiate between several.) I am teaching myself new things. I am taking more chances. I am talking to more people. I am trying harder to focus on what is vital.</p>

<p>The effort has been paying off; at first slowly, and now more quickly every week. I think, as the weeks keep going by, I will seek out more opportunities to do good things, to grow, and to connect with the world again.</p>

         	<p>Last night I became unreasonably upset that UIKit does not let me use an inline date picker (the date picker control that looks like a calendar) as an input view (i.e., in place of the software keyboard on the iPhone). There is some kind of maximum height of the input view/keyboard area, and the top of the date picker gets truncated. I tried a lot of ways to make it work, but I guess I’ll have to wrap it in a popover and have some “special cases” code paths in my view controller to make it work. How frustrating! I just need about 15 points more vertical space!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin is also traceable. While the digital currency can be created, moved and stored outside the purview of any government or financial institution, each payment is recorded in a permanent fixed ledger, called the blockchain.</p>

<p>That means all Bitcoin transactions are out in the open. The Bitcoin ledger can be viewed by anyone who is plugged into the blockchain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin was never really anonymous. It is pseudonymous, so it makes sense that transactions can be traced to some extent and tied to a unique owner or wallet.</p>

<p>What is interesting is not <em>just</em> that law enforcement can identify which Bitcoin wallet was involved in the fraud, but also that law enforcement could also crack the wallet’s password and retrieve/steal the money out of it. I wonder how. Was it a weak password? Was it social engineering? Was it a brute-force password crack? If so, was it cracked by a normal computer or by a quantum computer that no one else knows about?</p>

<p>Bitcoin seems fundamentally broken to me. I won’t touch it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Adam Zeman didn’t give much thought to the mind’s eye until he met someone who didn’t have one. In 2005, the British neurologist saw a patient who said that a minor surgical procedure had taken away his ability to conjure images.</p>

<p>Over the 16 years since that first patient, Dr. Zeman and his colleagues have heard from more than 12,000 people who say they don’t have any such mental camera. The scientists estimate that tens of millions of people share the condition, which they’ve named aphantasia, and millions more experience extraordinarily strong mental imagery, called hyperphantasia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I read a book, I never think about what the characters look like, or what the scenery is.</p>

<p>When I think, it’s all words. Torrents and torrent of words.</p>

<p>I don’t have the best visual memory for people or places, though I have good spatial awareness.</p>

<p>I think I <em>can</em> form mental images, or at least simulacra of them (wireframes, maybe). I mean, I did pretty well in organic chemistry in college, which is a subject that is, in part, about visualizing the rotation of irregularly shaped molecules. I don’t think I <em>saw</em> them in my mind’s eye, though. Not really. It was long ago, so I can’t remember reliably, but I probably figured out a different way to do it.</p>

<p>To me, it is interesting to learn that some people “see” mental images easily and think in an incredibly visual manner, because that is not the way I experience anything.</p>

         	<p>I discovered today that <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/427263/how-to-change-the-mouse-pointer-color-and-size-on-windows-10/">Windows 10 lets you change your mouse cursor’s <em>color</em></a> as well as its size. You have been able to change the mouse cursor <em>set</em> to a different one since Windows 3, I think, which would allow you to switch the color in a different, less flexible way. This feature is different.</p>

<p>I now have a slightly larger, bright-yellow-with-black-outline mouse cursor on my huge 4K monitor. It is much easier to spot when I am returning to my desk after a break. If only Microsoft implemented the “shake that mouse and the cursor gets bigger” feature from macOS.</p>

         	<p>My region’s climate has changed significantly in my lifetime, and, seemingly to me, more quickly than before in the past ten years. It is dismaying. Here are some of my observations of it from this week:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It has been over 90ºF every day since late last week, and it is only early June. Ninety degrees is not just hot for June here: it is hot for <em>summer</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>My daughter’s elementary school has two early release days in a row this week, due to excessive heat. I have heard of such things happening in the South, but never where I have lived (New Jersey now, New England before that).</p></li>

<li><p>People (including my family) don’t have our kids play outside that much because is too hot, and the air quality too bad, to do so.</p></li>

<li><p>I saw more people exercising after dark (after 9 PM) yesterday than I did out during the daytime.</p></li>

         	<p>I enjoyed <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/05/24/burnout-modern-affliction-or-human-condition">Jill Lepore&rsquo;s recent article on burnout</a> in <em>The New Yorker</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Burnout is a combat metaphor. In the conditions of late capitalism, from the Reagan era forward, work, for many people, has come to feel like a battlefield, and daily life, including politics and life online, like yet more slaughter. People across all walks of life—rich and poor, young and old, caretakers and the cared for, the faithful and the faithless—really are worn down, wiped out, threadbare, on edge, battered, and battle-scarred. Lockdowns, too, are features of war, as if each one of us, amid not only the pandemic but also acts of terrorism and mass shootings and armed insurrections, were now engaged in a Hobbesian battle for existence, civil life having become a war zone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lepore argues for cultural and economic origins for burnout, which make for a useful lens through which to study the phenomenon. Personally, I think the burnout really is a manifestation of depression, specifically of high-functioning depression coupled with exhaustion. Lepore touches on this, too.</p>

<p>Burnout still feels like its own thing to me, because I experience the feeling at my desk during the work day. Fortunately, I have learned (or am still learning) to slow down and demand less of myself, and of those around me, when I am feeling burnt out.</p>

Often when I do this, while I wait for builds to complete or unit tests to execute, I pick up my Rubik’s Cube and solve it (or scramble it, if it is already solved). For the past three days, I could not solve my Rubik’s Cube anymore. I couldn’t remember how to do it, and I kept making mistakes even in the earlier portions of my solve. I worried that I had forgotten how to do it overnight, and the implications of that scared me.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I solved the cube again today again without an issue. It was a great relief. I think that I was so deep into technical problems for so long that I lost the plasticity of mind I usually have.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	

<p>The latest episode of <a href="https://atp.fm">Accidental Tech Podcast</a> has <a href="https://overcast.fm/+R7DXCWO3Y/26:33">a great discussion about lossless music</a>, which is coming to Apple Music next month.</p>

<p>I am 1000% the target audience for lossless and hi-res audio, and very excited for <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/">Apple Music</a> to stream CD quality audio (and sometimes 24bit/96KHz). Even I readily admit I can’t hear the difference most of the time; but sometimes I can, especially on my best equipment. Moreover, I like the idea of getting the best possible quality up to my capacity to hear it (meaning “CD quality” not “hi-res”).</p>

<p>I look forward to reading the 2021 M1 iMac reviews later, even though I will likely never buy that computer. It’s the sort of thing I <em>would</em> want if my family were structured more around, say, a central computing location in the family room or something. We all have iPads instead.</p>

<h1 id="webex-has-virtual-backgrounds">WebEx has virtual backgrounds?!</h1>

<p>A software update at work pushed out the virtual backgrounds feature for WebEx. Since my home office—at least the part of it that is <em>behind</em> me and not under my control— is a mess, I enabled it.</p>

<p>Sadly, it looks pretty awful. The background mostly leaves a halo around me un-obscured; sometimes it clips portions of my face or shoulder off. I have a very high-end laptop and a “very good” Logitech webcam (all webcams are terrible, I think), so I have concluded that WebEx’s technology is way behind Zoom’s, which does the virtual backgrounds flawlessly. I think I will leave virtual backgrounds on, for privacy reasons, and hope no one minds the weird visual side effects.</p>

<p>I did not have to wait long for the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/">Apple Music announcement</a> to drop.</p>

<p>Apple Music can release its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439885/apple-music-tease-hi-fi-lossless-music-streaming">rumored lossless tier</a> any minute now. I’m waiting with my best headphones. I don’t care at all about spatial audio or Dolby Atmos, though, so I hope that isn’t the only kind of thing coming.</p>

<h1 id="apple-is-poised-to-lose-its-antitrust-battle">Apple is Poised to Lose its Antitrust Battle</h1>

<p>I think that Apple is going to lose whatever antitrust cases are eventually brought against it in the EU and in the US. I don’t actually think Apple <em>should</em> lose, because I don’t think it is correct to call Apple a monopoly.</p>

<p>The general antitrust argument against Apple is that its App Store platform is too locked down, and that is unfair because Apple is a monopoly (insert eye roll here) of its own platform. App is a platform owner. Of course it has a “monopoly” over the platform it owns. That doesn’t make it a monopoly in the overall marketplace. Moreover, while iOS is undoubtedly popular, it is a <em>minority</em> smartphone platform, which in the broadest legal terms that I understand, makes monopoly-related antitrust law not apply to them.</p>

<p>App developers have to accept Apple’s terms, and pay a pretty large commission to Apple, to distribute apps in the store or to take in-app purchases. That may not feel fair to developers, but I can’t take seriously the arguments that it is illegal. It is the same way that game consoles work. Will we go after Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft next? Shouldn’t they open up their game consoles to alternative payment systems and alternate app stores, too? I have heard of no one seriously arguing this.</p>

<p>The most compelling argument against Apple’s App Store requirements is that Apple demands too much money from developers for distribution and payment solutions that other companies now offer at lower prices. I am sympathetic to this argument because I too think Apple should have lowered its commission over the years, as marginal costs for these technologies and services have declined. However, the size of Apple’s cut is not really at issue here. Apple, rather clumsily, lowered its commission for a majority of its developers to 15%, starting in January 2021, but the antitrust talk just keeps rolling on.</p>

<p>The second most compelling argument against Apple is that it uses its platform-owner advantage to position its own software and services over third-party competitors. Again, I sympathize. Apple Sherlocks developers sometimes, and can position its own software and services over anyone else’s. So does Microsoft (ever use Windows?). Amazon exercises a tremendous advantage over third party sellers in its online marketplace.</p>

<p>I could argue that even Linux vendors, such as Ubuntu, position their own, preferred software over that of third-party developers. Software platform owners always have advantages over third parties that operate on their platform. Extracting as much value from that as is possible is the entire point of creating and owning a platform. I think it only becomes an antitrust problem when a company has majority market share, which Apple does not have.</p>

<p>If developers can’t accept Apple’s terms, then they shouldn’t. They should develop for Android instead, which has the majority market share anyway, or create progressive web apps. (Remember, the web is an app platform, too, not just a way to collect credit card payments for software.) If developers “need” to develop for iOS because iOS users, on average, spend way more money on apps than Android users, then that just shows the value Apple’s marketplace has, and <em>is</em> worth paying for.</p>

<p>Despite my views, I still think Apple is poised to lose any legal actions about them regarding monopoly. It won’t lose based on the merits of whatever case is brought against it; it will lose because enough political sentiment is against Apple, at least in this area, and that is all that matters. Perhaps all the tech giants will fall under this scrutiny, and all will be forced to open up their platforms more widely, and will be forced to renounce their first-party advantage when distributing applications and features. I just don’t see that actually happening, and if it does happen, I don’t think it will benefit anybody in the way government regulators would expect. It could even stifle the development of the next generation of technology platforms.</p>

<h1 id="is-a-higher-quality-apple-music-tier-on-the-way">Is a higher-quality Apple Music tier on the way?</h1>

<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2021/05/is-a-higher-quality-apple-music-tier-on-the-way/">I hope so.</a> I am a sucker for lossless codecs, even though I probably can’t hear the difference between them and AAC-256.</p>

<p>I have been using SQL for 25 years and I just learned today that <code>SELECT [...] FROM Table1, Table2</code> is called a “<a href="https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-basics/sql-server-cross-join/">cross join</a>” an can also be expressed as <code>SELECT [...] FROM Table1 CROSS JOIN Table2</code>. 🤦 In my defense, I must say that I have only had to use a cross join a few times in my entire career.</p>

<p>I unblocked Reddit.com earlier this week because the domain keeps coming up in tech question-related search results. After only a few days, I’m back looking at mechanical keyboards and expensive headphones on Reddit like an addict. I just blocked the domain again.</p>

<h1 id="durgod-zeus-engine-upgrade">⌨️ Durgod Zeus Engine Upgrade</h1>

<p>To my complete surprise, I discovered today that Durgod released an update to their keyboard configuration: Durgod Zeus Engine. The interface looks a lot better, and it is a little easier to use. They didn’t change the keyboard hardware driver to support function layers, which is unfortunately. I really want that. (Honestly, what I want is the ObinsKit software that powers the Anne Pro 2 to apply work on it.)</p>

<p>I set up a new RGB color scheme and remapped my CapsLock to Control, saved them to the keyboard’s local profile, and (out of habit) configured the Zeus Engine to <em>not</em> start every time I log on. I plugged my keyboard into my USB hub and will keep my fingers crossed that it will work reliably now.</p>

<h1 id="report-apple-s-m2-chips-may-launch-as-soon-as-july-2021">Report: Apple’s M2 chips may launch as soon as July 2021</h1>

<p><a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/report-apples-m2-chips-may-launch-as-soon-as-july-2021">Napier Lopez reports in <em>The Next Web</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple only just released its new iMacs featuring the acclaimed M1 ARM-based processor, but according to a report from Nikkei, the company plans to launch M2 as soon as July.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know anything in particular about Apple’s plans, but it seems crazy to me to expect a faster chip at this time. What I would expect is more I/O, driven by more cores and supported by more RAM. Of course, I could be wrong. Maybe Apple can overvolt the M1 to get more speed out of it, and will call it by another name.</p>

<p>I am very conservative about cities re-opening too soon, considering the pandemic has not ended. But <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/29/new-york-city-mayor-bill-de-blasio-says-the-city-will-re-open-100percent-on-july-1.html">NYC reopening on July 1</a> almost seems reasonable to me. Time will tell.</p>

<p>🎵 I’m going to lean into my New Jersey-ness today and listen to a ton of Bruce Springsteen. First album up: <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-wild-the-innocent-the-e-street-shuffle/186149850"><em>The Wild, The Innocent, &amp; the E Street Shuffle</em></a>. This is one of Springsteen’s records that I never think to listen to, but, of course, it’s great. It was made back when Springsteen still wrote songs with a torrent of stream-of-consciousness-style lyrics like a verbose street poet.</p>

<h1 id="microsoft-is-changing-the-default-office-font-and-wants-your-help-to-pick-a-new-one">Microsoft is changing the default Office font and wants your help to pick a new one</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407297/microsoft-office-new-default-font-2022">Per Tom Warren In <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is changing its default Office font next year and wants everyone to help pick the new default. While there are more than 700 font options in Word, Microsoft has commissioned five new custom fonts for Office, in a move away from the Calibri font that has been the default in Microsoft Office for nearly 15 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am unusually attached to Calibri so I am not looking forward to this change. Then again, at work I often have to publish using Arial Narrow, which I think is objectively awful in terms of aesthetics and legibility, so it probably won’t affect me too much.</p>

<h1 id="amazon-vine-review-pomelohome-bread-knife-8-serrated-stainless-steel-bread-knife-german-high-carbon-steel-serrated-knife">Amazon Vine Review: PomeloHome Bread Knife | 8&rdquo; Serrated Stainless Steel Bread Knife | German High Carbon Steel Serrated Knife</h1>

<h2 id="4-stars">4 Stars</h2>

<h3 id="looks-great-but-i-don-t-love-the-shape-of-the-handle">Looks great, but I don’t love the shape of the handle</h3>

<p>Overall, this bread knife is pretty good, but its straight shape provides poor knuckle clearance, which makes cutting loaves with hard bottom crusts more difficult than it should be. A curved or tapered blade is a better design.</p>

<p>The coolest thing about this knife is that it is one piece of metal from tip to handle. That is appealing to me in terms of durability, especially because I am in the middle of getting rid of a set of knives from another brand because their handles are falling apart.</p>

<p>I could not tell it from the product photos, but the shape of the handle is roughly triangular: it is slimmer at the bottom than at the top. It looks cool in photos, but it isn’t the best ergonomically for me because there is a less surface area than I am used to to grip on the bottom of the knife.</p>

<p>The blade is made of high-carbon steel, which is exactly what you want in a kitchen knife because it promises to retain sharpness for a long time.</p>

<h1 id="the-sequence">The Sequence 🎮</h1>

<p>Yesterday I decided to re-play a game I loved a few years ago called <em><a href="http://ombgames.com/?p=121">[The Sequence]</a></em>. It is a puzzle game where you, essentially, build a machine with various component parts to move a ball (well, the game calls it a “binary cell”) from one part of the screen to another. It sounds simple, and it starts out fairly simple, but it becomes very challenging as you progress. It’s the sort of game a programmer, or anyone who enjoyed <em><a href="https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine">Human Resource Machine</a></em> would enjoy.</p>

<h1 id="fez">Fez 🎮</h1>

<p>I am delighted that I discovered a video game that is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/fez-switch/">new to the Nintendo Switch</a>, but not at all new to the world, called <a href="http://www.fezgame.com">Fez</a>. This is the game’s official blurb:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gomez is a 2D creature living in a 2D world. Or is he? When the existence of a mysterious 3rd dimension is revealed to him, Gomez is sent out on a journey that will take him to the very end of time and space. Use your ability to navigate 3D structures from 4 distinct classic 2D perspectives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is a 2D puzzle platformer where your character can rotate the environment left or right 90 degrees at a time, but you always interact with the environment in two dimensions. Some of the puzzles are quite challenging, but I think that the most hidden secrets that you can get from solving the hardest puzzles are all optional to completing the game. It’s a charming game, and easily my favorite Switch game of this year so far.</p>

<h1 id="the-shooting-likely-lasted-one-or-two-minutes">The shooting likely lasted one or two minutes.</h1>

<p>I am unsettled today by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/16/us/indianapolis-fedex-shooting#the-attack-is-the-latest-in-a-recent-series-of-mass-shootings-in-the-us">yet another mass shooting</a> in my country. It seems like not a day goes by without a <em>New York Times</em> news alert about it. (I plan to turn those alerts off after I finish writing this.) This time, a gunman killed seven people, then himself. This detail about the story jumped out at me: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/16/us/indianapolis-fedex-shooting#shooting-at-a-fedex-warehouse-in-indianapolis-leaves-8-dead">The shooting likely lasted one or two minutes</a>.”</p>

<p>I think the news media covers mass shootings like they are exciting, like some kind of action movie where bad outcomes only happen to the extras, and the rest of us get to watch. But “one or two minutes” isn’t an action movie. It isn’t something exciting. It’s actually, really, really stupid. That such a thing is even possible, outside a war, is embarrassing and shameful to all of us. I wish it were more widely considered to be.</p>

<h1 id="iphone-13-mini-could-be-the-last-mini-iphone-says-kuo">iPhone 13 mini could be the last &lsquo;mini&rsquo; iPhone, says Kuo</h1>

<p>Stephen Warwick reports in <em>iMore</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kuo says that next year Apple will drop the 5.4-inch model and run with two 6.1-inch models instead, one Pro, one regular.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This rumor is a prime reason I upgraded to the iPhone 12 mini early this year. I absolutely love the size and weight of it. It fits better in my hands and in my pockets than my iPhone 7 Plus ever did. However, the 12 mini’s small screen size makes it less compelling to read on, edit photos on, or watch videos on. These are all things I do pretty much every day without complaint, but if it were going to be my only portable device I would have bought one with a bigger screen.</p>

<p>I have no desire to go back to a larger phone, because the phone, for me, is one tool among many, rather than the center of my computing universe. It doesn’t have to be compelling, just useful. It doesn’t have to be used constantly, just when it makes the most sense to.</p>

<p>Some time from now, I think the smartphone, as a thing I carry around all the time, and as the default “Internet communication device,” is going to disappear and be replaced by something else: smart glasses maybe, or some kind of earpiece (when I am really old and need hearing aides).</p>

<h1 id="my-first-nuget-package">My First NuGet Package</h1>

<p>Last night, I published my first <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/what-is-nuget">NuGet</a> package: <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/TodoTxt.Library/1.0.0">TodoTxt.Library</a>. It is a code library meant to help develop <a href="http://todotxt.org">todo.txt</a> applications in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">.NET</a>.</p>

<p>I wrote the code back in 2015, <a href="https://github.com/mjdescy/TodoTxt.Library">open-sourced it on GitHub</a>, but otherwise left it alone because I had moved on to more macOS and iOS development by that time. This week, I upgraded the code base work on .NET 5, so that it is cross platform (rather than Windows-only, as was my original version), and figured out how to package it and upload it to NuGet, where it may have a shot at actually being used.</p>

<h1 id="microsoft-announces-surface-laptop-4-with-choice-of-intel-or-amd-processors">Microsoft announces Surface Laptop 4 with choice of Intel or AMD processors</h1>

<p>Tom Warren’s article on <em>The Verge</em> caught my eye:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is refreshing its Surface lineup with the Surface Laptop 4 today, which now offers the choice between AMD or Intel processors across both the 13.5- and 15-inch models. Both sizes will ship with Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors or AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series processors. Microsoft is shipping its Surface Laptop 4 on April 15th in the US, Canada, and Japan, starting at $999 for the AMD model and $1,299 for the Intel version — a $300 price gap between the pair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I was more of a Windows guy I would probably buy only Microsoft-brand laptops at this point. They don’t always have the best specs, but I like their designs a lot.</p>

<p>I spend most of my computing time using Windows for work. I try to forget that I have a Lenovo laptop by putting it behind a giant monitor and using an external keyboard and trackball to operate it. Lenovo laptops are good, I guess, as long as I don’t have to touch them. I don’t like their keyboards (both in terms of layout and feel) or the pointing devices (the trackpad is too small, and I’m done with using the trackpoint/eraserhead thing). The Surface Laptops keyboards and trackpads have always seemed a lot more sensible to me in how they are designed.</p>

<h1 id="siri-reveals-apple-event-planned-for-tuesday-april-20">Siri Reveals Apple Event Planned for Tuesday, April 20</h1>

<p>I’m assuming that somebody’s job, every day, is to wake up in the morning and ask Siri “<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/13/siri-apple-event-tuesday-april-20/">When is the next Apple Event</a>?” I’m glad I didn’t try to change careers back in 2009 or 2011 (when I thought of it) and get into tech journalism.</p>

<p>I never would have predicted that in 2021 I would be using <a href="https://farmanager.com">a text-mode file manager from the 1990s</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/VladimirMarkelov/ttdl">command-line based to-do list program</a>, and, at least sometimes (by choice!), the <a href="https://www.vim.org">Vim</a> text editor.</p>

<p>Tonight I published a huge update to the website for my first iOS app: <a href="https://swiftodoapp.com">SwiftoDo</a>. What was once a one page site with a very outdated template is now a Hugo-based site full of information. There is a lot more that I could add, it is now so much better than my old site I had to publish it.</p>

<h1 id="james-hoffman-s-aeropress-video">James Hoffman’s AeroPress video</h1>

<p>Last year when I was looking for something soothing to watch on YouTube, I came across James Hoffmann’s many videos about coffee, coffee machines, coffee products, and so on. I have watched a ton of them, mostly because I like his voice and demeanor. <a href="https://youtu.be/aidvrssMSGo">His latest video</a> is about the <a href="https://aeropress.com">AeroPress</a>, which I have used for many, many years. I actually learned something new from it: People use the funnel, which is meant to help put your coffee grounds into the press without making a mess, to brew coffee into cups with mouths too small for the bottom of the AeroPress. I have to try that! He also states in the video that the AeroPress is easy to make good coffee from, but is difficult to master. I actually put very little effort into my AeroPress use—far less than I used to when I first starting using it. I have found that my AeroPress brewing technique, no matter how sloppy or lazy, doesn’t seem to affect my coffee all that much. It prefer not stressing about it anymore.</p>

<h1 id="linux-on-the-m1-mac-mini">Linux on the M1 Mac Mini</h1>

<p>The Linux kernel is <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/soc/soc.git/commit/?h=for-next&amp;id=0d5fe4b31785b732b71e764b55cda5c8d6e3bbbf">gaining Apple M1 support</a>. I have been wondering if, years from now, I can move my M1 Mac Mini to a home app-server role, running Linux, when it gets too old for Xcode and stops getting macOS updates. I have a Celeron based PC doing that for me now, but it runs hot and can be noisy, too. If a machine can run Linux, it extends its lifespan considerably for me.</p>

<h1 id="my-first-failed-attempt-to-flash-qmk-on-my-mechanical-keyboard">My (first) failed attempt to flash QMK on my mechanical keyboard</h1>

<p>I wasted an hour last night trying to install <a href="https://qmk.fm">QMK firmware</a> on my work computer’s mechanical keyboard, a <a href="https://www.durgod.com/page9?product_id=47&amp;_l=en">Durgod Taurus K320</a>. I have a love/hate relationship with it. I love that it has the best build quality, rigidity, stabilization, keycaps, and typing feel and sound of any of the many (many!) keyboards I have owned over the years. I hate that its software is buggy: so buggy that sometimes the keyboard hangs and I have to unplug it to fix it; so buggy that I have to plug it in directly to my laptop rather than through a USB hub; so buggy that that I cannot program its layers the way I want to.</p>

<p>Very recently, someone figured out how to run QMK firmware on it, which could resolve the stability and customizability problems I have with the board. Unfortunately, I was not able to figure out how to flash the firmware to the keyboard. The main problem I faced was that the keyboard was not recognized by the QMK Toolkit software (on Windows) even after I put the keyboard into bootloader mode, and even after I started messing with the bootloader firmware using <a href="https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/guides/driver_installation_zadig">Zadig</a>.</p>

<p>After lots of tries, I couldn’t figure out. I think I dodged a bullet, though, because I’m not sure QMK can control the RGB backlighting, which, on this keyboard, is necessary to see the key legends. Fortunately, despite me trying to mess with it, my keyboard still works as well as it did before. It’s not perfect, and I really would like to create a more robust <code>Fn</code> (function key) layer, but I will live with it for now.</p>

<p>🎵 I’m listening to <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/for-her/1499733036?i=1499733045"><em>Gaslighter</em> by The Chicks</a> again today. It is one of my favorite albums of 2020. Everything is great about it, from the catchy choruses to the close harmonies to the clean production. My favorite part of it is the songwriting, which is fueled with righteous anger and makes for compelling country-pop music.</p>

<p>Today I made the mistake to look up someone I knew while I was in high school. I was reading an article about illegal drugs, and thought about a high school friend’s younger brother who ran into some drug problems about 20 years ago. Sadly, I discovered that he died last year. I can only conjecture, but it seems, based on what else happened to him over the past few years, that drug problems led to his premature death. Learning about what happened to him made me very sad.</p>

<h1 id="apple-arcade-just-got-a-huge-update-of-new-games-including-some-mobile-classics">Apple Arcade just got a huge update of new games, including some mobile classics</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362388/apple-arcade-game-subscription-update-monument-valley-threes-iphone-ipad">As reported by Andrew Webster in <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple’s gaming subscription service just got a massive influx of new titles. The headliner is Fantasian — the latest release from the creator of Final Fantasy — which is joined by other titles like new versions of NBA 2K and The Oregon Trail, and World of Demons from PlatinumGames. As part of the update, the service is getting two new categories of games: Apple calls them “Timeless Classics” and “App Store Greats.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I literally just canceled my (second) Apple Arcade free trial twelve hours before this announcement. I just can’t seem to get into Apple Arcade at all. For the most part, the reason is that I find my iPhone 12 mini to be too small to be a compelling gaming device. Secondarily, I don’t want to get into a complex, involved game on my iPhone or iPad. I prefer my mobile games to be simple things that can be jumped into and out of, more like the “Timeless Classics” that Apple is now adding to Apple Arcade. It’s too bad for Apple Arcade that I already own almost all of those games.</p>

<h1 id="fully-vaccinated-people-may-travel-cdc-says">Fully vaccinated people may travel, CDC says</h1>

<p>As reported by Lena H. Sun and Lori Aratani in <em>The Washington Post</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Federal health officials gave the green light Friday for fully vaccinated people to resume travel as an estimated 100 million Americans have had at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine, and evidence mounts of the shots’ effectiveness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s good news, but it doesn’t make me want to go out and travel by plane or train anytime soon.</p>

<p>I am fully vaccinated, but my kids are not (because, of course, there is no approved vaccine for children yet), and that dramatically limits my desire to travel, eat in indoor restaurants, or do any indoor activities in public unless they are absolutely necessary. I understand that it is probably quite safe for me to do some of these activities (provided I wear a mask, etc.), but it seems to me that doing so would still be (even more) uncomfortable and unpleasant (than it was before).</p>

<p>My wife and I have been talking every day about what is OK or not OK for us to do now that we are vaccinated. Despite both being vaccinated, we are still not comfortable dining in restaurants or staying in hotels (don’t even talk about flying!), but we have realized that we are way behind our friends and acquaintances in terms of risk taking. We remain concerned about our children being explored to the virus, and about the rising and “extremely high” (per <em>The New York Times</em>) COVID-19 risk level our county is currently at. It just doesn’t make sense for us to change our behavior that much yet—at least not until the local COVID infection numbers go down quite a bit, which won’t happen until after a lot more people get vaccinated.</p>

<p>⚾️ For the first time in over a year I have a baseball game on in the background as I work. I hope to get by the with MLB “free game of the day” offering this year, rather than paying to subscribe to the season package. There was no free game for the season opener yesterday, though, so I’m watching a spring training game.</p>

<h1 id="openai-s-text-generating-system-gpt-3-is-now-spewing-out-4-5-billion-words-a-day">OpenAI’s text-generating system GPT-3 is now spewing out 4.5 billion words a day</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356180/openai-gpt-3-text-generation-words-day">James Vincent reports in <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best-known AI text-generator is OpenAI’s GPT-3, which the company recently announced is now being used in more than 300 different apps, by “tens of thousands” of developers, and producing 4.5 billion words per day. That’s a lot of robot verbiage. This may be an arbitrary milestone for OpenAI to celebrate, but it’s also a useful indicator of the growing scale, impact, and commercial potential of AI text generation.</p>

<p>The obvious industry target for auto-text is journalism. It is already being used there for sports reporting, and could probably be used for local government reporting too. There are other areas it will encroach on that are news-adjacent (think financial news or business book digest services like Blinkist), like education and entertainment.</p>

<p>I’m an auditor, and I think that, eventually, auto-text is going to destroy about 50% of our billable hours. Auditors spend a <em>ton</em> of time writing. We document our procedures. We record our work. We summarize our findings. We write reports for our clients. Making sense of all the work, both for our own understanding and for our client’s, for the sake of writing it down, takes a lot of time. Moreover, the simple act of typing it out and, especially, hyperlinking everything together so we support our conclusions, requires a lot of manual work. Some of this work is communicative, but a lot of it (like the hyperlinking part) is mechanical. Consequently, much of it is ripe for automation.</p>

<p>I think, though, that transforming this laborious and time-consuming writing process into something auto-generated by a bot would produce a lot more <em>information</em> but a lot less <em>knowledge</em> than we had before. You gain a lot more understanding how a company, business process, or control works by writing about it than by reading about it. Why? Because writing is <em>thinking</em>. To write well is mentally strenuous. It requires you to think how you would communicate an idea to someone else, notably someone else with a different perspective and different knowledge than you have. At the end of the writing process, you should understand your subject backwards and forwards and from all sides; you could probably describe it in a number of different ways; and you will likely remember the gist of it, and specific nuances about it, for far longer than you would if you had just read about it in a report.</p>

<p>The world won’t end, and few will shed tears, when AI writes audit reports and work papers. Audits cost money, and businesses mostly don’t think they benefit from them. If it makes the auditors less knowledgeable, however, side effects will develop, and those will be long-lasting. Knowledgable auditors help make good control environments possible, which leads to more stable and more solvent companies. Decreasing the understanding of auditors could make systems and processes more unstable and less trustworthy over time. Additionally, knowledgable auditors often move to the business side and go on to manage well-controlled organizations. While the auditor-to-manager career path will likely continue, such moves would not result in the same level of management quality if the auditors don’t have to think as deeply about what they are auditing as they did before the AI text-bots took over. Neither of these side effects bodes particularly well for the people the auditors and the audited companies (and their fancy AI) serve.</p>

<h1 id="there-is-no-perfect-template-just-pick-one">There is no perfect template—just pick one</h1>

<p>I stayed up late last night drafting a new, Hugo-driven version of one of my websites. I went from having nothing at all built to having about one third of the site done in a couple hours. The result, I think, will be more plain (and maybe more ugly) than the existing site, but it will be less janky on mobile devices.</p>

<p>I sank a lot of time over the past week looking for a Hugo theme that is perfect for my needs, but I couldn’t find one. For the sake of achieving my simple goal of refreshing my tiny websites, I gave up the goal of visual perfection, and am driving forward with a theme that I think is OK that works well enough for me.</p>

<p>From my perspective, I want my site to be easier to maintain and add content. That is more important to me than having a site that looks really slick. My old websites don’t look slick anymore, anyway: No one is fooled by outdated HTML templates into thinking that my very niche apps are developed by a huge, sophisticated software corporation.</p>

<h1 id="the-organizational-rabbit-hole">The organizational rabbit hole</h1>

<p>This is a short, short version of what happened to me over the past week when I decided to get organized.</p>

<ol>
<li>Form a desire to organize my project files differently.</li>
<li>Discover the <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com">Johnny Decimal</a> system.</li>
<li>Create a taxonomy for my files in a text file.</li>
<li>Start writing PowerShell script to switch folders based on the Johnny Decimal number</li>
<li>Start writing a PowerShell script to index all the Johnny Decimal numbers in my folder tree</li>
<li>Think about working with files from the command line more often</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://midnight-commander.org">Midnight Commander</a> for a command line file manager</li>
<li>Learn a lot of Midnight Commander shortcuts and customizations</li>
<li>Learn about <a href="https://farmanager.com">Far Manager</a>, which is a lot like Midnight Commander but works much better on Windows</li>
<li>Run into keyboard shortcut conflicts with Windows Terminal</li>
<li>Learn about assigning and removing keyboard shortcuts in Windows Terminal</li>
<li>Start thinking about using <a href="http://todotxt.org">todo.txt</a> from the Windows Terminal, because my <a href="https://www.taskpaper.com">TaskPaper</a> file has been too big for months and is awful to work with</li>
<li>Tried to find a todo.txt command line app for Windows that works on my machine</li>
<li>Thought about writing my own todo.txt command line app using an old C# library I created</li>
</ol>

<p>And&hellip;I still haven’t organized anything yet. 😅</p>

<h1 id="the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier">The Falcon and the Winter Soldier 📺</h1>

<p>I watched episode one of <a href="https://www.marvel.com/tv-shows/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier/1"><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a> this week. It’s a show about two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe">MCU</a> characters I don’t particularly care that much about, so it wasn’t something I was really looking forward to, but I pay for Disney+ anyway and thought I may as well check it out. Reader, I liked it!</p>

<p>My first impression is that it looks like it cost a zillion dollars. Special-effects-wise, it looks on par with the Marvel movies. Based on that alone, I could see why Disney originally wanted it to premiere first, before <em>WandaVision</em> and whatever other Marvel shows are being developed.</p>

<p>My second impression is that I appreciated that it was trying to tell a Black story as well as a super hero story. I am not optimistic that Sam’s (The Falcon’s) family side story is going to be anything but predictable, but it is nice to see an attempt to give the character some grounding in reality. Race is an issue that touches everything in American life, unfortunately. In some ways, it would be disrespectful to Sam’s character and to the audience not to address that in some way.</p>

<p>I don’t have anything bad to say about the Winter Soldier part of the show, but it isn’t as interesting to me. I expect it to follow a predictable “antihero almost, but doesn’t quite, make good” formula, but maybe the writers will surprise me.</p>

<p>Predictability aside, I’m just glad to have something new and fun to watch.</p>

<h1 id="the-menu-key">The menu key</h1>

<p>I was thinking about creating a training presentation to help my coworkers with keyboards shortcuts, but was dismayed to see that our Lenovo laptop keyboards (which I never use, because I work from home and use external peripherals) don’t even have a menu key. Someone decided that <code>Print Screen</code> was more important, which may even be true, but it doesn’t help me make a good presentation for my coworkers. The menu key alternative, <code>Shift+F10</code> is going to be a very hard sell, especially because <code>F10</code> on the laptop requires the <code>Fn</code> key to be pressed, too.</p>

<p>I have gone from someone who did not use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_key">menu key</a> on my keyboard for 20+ years (since it was invented in the 1990s) to someone who can’t live without it (on my Windows at least). I made it a point to start using it a few months ago, and now I use it constantly. I recommend that all Windows users with an ANSI or ISO keyboard layout check it out. That key is positioned right underneath your thumb when you use the arrow keys.</p>

<p>🎵 “<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/canadas-country/pl.f2da318b2e1a4f358f10efc2021cba6e">Canada’s Country</a>”: I’ve been enjoying this laid-back playlist while I work. Honestly, I didn’t know Canada made country music. Unfortunately, there’s nothing particularly <em>Canadian</em> about it. It would be cool if there were.</p>

<p>People on LinkedIn still use a lot of #hashtags non-ironically. Who are they tagging content for?</p>

<h1 id="zach-snyder-s-justice-league">Zach Snyder’s <em>Justice League</em></h1>

<p>I was not I initially interested at all in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Snyder%27s_Justice_League">Snyder Cut of <em>Justice League</em></a> but I ended up watching it anyway, over two nights. I’m glad I did.</p>

<p>I thought the theatrical release of <em>Justice League</em> was pretty bad, but not quite as bad as the professional movie review consensus was. I figured that the Snyder cut must be better, but I was surprised at how much better it is. Granted, it still isn’t <em>good</em>. It doesn’t fix its pacing problems. It still is not as brisk and pleasurable as the best of the Marvel movies. It doesn’t tell a cohesive story, but it also crams in too many story lines for a non-DC fan to keep track of. It still has some dumb script problems, such every single part of the nonsensical museum height/terrorist bombing blot in the opening Wonder Woman scene, that could have been solved by editing a few sentences of dialog. While not exactly <em>good</em>, it is a good bad movie now. Its reach often exceeds its grasp, but it offers a lot of interesting material to people who are already fans. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to be the kind of movie that would bring a lot new fans in.</p>

<p>It is now very clear to me that Zach Snyder’s vision was dark and wild and weird—definitely too much of all of those things to launch a successful franchise—but Joss Whedon’s contributions were just awful: tasteless, asinine, nonsensical, and insulting to the audience. Whedon’s dialog (notably Superman’s and The Flash’s) and the character moments he created, like the race between The Flash and Superman, are embarrassing to watch and make the characters seem stupid. Snyder’s cut simply had better dialog for them. Simply getting rid of the random <em>people</em> that Whedon put into that nuclear wasteland Russian city—the one that existed in the movie only to be destroyed in a bout of cinematic excess—made the climax bearable. Who needs to worry about a family who shouldn’t be living in a nuclear wasteland anyway when the entire world is already at stake? Whedon really did screw up that movie.</p>

<p>I think that the Snyder Cut works very well for fans of the comics, especially fans of the “what-if” versions of all the famous characters. Some fans, like me, believe that comic book characters are archetypes, and really can be <em>anything</em>, and no representation of them is truly canonical. The grim, dark version of the Justice League is an interesting thought experiment, one of many worth exploring. It is not something I ever felt hung up on as “not the real version” of Superman or whatever. The Snyder Cut isn’t the real version of the DC Universe to me, because nothing is. It’s all just ideas and entertainment anyway.</p>

<h1 id="alt-f4">Alt+F4</h1>

<p>I have been using <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com">AutoHotKey</a> for many years, and I never thought until today to map <code>Windows+Q</code> to quit the active app and close the active window. That creates something very similar to Mac’s <code>Command+Q</code> shortcut to Windows.</p>

<p>The default Windows keyboard shortcut for quitting an app is <code>Alt+F4</code>, which is a two hand operation for me. Note that in AutoHotKey, you don’t even need to send that key command; you can use the WinClose function instead:</p>

<p>#q::
WinClose, A
Return</p>

<p>One of the best things Apple has ever done with their support of keyboard shortcuts was to pretend that function keys (<code>F1</code> through <code>F12</code>) don’t exist.</p>

<h1 id="intel-invests-20-billion-into-new-factories-will-produce-chips-for-other-companies">Intel invests $20 billion into new factories, will produce chips for other companies</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing">Chiam Gartenberg reports in <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the company’s “Engineering the Future” announcement today, Gelsinger announced plans to outsource more of Intel’s chip production to third-party foundries; a $20 billion investment into two new fabs in Arizona; and a new branch of the company called Intel Foundry Services, which will see Intel’s foundries produce chips for other companies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intel has had an awful decade, having missed out on smartphone chips and having stalled out at their 14nm process for years. Still, it is a strategically important company for my country, and I have to ill will toward it, even if I don’t prefer their products right now. I would love to see them become competitive again.</p>

<p>The idea of Intel fabbing chips for other companies is a big deal. Intel has never done that before. It seems to me like it could be the first step of spinning off that part of the business into its own company, and focusing on process shrinks in ways that the fully integrated Intel could not before.</p>

<h1 id="seven-mass-shootings-in-seven-days">Seven mass shootings in seven days</h1>

<p>Josh Berlinger of <em>CNN</em> reports today that <a href="http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_d3f4ea80ea0d81acb5d30fcf939c3243">the Colorado attack is the 7th mass shooting in 7 days in the US</a>.</p>

<p>It seemed like there were periods in recent years in which we had a deadly mass shooting in the national news at least every week, if not several times each week. There has been something of a pause due to COVID, for understandable reasons. Unfortunately, we seem to be un-pausing now. Sadly, mass shooting rates in the U.S. seem to be getting back to normal.</p>

<p>But what is “normal?” It is actually hard to know what is normal for gun violence in the U.S. Here’s an interesting factoid from the article about my country’s gun problem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear how this number of mass shootings compares to an average week in the US.</p>

<p>Though some official gun violence data is available, the US federal government does not have a centralized system or database to track firearm incidents and mass shootings nationwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks some gun violence data, nearly 40,000 people were killed in incidents involving firearms in 2019.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article omits the reason for this: There are actually <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-government-study-gun-violence/story?id=50300379">laws against government agencies, such as the CDC, accurately tracking gun violence</a>. That’s just stupid and self-defeating. While dying due to gun violence is incredibly unlikely, statistically speaking, it is also completely unnecessary. We should treat <a href="https://usafacts.org/data/topics/security-safety/crime-and-justice/firearms/firearm-deaths/">all gun deaths</a> as <em>preventable</em> and <em>unacceptable</em>. Only then can we have the mental and moral clarity to do something about it.</p>

<h1 id="ulysses-and-micro-blog">Ulysses and Micro.blog</h1>

<p>It is amazing that <a href="https://blog.ulysses.app/ulysses-22/">Ulysses supports posting to Micro.blog now</a>. I love the functionality, and its inclusion definitely cements Ulysses as my only writing app on iOS and macOS at this point.</p>

<p>Now let’s bug the Ulysses team to do some other cool things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Implement publishing workflows, by which publishing a sheet can automatically trigger the sheet to be tagged with a keyword, be moved to a particular folder (such as “published”), or call an iOS Shortcut.</li>
<li>Make every command accessible via a hardware keyboard shortcut. (I’m thinking mainly of the iPad version.)</li>
<li>Add a command palette, like Visual Studio Code and Sublime Text have.</li>
<li>Support <a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/">Mermaid</a>, a text-based markup language for creating flowcharts, in fenced code blocks, like <a href="https://typora.io">Typora</a> does.</li>

<h1 id="cdc-says-schools-can-now-space-students-3-feet-apart-rather-than-6">CDC Says Schools Can Now Space Students 3 Feet Apart, Rather Than 6</h1>

<p><a href="https://text.npr.org/978608714">As Anya Kamenetz, Cory Turner, and Allison Aubrey report on the <em>NPR</em> website today</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its guidance for schools. On Friday, the agency announced it &ldquo;now recommends that, with universal masking, students should maintain a distance of at least 3 feet in classroom settings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Previously the guidance stated, &ldquo;Physical distancing (at least 6 feet) should be maximized to the greatest extent possible.&rdquo; The new guidelines still call for 6 feet of distance between adults and students as well as in common areas, such as auditoriums, and when masks are off, such as while eating. And the 6-foot distancing rule still applies for the general public in settings such as grocery stores.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This news is causing a good deal of consternation in my family. COVID cases are going up in our local schools right now. There has been an extremely high risk level in the community for several weeks, and in-person instruction is expanding anyway. Our school systems have been flatly stating that they will open even though they cannot conform with some of the requirements. This change in CDC requirements makes it easier for them to comply.</p>

<p>I think the changing of, and complexity in, the distancing rules makes them seem suspect and less likely to be followed at all. This concern is counterbalanced, however, by my belief that distancing helps very little in the classroom, because every classroom I have seen has poor ventilation. My wife and I are keeping our kids remote until the end of the school year. We are still hopeful enough to consider September as the right time to send them back to in-person learning.</p>

<p>🎵 I’m currently listening to <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/chemtrails-over-the-country-club/1545567745"><em>Chemtrails over the Country Club</em></a> by Lana Del Ray for the first time. I have been waiting for this one. Lana Del Ray is one of my favorite artists. It’s too soon for me to tell how much I like it.</p>

<h1 id="friday-is-time-for-inbox-zero">Friday is time for Inbox Zero</h1>

<p>I have been an <a href="http://www.43folders.com/43-folders-series-inbox-zero">Inbox Zero</a> guy since the early 2000s. Now I can’t keep up with my email; it comes in too fast, and I actually have work to do that demands my attention. Consequently, my Inbox is almost never empty.</p>

<p>Now, mostly on Fridays, I just select all my Inbox emails (<code>Ctrl-A</code>) and move them to my Archive folder (<code>Ctrl-Shift-1</code> thanks to an <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/automate-common-or-repetitive-tasks-with-quick-steps-b184f89f-3738-4562-96de-c0244ea830f2">Outlook Quick Step</a> I created), whether I have processed them or not. The emails aren’t deleted, they are just out of my Inbox, and that’s good enough.</p>

<p>I am investing some time trying to see if I could implement a <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com">Johnny Decimal</a> system for my files at work. Some of the constraints are tricky to deal with, but the general idea of it dovetails into what I have been doing for organization, and takes it one or two steps further.</p>

<h1 id="apple-s-new-ipad-pro-leaks-ahead-of-rumored-event">Apple&rsquo;s new iPad Pro leaks ahead of rumored event</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-new-ipad-pro-leaks-ahead-of-rumored-event/">Corinne Reichert and Stephen Shankland report in <em>CNET</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple will launch a series of new iPads in April, a report Wednesday said. The new iPad Pros will come with Apple&rsquo;s homemade M1 chips, a Thunderbolt port, and better cameras and screens, according to Bloomberg. They will reportedly come in 11- and 12.9-inch display sizes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s cool. Maybe I’m not a “Pro” but the iPad Air 4 is just about perfect for me. From my layman’s perspective, the A14-based chip in the iPad Air 4 is very similar to the M1, minus some of the cores. The 2020 iPad Pro’s chip (an A12Z) is a generation or two behind that, though it has more cores than the A14 does. Apple obviously needs to remedy that to help justify the iPad Pro’s greater price.</p>

<p>I am thinking that the “Thunderbolt” port is merely following the direction that everything with a USB-C connector is going in: USB 4 compatibility. That, plus more processor cores, sounds good for videographers, podcasters, photographers, and (I guess) gamers. Unfortunately, if Apple doesn’t fix some problems with the Files app (just try transferring a gigabyte-sized file off your iPad to a network share—I’ll wait&hellip;for it to fail), these performance boosts will be hamstrung.</p>

<h1 id="effective-presentations">Effective Presentations</h1>

<p>When it comes to creating effective PowerPoint presentations for work, my reach still exceeds my grasp.</p>

<p>I know a lot of important concepts, including the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>The slide deck is a visual aid, <em>not</em> the presentation</li>
<li>Focus on one idea per slide</li>
<li>Focus on very few visual elements/focus points per slide (e.g., five or six, maximum)</li>
<li>Light text on a dark background is easier on the eye</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, when I try to apply those ideas, I feel like I’m not getting anywhere. All of my slides look completely conventional: no better than those I created many years ago. I think they are effective, but they are ugly and boring. It does not help that I have to present on topics that are dry and technical in nature. I also feel hamstrung by my company’s PowerPoint template, which is quite busy, focuses attention on the wrong areas of the slide (i.e., the title and the footer), and has (almost completely) black text on a white background.</p>

<p>I think I need to invent a visual style that I can get away with on at least some of my slides:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full-bleed images that cover the entire slide, and obviate the need for titles or footers on my slides.</li>
<li>Text boxes that float over the images, or captions that fill in the top title area that is already part of our PowerPoint template.</li>
</ul>

<p>I just hope, if I do these things, my slides won’t end up looking like tired internet memes.</p>

<h1 id="apple-discontinues-original-homepod-will-focus-on-mini">Apple discontinues original HomePod, will focus on mini</h1>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-will-focus-on-mini/">Matthew Panzarino of <em>TechCrunch</em> reports</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple has discontinued its original HomePod after four years. It says that it will continue to produce and focus on the HomePod mini, introduced last year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I, like many audiophiles, passed on the original HomePod due to its high price and lack of connectivity. I’m sure I would have enjoyed how it sounded, and its size is just right for me, but I would likely have had to buy two of them to be fully satisfied (stereo separation is important to me). At $349 each, that was too expensive.</p>

<p>The smaller, cheaper HomePod mini holds little appeal to me, and seems to be a far less interesting product for the audio engineers at Apple to work on. For all I know, though, it sells in huge numbers, which makes it interesting in and of itself. Maybe a HomePod mini max (ha!) will be released someday, at around $150, which will hit the price/performance sweet spot I am looking for.</p>

<h1 id="the-covid-versary">The COVID-versary</h1>

<p>I guess, based on the occurrence of a President Biden speech, that this week marks <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/Voices/2021/03/12/Joe-Biden-COVID-19-anniversary-speech-full-text/8161615555448/">the one-year anniversary of COVID-19 in the United States</a>. To me, the baleful presence of COVID-19 has been around for what feels like much, much longer—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic">so long that I can’t even remember it clearly</a>.</p>

<p>My COVID panic started in early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_January_2020">January</a>, when we thought the disease was only in Wuhan. In America, for a couple weeks at least, it still seemed likely that the disease would never leave China, much like H1N1 and SARS never made a big impact here. For almost three months my mental state caromed between what I think of now as irrational fear and rational fear. I could see the whole year of 2020 play out in my imagination, way before my friends and family could see what was coming, but I could do nothing to stop it, and I could do almost nothing to protect my family from it. All those feelings felt very real and very debilitating, even when almost no one else around me was feeling them.</p>

<p>I had about two months of angst about COVID before it actually hit around here. The last time I went out with friends and family was, I think, on March 14, 2020. We went to see a musical and when out to eat at a crowded restaurant afterward. It was really hard for me to feel comfortable the entire time, but I didn’t want to let everybody down because I was concerned about a pandemic that hadn’t hit our area yet. Less than a week later, my entire family was on lockdown.</p>

<p>Back in January, February, and early March 2020, it didn’t help me at all to have known about the scope and length and shape of prior pandemics, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu">Spanish Flu</a>, which I know, from reading family letters, killed a bunch of people in my extended family about a hundred years ago. It didn’t help me at all to know what I should do and buy to prepare for it. It didn’t help me at all that I am smart enough to think for myself and to scrutinize, with a pretty good understanding of the relevant science and statistics, the information and advice experts were providing to us. All of these things just made me feel more uncertain and more cynical about what was going on.</p>

<p>A year later, I am feeling more hopeful. I have the vaccine after all, and am probably (but not definitely) immune to COVID 18. But my <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/monmouth-new-jersey-covid-cases.html">county is still at extremely high risk level</a>. The numbers are still higher than they were last year when all of us were in a panic. Despite that, all the states, even blue states like mine, are reopening rapidly and throwing caution to the wind, when it would be more prudent to do so more gradually. It makes me nervous that we are giving the virus a chance to circulate long enough to adapt resistance to our vaccines.</p>

<p>I was early in being scared of COVID, and I may be late in getting over that fear. I just hope that, when I look forward from today, whatever fear I feel is merely anxiety over things that will not play out, rather than the accurate foresight into the future that I had late last winter.</p>

<p>There was <a href="https://www.nj.com/news/2021/03/large-lakewood-brush-fire-closes-portion-of-gsp.html">a brush fire yesterday not too far from where I live</a>. Brush fires are incredibly rare where I live, so this is a curiosity to me. We have had dry, windy weather for about two weeks now, which makes wildfire conditions rife. My family was outside yesterday but fortunately we didn’t notice it; we must have been upwind.</p>

<p>I’m probably being a climate-change alarmist right now, but I think we have never had such frequent windstorms in New Jersey as we have had this winter.</p>

<p>I am grateful that the weather has changed from snowy and blustery to warm and calm. I have been able to take a walk after my lunch break for two days in a row. It feels nice.</p>

<h1 id="this-is-the-reality-of-black-girls-inauguration-poet-says-she-was-tailed-by-guard">&lsquo;This Is The Reality Of Black Girls&rsquo;: Inauguration Poet Says She Was Tailed By Guard</h1>

<p><a href="https://text.npr.org/974362036">Matthew S. Schwartz reports for NPR</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To millions of people around the world, the young poet Amanda Gorman represents hope, change and the promise of a better America.</p>

<p>But to a security guard on Friday night, the young African American woman represented a potential threat to public safety.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a sad story. My first thought was that Amanda Gorman could legitimately have been harmed in a situation like this. Then I thought, she should have a bodyguard or an entourage with her at all times for protection. <em>Then</em> I thought, she should not need to! That could ruin her life.</p>

<p>Amanda Gorman is a strong and bold speaker, and deserves the last word on the matter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In a sense, he was right,&rdquo; the former National Youth Poet Laureate added. &ldquo;I AM A THREAT: a threat to injustice, to inequality, to ignorance. Anyone who speaks the truth and walks with hope is an obvious and fatal danger to the powers that be.&rdquo;</p>

<h1 id="mermaid-for-flowcharts">Mermaid 🧜‍♀️ for flowcharts</h1>

<p>Tonight I learned about <a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/">Mermaid</a>, which is a plaintext markup language and renderer for creating flowcharts and other kinds of diagrams.</p>

<p>I want to make flowcharts quickly for my technical projects at work, but i don’t have Visio, and I hate fiddling with a GUI to line up shapes and worry about arrow lengths and so on. The way my mind works, I just want to type out what I want and have software figure out how to lay it out for me. I don’t care that much how it looks, as long as it is simple and makes sense.</p>

<p>Mermaid’s plaintext premise is really cool, and the syntax is flexible enough to not be awful. It is way more flexible than the examples on The Mermaid website originally led me to believe. You can name each shape whatever you like (not just single letter identifiers) and you can define the content (shapes) and relationships (arrows) separately if you want to. The only thing that stinks is that you have to manually insert html break tags (<code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>) for line breaks, because there is no word wrap.</p>

<p>I still need to figure out what the best renderer is for me.

<p>Ulysses invited me back into their beta testing program, and now I can test direct publishing to Micro.blog!</p>

<p>I realized today that part of my job is writing a short, really boring book about how I do my job. That, indeed, is the life of an auditor.</p>

<h1 id="gen-lock">Gen: Lock</h1>

<p>I watched “<a href="https://roosterteeth.com/series/gen-lock">Gen:lock</a>” over the past week. I was disappointed that it introduced a premise-breaking plot development in the penultimate episode. My beef is 100% spoiler-y.</p>

<p>The shows is a <a href="https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/tags/mecha">mecha anime</a>. Its premise is that, in some future war in which big robots piloted by people fight each other, a new type of mech is developed that is remotely controlled by very rare, very special kind of person. That person must bind her mind to the mech through a lot of hand-wavey technology called gen:lock.</p>

<p>The problem is, we learn three things in the final two episodes of season 1 that make the pilots unnecessary:</p>

<ol>
<li>A person’s mind can uploaded to, and downloaded from, a digital brain</li>
<li>A digital brain can be copied an indefinite number of times.</li>
<li>A digital brain is all that is needed to drive a mech</li>
</ol>

<p>If one pilot’s mind can be copied, without harming her, and then bound to any number of mechs, then why do we need the pilots at all, once you’ve got the first one’s mind copied? If the pilots aren’t really necessary, why haven’t the characters in charge of the gen:lock program figured that out yet?</p>

<p>I’m not sure I will pick it up again when season 2 comes out. Maybe this kind of anime isn’t for me.</p>

<h1 id="neera-tanden-is-biden-s-first-cabinet-level-nominee-to-withdraw">Neera Tanden is Biden’s first Cabinet-level nominee to withdraw</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/3/2/22310271/neera-tanden-biden-omb-withdraws">Ella Nilson at vox.com reports</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But much of Tanden’s résumé was overshadowed by her proliferous online posting — at least 1,000 tweets raking both Republicans and leftist Democrats over the coals — that Tanden quietly started deleting in November 2020.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven’t been following this story, but my interest was piqued when I learned that Neera Tanden’s nomination chances were in jeopardy because of her tweets from the past. People keep getting in trouble for what they post to Twitter. (“Social media” in these cases always is Twitter, too. That is probably just because it is public facing, though it is also a popular place for broadcasting, calling out, and grandstanding.)</p>

<p>It will soon be the conventional wisdom that those who seek high offices—in public service or in private industry—should have no public social media presence, no blog—certainly no Twitter account—maybe no public online presence at all. That bothers me because I think there is value in publishing one’s thoughts to the world, in a blog, vlog, podcast, or whatever other medium I can&rsquo;t even conceive of yet. People have an urge to share and should not feel that they will be punished for it, especially years after they tap the “post” button.</p>

<p>I understand that some people are deliberately awful on social media, and that <em>is</em> a problem, but isn&rsquo;t it also a problem that “the Internet never forgets?” <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">The right to be forgotten</a> is at both ridiculous to ask for and essential for people to get along with each other after a certain point. How should we evaluate a person based on what she posted online? Does it matter how long ago a thought was posted? What is fair? I think we are at a cultural crossroads regarding these questions, and may be stuck at that crossroads for a long, long time.</p>

<h1 id="trust">Trust</h1>

<p>Trust relies on three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Competence—can you do something well?</li>
<li>Benevolence—are you doing good?</li>
<li>Integrity—will you do the right thing, even when things are bad for you?</li>
</ol>

<p>I heard this breakdown on a podcast episode earlier this week, and loved the idea so much that I hastily dictated a note to Siri about it (I was in my car at the time), but I can’t recall which podcast I heard it on or who said it. I found an analogous summary of the idea on the Wiley Online Library site, in an abstract about a chapter of the book <em><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119206422.ch21">Handbook of Principles of Organizational Behavior: Indispensable Knowledge for Evidence‐Based Management, Second Edition</a></em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This chapter focuses on using the concepts of ability, benevolence, and integrity as a means of increasing trust. Ability, benevolence, and integrity are the most critical facets of trustworthiness. They foster a sense of trust in the leader by followers. Ability reflects the knowledge, skills, and aptitudes of a leader, in both technical areas and general management competencies. Benevolence and integrity are aspects of the leader&rsquo;s character, and require more time and attention on the part of followers before they can be reliably judged. In order to increase trust, leaders need to take steps to increase their ability, build their benevolence, and demonstrate their integrity. Leaders can do so on a follower‐by‐follower basis, but can also take steps to create a culture of trustworthiness within their organizations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Breaking down concepts like “trust”—which seem innately understood and obvious—into component parts can be very powerful. It gives you a way “in” when it comes to solving problems dependent on that concept.</p>

<h1 id="boston-red-sox-s-dustin-pedroia-announces-retirement-from-mlb">Boston Red Sox&rsquo;s Dustin Pedroia announces retirement from MLB</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/30816259/boston-red-sox-dustin-pedroia-announces-retirement-mlb">Joon Lee of ESPN reports</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boston Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia, who hasn&rsquo;t played since 2019 because of a knee injury suffered two seasons earlier, announced his retirement Monday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could it have ended better and I finished my career the right way? Yeah of course,&rdquo; Pedroia said on a Zoom call with the media. &ldquo;But there was a reason I was the first one dressed at 5:30 for a 7 o&rsquo;clock game. I always tell my teammates that you never know if the game is going to start early. My biggest thing in my mind was that this could be my last game and you don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s the best way I approached it from Little League on. I had the best time playing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a Red Sox fan, Pedroia’s retirement is no surprise. He hasn’t been physically able to play for years, since he got injured by a Manny Machado slide at second base. It is sad nonetheless. In his prime, he was fun and exciting to watch, and embodied the quality I enjoy seeing the most as a fan: “the love of the game.”</p>

<h1 id="nyu-researchers-find-no-evidence-of-anti-conservative-bias-on-social-media">NYU researchers find no evidence of anti-conservative bias on social media</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260269/anti-conservative-bias-social-media-no-evidence-nyu-research">Kim Lyons reports in <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The contention that social media as an industry censors conservatives is now, as we speak, becoming part of an even broader disinformation campaign from the right, that conservatives are being silenced all across American society,” the report’s lead researcher Paul Barrett said in an interview with The Verge. “This is the obvious post-Trump theme, we’re seeing it on Fox News, hearing it from Trump lieutenants, and I think it will continue indefinitely. Rather than any of this going away with Trump leaving Washington, it’s only getting more intense.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one of those studies that <em>may</em> help future historians sort through the mess we are living through now. It is pretty obvious to me that there is a conservative bias on social media rather than a liberal one. The shocking election in 2016 of a mendacious “conservative” social media gasbag is enough proof. That he wasn’t deplatformed until he lost the 2020 election, despite sowing devision and inciting violence on social media platforms, is further proof of it.</p>

<p>I bristle now at hearing or seeing the word “conservative” describe the people running a disinformation campaign against their fellow citizens. There’s nothing “conservative” about this influential and dangerous wing of the Republican Party, which is undermining the basic traditions and institutions of society. I identify strongly as a political progressive, but I am also quite conservative in how I think that people should behave publicly and how ethically and transparently political institutions should be run.</p>

<h1 id="fullmetal-alchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</h1>

<p>While I have been working a ton lately, I can’t work every second of the day. I have been watching the “Fullmetal Alchemist” anime series (there are two), mostly late at night, to unwind.</p>

<p>I watched the entirety of “Fullmetal Alchemist”—which is the first anime adaptation of the manga—first. Because it veers widely off of the plot of the manga (which, since I am not a manga reader, I don’t care about), it seems to be widely considered the lesser of the two adaptations. I think that sells it short. There are lots of sad, thought-provoking episodes, especially toward the beginning of the run, in which characters and the audience question what it means to be human, and what is the value of a human soul. These questions build up to big ideas and set pieces by the end, which is satisfying. There are some structural problems with how the story is told—mostly in the way the timeline, pacing, and character balance shift between the beginning, middle, and end of the series—but there is no problem that majorly detracts from the series as a whole. You could quibble that a lot of the theory behind how the magic system works doesn’t make any sense, which is vital to the overall theme of the series. Consider, however, that it is a <em>magic system</em>, you have to suspend disbelief quite a bit to begin with, and of course it doesn’t make perfect sense.</p>

<p>I am almost done watching the second adaptation, “Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood”, which stays true to the manga plot and is generally lauded as the better of the two anime series. At this point, I don’t think of it as “better” but it certainly is much different. The stakes in “Brotherhood” are much higher, the characters are more tightly integrated throughout the series, and the tone overall is funnier and less sad, despite the raised stakes and some (somewhat) more mature relationship elements between childhood friends/teenage-phenoms Edward and Winry. Despite these advantages, “Brotherhood” is far more cartoony in style, which I don’t prefer. It uses <em>chibi</em> (super deformed) style far more heavily than the first adaptation did, which I find distracting—the characters are often blowing their stacks in anger or are extremely embarrassed or go into some of other extreme, but emotionally and visually, that takes me out of the story a bit. That is a relatively small demerit, however, and it is offset by the increased complexity of the story.</p>

<p>I am eager to see how “Brotherhood” ends, and would recommend that everyone try watching both series, especially the first one, because it is very good despite being the less-loved one.</p>

<h1 id="little-voice">Little Voice</h1>

<p>My wife and I recently discovered the Apple TV+ show “<a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/little-voice/umc.cmc.4x932osv992wjjdq7ce12za2r">Little Voice</a>” and very much enjoy it.</p>

<p>It is different in pace and tone from other shows (like “Curb Your Enthusiasm”) that we have been watching lately. While there is a lot going on in each episode, the pace feels slow and thoughtful, as if the show is focused mainly on the growth of its characters and on illustrating (a version of) the New York City music scene. I would not recommend watching “Little Voice” for its main plot, because it appears to follow the well-worn path of “talented-but-unknown artist slowly becomes successful.” That said, there are a ton of great character moments throughout.</p>

<p>The main draw of the show is the music, most of which are songs written by series co-creator Sara Bareilles. There is a lot of music performance in each episode. All these sections look great, sound great, and are integrated completely naturally into the story. However, they serve as the primary reason why the pace is slow. If you don’t like the music, then the show will not be for you.</p>

<p>Overall, I think that “Little Voice” is under-rated. It didn’t blow up like “Ted Lasso” (which is, indeed, great) or “Central Park” (which is also great), but is my third-favorite Apple TV+ series thus far.</p>

<p>I have been super, super, super busy today, and it just won’t stop. It looks like I’ll be working a lot of overtime&hellip;like right now. At least, once the kids go to bed, I can put my headphones back on and enjoy some music while I work.</p>

<h1 id="the-business-of-influenece-with-mkbhd">The Business of Influenece with MKBHD</h1>

<p>I found this <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22231657/mkbhd-marques-brownlee-interview-youtube-creator-influencer-decoder">fairly long interview on <em>The Verge</em></a> with Marques Brownlee (<a href="https://youtube.com/c/mkbhd">MKBHD on YouTube</a>) to be very interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But what looks effortless and fun to the viewer is often the result of careful planning and investment. YouTubers are entrepreneurs, and Brownlee — my guest on today’s episode of Decoder — talks that talk with the best of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marques Brownlee could be described as “tech reviewer” or a “social media influencer” or a “YouTuber.” I don’t watch all his videos, but I have checked in with his YouTube channel periodically since I first saw him (as a college student!) on an episode of TWiT. While he is telegenic and charismatic, he also presents himself as someone with a strong sense of ethics who is very smart and thoughtful about he approaches his business. This interview gives a pretty long look into Marques Brownlee’s professional world.</p>

<p>My wife, who is a high school teacher, recently reported to me that one of the top “professions” that teens want to go into is “social media influencer.” That is kind of eyeroll-inducing to me, but I suppose it is as realistic and as meaningful an aspiration as “famous writer” was to me. It is important to know how much work goes into that sort of job, and how much time, investment, and infrastructure goes into keeping up with the competition.</p>

<p>I don’t really want to criticize <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/tweetbot-6-moves-to-subscription-pricing/">TapBots for making TweetBot version 6 a subscription app</a>. I would like to highlight that $6.99/yr is a reasonable price to pay every year if you use an app every day. I wish more annual app subscriptions were below the $9.99 level.</p>

<h1 id="the-covid-19-vaccines-are-amazing-let-s-quickly-get-them-into-people-s-arms">The Covid-19 Vaccines Are Amazing. Let’s Quickly Get Them into People’s Arms.</h1>

<p><a href="https://kottke.org/21/01/the-covid-19-vaccines-are-amazing-lets-quickly-get-them-into-peoples-arms">Jason Kottke’s blog post</a> offers some great advice that we all should heed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So what can you do about this right now? 1. Stop worrying about the variants until the experts let us know we have something to worry about. 2. If you are eligible for the vaccine, get it! 3. Spread the word about vaccine availability in your area. Yesterday Vermont opened signups for vaccination appointments for all Vermonters 75 and older, and I texted/emailed everyone I could think of who was over 75 or who had parents/relatives/friends who are over 75 to urge them to sign up or spread the word. 4. Continue to wear a mask (a better one if possible), wash your hands, social distance, stay home when possible, don’t spend time indoors w/ strangers, etc. Thanks to these remarkable vaccines, real relief is in sight — let’s keep on track and see this thing through.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My family is now obsessed with wearing two layers of masks, which I tried but couldn’t get to work with my glasses on. I am more interested in finally being able to buy and wear N95, KN95, and KN94 (my favorite) masks, which are more effective than the cloth masks and surgical masks I have been stuck with since February.</p>

<p>In New Jersey, vaccine distribution is both successful (my wife, who is a teacher, got her first dose yesterday) and a total mess (it is very hard to get an appointment, there is no central coordination of virus distribution, and any effective effort on prioritizing inoculations for higher-risk groups is effective gone). If my family is a good indicator of people’s behavior, then lots of us New Jerseyans keep hammering away at the appointment systems, trying to get a better appointment slot, which further jams up the system.</p>

<p>I wrote a support email to <a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a> last week inquiring about <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> support. I got a response that said that it was on their “immediate roadmap” which is pretty exciting and still slightly mysterious.🤞</p>

<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/11/amid-coronavirus-flu-cases-record-low/4127197001/">This article in <em>USA Today</em></a> confirms my suspicions that all the anti-COVID measures would drastically reduce the prevalence of seasonal flu in the U.S.:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the 2019 flu season from Sept. 29 to Dec. 28, the CDC reported more than 65,000 cases of influenza nationwide. During the same period last year, the agency reported 1,016 cases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get a vaccine every year for the flu—and luckily have not caught it since I was in elementary school—but other than that, I never think about it. My dream right now is that the COVID vaccine be the same kind of thing: a prick on the arm once a year, and otherwise nothing much to think about.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/barry-season-4-scripts-finished/">Per Ethan Anderton on <em>SlashFilm</em>, quoting Bill Hader:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Right when the lockdown happened in March, we were a week away from shooting. So the last time I was in a room with a lot of people was the table read episodes one and two of season three, and we were ready to go. Then it all got shut down. Season three is completely written, ready to go, and then during this time we actually went and wrote season four. So we have both of those kinda done. We’re just waiting until we can start shooting again.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Barry” is a <em> sui generis</em> example of peak TV. It takes a lot of risks in terms of both plot and tone, and so far they have all paid off. I certainly couldn’t predict how Bill Hader and Alex Berg were going to write their way out of the end of Season 2 of “Barry,” but I guess they cracked it and then some.</p>

<p>I thought the default webcam settings made me look like Emperor Palpatine, but an image search soon revealed that Emperor Palpatine looks much, much better than I do. 😂</p>

<p>I did find out how to adjust the white balance to make me look less cadaverous. However, for now at least, I’m going to apply the built-in black-and-white filter to my video stream. I wonder if that will be annoying to others, but I like the simplicity of it.</p>

<h1 id="when-american-carnage-is-the-tone-at-the-top">When “American Carnage” is the Tone at the Top</h1>

<p>I was having a pretty good day yesterday, full of minor but meaningful personal and professional accomplishments, and then all hell broke loose in Washington, DC. I pushed the news of it away as best I could, so I am less informed than I otherwise would be, but I am sad, angry, and ashamed nonetheless.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-rioters-incite/2021/01/06/0acfc778-5035-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html">Per Philip Rucker in <em>The Washington Post</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The “American carnage” that Donald Trump vowed to end at the dawn of his presidency was revived in terrifying, treacherous form at its sunset Wednesday, as Trump made a fiery last stand and incited his supporters to storm and sack the U.S. Capitol as part of an attempted coup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t even know how to comment on this event without seeming glib, but I feel compelled to say something anyway.</p>

<p>I am, by trade, an auditor. One thing auditors are trained to investigate is called “tone at the top,” which represents the values expressed by the top management of a company which are expected from everyone who reports up to them.</p>

<p>After auditing for years, I have discovered that “tone at the top” is almost everything you need to know about an organization to get an idea how well and how ethically it is operated. Ethics and decency from the top of an organization really do trickle down all the way to the bottom and permeate it entirely. Moreover, they are strongly indicative of the organization’s *solvency*—its ability to hold together as a going concern over time.</p>

<p>When the “tone at the top” is selfish, vain, petty, petulant, aggrieved, unethical, amoral, and violent—as Trump’s has been—that tone trickles down to the whole organization, and pollutes the thoughts and corrupts the actions of the people within it. Unfortunately in this case, the “organization” is not just the Executive Branch, not just the federal government, and not just the Republican Party: it is the entire United States of America. What’s more, because the U.S. is a vastly influential country, the corruption and willful deceit at the head of it spills over into the rest of the world.</p>

<p>I feel like I have known this from the beginning—before the slow-moving coup even started—because I understood what the “tone at the top” was, and knew that it was vitally important. <em>Knowing</em> this, sadly, is not enough, because in a democracy a majority of people need to know this for things to turn out better. Being <em>able</em> to know this, like being able to discern the “tone at the top” as a new auditor, is a rare gift. It requires a trait that is not easily acquired, but is so difficult to teach and to learn that it is often considered to be innate: <em>shrewdness</em>.</p>

<p>That’s because “tone at the top” isn’t always as blatantly obvious as Trump’s vitriolic tweets and shambolic rally speeches. Understanding what the “tone at the top” <em>really</em> is, it requires a combination of healthy skepticism, decent powers of observation, and the knowledge of how things are supposed to work. You have to understand both context <em>and</em> subtext; subtext is much harder to grasp than context, but is often the more important to the two. You have to interpret people’s words <em>and</em> actions, and compare them to each other to see if the actions follow the words. You also have to have some kind of ethical foundation—which may be laws of the state, societal norms, or virtue ethics— on which to base your conclusions.</p>

<p>The human mind has evolved to do a lot of this analysis automatically. Consider that establishing whether you trust another person is, and always has been, an essential part of human interaction. But, like a lot of thought processes that are largely automatic, many times mental shortcuts are taken and the wrong choice is made. To be able to second-guess these automatic thought processes takes intellect, some degree of guidance, and a willingness to think a little harder.</p>

<p>I would not be surprised to learn that many of the people trying to unlawfully overturn the election—not counting the elected officials who are operating out of cynical self-interest—really do think they are making an ethical decision, and really do think they are doing the right thing. They just trusted the wrong person, or made the wrong decision about voting for or supporting, because they lack the shrewdness and imagination to discern that the “tone at the top” really does matter, and that bad words from a lazy president really will lead to riots in the streets.</p>

<p>I realized today that in, ACL, a scripting language I use at work, I have been using a mixture of <code>PascalCase</code> and <code>snake_case</code> (like this: <code>Table_Name</code>) that is the worst of both worlds in terms of typing difficulty. Fortunately, ACL is not case-sensitive.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of <a href="https://medium.com/[@kevinrose](https://micro.blog/kevinrose)/introducing-zero-a-new-app-to-help-you-fast-209935e8245d">the Zero app</a>, which is a tracker for intermittent fasting. It is free, attractive, and has just enough features to keep me engaged and motivated, and no more.</p>

<p>Currently, my favorite feature is its Apple Watch complication, which fills up a ring (similar to the Activity app’s rings) as you progress through your fasting period. I find that filling that ring every day, and the app&rsquo;s cheerful notifications every morning, really help motivate me to stop snacking or having an extra meal at night.</p>

<p>The only thing I don&rsquo;t like about it is that it requires you to set up an account with an email address. While the company behind it does not appear to be abusing my privacy in any way, I would prefer that they didn’t require an account. Perhaps they will adopt Sign in with Apple when it becomes available this fall.</p>

<h1 id="thoughts-on-apple-card">Thoughts on Apple Card</h1>

<p>I got the Apple Card about a week ago, and just started using it this weekend. Here are some initial thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li>I very much like the security and privacy features Apple Pay and the Apple Card. I try to use Apple Pay whenever I can to take advantage of most of these features, no matter what card I was using.</li>
<li>I very much like the enhancements to the Wallet app on my iPhone to review transactions and spending.</li>
<li>2% cash back on all Apple Pay purchases seems like a pretty good benefit to me.</li>
<li>3% back on Apple transactions seems a little stingy, considering that Amazon and Target offer 5% back when you use their branded cards. I would get a much better cash-back rate buying an Apple product on Amazon, using my Amazon.com Visa.</li>
<li>The interest rate offered to me was the lowest that they offer, and it is a between two and three percentage points lower than the other cards I have. I never carry a balance, so it doesn’t mean much to me.</li>
<li>I had a false-alarm fraud alert shortly after I set it up. I made it my default on my Apple account, and a $30 annual subscription fee trigged a fraud alert. I contacted Apple Card support via iMessage, and cleared up the problem.</li>
<li>Buying different things changes the color of the card in the Wallet app, which is amusing. The colors correspond to the spending charts.</li>
<li>I had a lot of trouble adding the card to my Apple Watch. It took lots of fiddling with settings, but, fortunately, I did not have to unpair and repair the Apple Watch to my iPhone.</li>
<li>The titanium card is boring and heavy. I expect to never use it. Its best feature is that my card number is not printed on it.</li>
<li>Some common features are missing: a website, integration with personal finance applications, and joint accounts (or authorized users).</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="ready-player-one-by-ernest-cline">📚 Ready Player One, by Ernest Cline</h1>

<p>Earlier this year, I completed reading _<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One">Ready Player One</a>_ by Ernest Cline. It was the first novel that I had read in a while, as I have been reading mostly nonfiction in recent years. I discovered the book from an <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/triangulation/episodes/322">episode of the “Triangulation” podcast in which Leo Laporte interviewed author Andy Weir</a>, who enthusiastically recommended the book.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed the book. The prose is efficient and the pacing is swift. I thought it started out strong, and I liked the world building and the build-up of suspense in the early chapters. After a while, though, I tired of all the 1980s video game and movie references, and wanted the book to end. While I was about three quarters through the book, I referred to it as “the reading equivalent to watching somebody else play video games”. For me, the stakes felt too low, and the characterizations were too thin, to make a lasting impression. Still, I had fun reading it, at least most of the way through.</p>

<h1 id="introducing-the-new-yorker-crossword-puzzle">Introducing The New Yorker Crossword Puzzle</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/crossword/puzzles-dept/2018/04/30">The New Yorker just launched a crossword puzzle</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of our readers have e-mail addresses now, and the Web has given us the space to try new things—and to try old things again. In that spirit, we’re launching another crossword, online this time, and in the American style. It’ll be weekly, just like the magazine: a new one every Monday morning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am a daily crossword puzzle player. I enjoy them, though I am not terribly good at them, because I love word games and have read that crosswords help keep your mind sharp into old age.</p>

<p>The New Yorker puzzle is a <em>tiny</em> bit more challenging than I would like (as I said, I’m not a strong player), but I’m happy there’s another source of crossword puzzles (beyond the New York Times, which I also subscribe to) coming may way.</p>

<p>I hope they will someday move it into their iOS app. The scrolling behavior, which affects the on-page keyboard, is annoying on mobile.</p>

<h1 id="prolific-apple-supply-chain-analyst-ming-chi-kuo-departs-kgi-securities-likely-to-focus-on-companies-other-than-apple">Prolific Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo departs KGI Securities, likely to focus on companies other than Apple</h1>

<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/30/prolific-apple-supply-chain-analyst-ming-chi-kuo-departs-kgi/">Kuo’s departure</a> comes hot off the heels of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/13/apple-memo-on-leaks-leaks/">Apple’s recent “leaked” memo</a> about leaking that threatened the leaky leaders who leak.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why has Ming-Chi Kuo, arguably one of the most popular technology analysts in the world, decided to move on? One possible reason is that his sources have done likewise, or perhaps have even been removed in light of Apple’s recent memo and strong stance against leaks — supply chain or otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wondered why myself, and figured that Apple has either threatened him, or his sources, with criminal lawsuits. I, for one, wouldn’t mind if Apple finally closed up all the leaks in its supply chain. While these leaks may benefit Apple investors, they don’t really benefit Apple fans that much.</p>

<h1 id="how-we-got-to-now">How We Got To Now</h1>

<p>I recently finished reading Steen Johnson’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/books/review/how-we-got-to-now-by-steven-johnson.html">How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World</a>. It was a breezy and pleasurable read, full of interesting information. Johnson’s writing is clear, concise, and engaging throughout.</p>

<p>As a huge nerd who spent a lot of time in childhood perusing a science and technology encyclopedia, and a lot of time in my teens watching tech-related documentaries on Discovery and TLC (before those networks drifted to reality TV), I already knew a lot of the material. Still, it’s a wonderful read to anyone who loves the “history of ideas course” way of looking at disparate, seemingly unrelated things in everyday life, and drawing a through line that connects them all. Plus I learned new phrases that describe these unintended and intended technological and cultural developments—“hummingbird effects” and “the adjacent possible”—that I particularly like.</p>

<h1 id="i-miss-caesar-salad">I miss Caesar salad</h1>

<p>It seems to me that massive outbreaks of food borne illness are becoming more and more common. That <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-outbreak-worsens-98-people-now-sick-n869681">our current, worsening outbreak</a> is the <em>second</em> E. Coli outbreak tied to my favorite type of lettuce in the past six months or so, and it is so virulent, is making me feel worried about our food system, and pessimistic about my country’s will to improve it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An outbreak of E. coli food poisoning linked to romaine lettuce has widened and has now made at least 98 people sick, federal health officials said Friday.</p>

<p>More than half have had to be hospitalized because the strain of E. coli causing this outbreak is an especially nasty one, the officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said.</p>

<p>People in 22 states have reported E. coli infections linked to the outbreak, the CDC and FDA said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m no expert in this, but I feel like we have several problems in our food system that have, in the past few decades, started to compound in dangerous ways that we should have seen coming. Some of these problems include overcrowding of animals, overuse of antibiotics in livestock, and over-concentration in production and processing. When bad hygiene infects food, it’s worse now than it used to be. The bacteria are more resistant to antibiotics, and the food, and food borne illness, is distributed all across the country.</p>

<p>Another annoyance to me, as a someone who has eaten some raw eggs (usually in cookie dough or homemade eggnog) and rare meat over the years, is that I have <em>never</em> gotten a food borne illness from those activities. I have, however, gotten terribly ill several times from eating restaurant salads, probably due to unwashed hands or vegetables. There are menu warnings about undercooked meat in every restaurant I go to, but none about the danger of eating unwashed vegetables.</p>

<p>I am impatiently awaiting the day I can eat Caesar salads again.</p>

<p>While I was on vacation, I wrote a series of blog posts about all my old speaker systems. My goal was to trace my journey from a normal person to an audiophile, as I upgrade my gear up over the years.</p>

<p>The speakers that I have had are nothing special, but they are special, in a way, to me, because of all the music I listened to through them.</p>

<p>I plan to write another, hopefully more interesting, series about my various headphones in the near future.</p>

<p>A software update at work pushed out the virtual backgrounds feature for WebEx. Since my home office—at least the part of it that is <em>behind</em> me and not under my control— is a mess, I enabled it.</p>

<p>Sadly, it looks pretty awful. The background mostly leaves a halo around me un-obscured; sometimes it clips portions of my face or shoulder off. I have a very high-end laptop and a “very good” Logitech webcam (all webcams are terrible, I think), so I have concluded that WebEx’s technology is way behind Zoom’s, which does the virtual backgrounds flawlessly. I think I will leave virtual backgrounds on, for privacy reasons, and hope no one minds the weird visual side effects.</p>

<p>I did not have to wait long for the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/">Apple Music announcement</a> to drop.</p>

<p>Apple Music can release its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439885/apple-music-tease-hi-fi-lossless-music-streaming">rumored lossless tier</a> any minute now. I’m waiting with my best headphones. I don’t care at all about spatial audio or Dolby Atmos, though, so I hope that isn’t the only kind of thing coming.</p>

<h1 id="apple-is-poised-to-lose-its-antitrust-battle">Apple is Poised to Lose its Antitrust Battle</h1>

<p>I think that Apple is going to lose whatever antitrust cases are eventually brought against it in the EU and in the US. I don’t actually think Apple <em>should</em> lose, because I don’t think it is correct to call Apple a monopoly.</p>

<p>The general antitrust argument against Apple is that its App Store platform is too locked down, and that is unfair because Apple is a monopoly (insert eye roll here) of its own platform. App is a platform owner. Of course it has a “monopoly” over the platform it owns. That doesn’t make it a monopoly in the overall marketplace. Moreover, while iOS is undoubtedly popular, it is a <em>minority</em> smartphone platform, which in the broadest legal terms that I understand, makes monopoly-related antitrust law not apply to them.</p>

<p>App developers have to accept Apple’s terms, and pay a pretty large commission to Apple, to distribute apps in the store or to take in-app purchases. That may not feel fair to developers, but I can’t take seriously the arguments that it is illegal. It is the same way that game consoles work. Will we go after Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft next? Shouldn’t they open up their game consoles to alternative payment systems and alternate app stores, too? I have heard of no one seriously arguing this.</p>

<p>The most compelling argument against Apple’s App Store requirements is that Apple demands too much money from developers for distribution and payment solutions that other companies now offer at lower prices. I am sympathetic to this argument because I too think Apple should have lowered its commission over the years, as marginal costs for these technologies and services have declined. However, the size of Apple’s cut is not really at issue here. Apple, rather clumsily, lowered its commission for a majority of its developers to 15%, starting in January 2021, but the antitrust talk just keeps rolling on.</p>

<p>The second most compelling argument against Apple is that it uses its platform-owner advantage to position its own software and services over third-party competitors. Again, I sympathize. Apple Sherlocks developers sometimes, and can position its own software and services over anyone else’s. So does Microsoft (ever use Windows?). Amazon exercises a tremendous advantage over third party sellers in its online marketplace.</p>

<p>I could argue that even Linux vendors, such as Ubuntu, position their own, preferred software over that of third-party developers. Software platform owners always have advantages over third parties that operate on their platform. Extracting as much value from that as is possible is the entire point of creating and owning a platform. I think it only becomes an antitrust problem when a company has majority market share, which Apple does not have.</p>

<p>If developers can’t accept Apple’s terms, then they shouldn’t. They should develop for Android instead, which has the majority market share anyway, or create progressive web apps. (Remember, the web is an app platform, too, not just a way to collect credit card payments for software.) If developers “need” to develop for iOS because iOS users, on average, spend way more money on apps than Android users, then that just shows the value Apple’s marketplace has, and <em>is</em> worth paying for.</p>

<p>Despite my views, I still think Apple is poised to lose any legal actions about them regarding monopoly. It won’t lose based on the merits of whatever case is brought against it; it will lose because enough political sentiment is against Apple, at least in this area, and that is all that matters. Perhaps all the tech giants will fall under this scrutiny, and all will be forced to open up their platforms more widely, and will be forced to renounce their first-party advantage when distributing applications and features. I just don’t see that actually happening, and if it does happen, I don’t think it will benefit anybody in the way government regulators would expect. It could even stifle the development of the next generation of technology platforms.</p>

<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2021/05/is-a-higher-quality-apple-music-tier-on-the-way/">I hope so.</a> I am a sucker for lossless codecs, even though I probably can’t hear the difference between them and AAC-256.</p>

<p>I have been using SQL for 25 years and I just learned today that <code>SELECT [...] FROM Table1, Table2</code> is called a “<a href="https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-basics/sql-server-cross-join/">cross join</a>” an can also be expressed as <code>SELECT [...] FROM Table1 CROSS JOIN Table2</code>. 🤦 In my defense, I must say that I have only had to use a cross join a few times in my entire career.</p>

<p>I unblocked Reddit.com earlier this week because the domain keeps coming up in tech question-related search results. After only a few days, I’m back looking at mechanical keyboards and expensive headphones on Reddit like an addict. I just blocked the domain again.</p>

<h1 id="durgod-zeus-engine-upgrade">⌨️ Durgod Zeus Engine Upgrade</h1>

<p>To my complete surprise, I discovered today that Durgod released an update to their keyboard configuration: Durgod Zeus Engine. The interface looks a lot better, and it is a little easier to use. They didn’t change the keyboard hardware driver to support function layers, which is unfortunately. I really want that. (Honestly, what I want is the ObinsKit software that powers the Anne Pro 2 to apply work on it.)</p>

<p>I set up a new RGB color scheme and remapped my CapsLock to Control, saved them to the keyboard’s local profile, and (out of habit) configured the Zeus Engine to <em>not</em> start every time I log on. I plugged my keyboard into my USB hub and will keep my fingers crossed that it will work reliably now.</p>

<p><a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/report-apples-m2-chips-may-launch-as-soon-as-july-2021">Napier Lopez reports in <em>The Next Web</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple only just released its new iMacs featuring the acclaimed M1 ARM-based processor, but according to a report from Nikkei, the company plans to launch M2 as soon as July.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know anything in particular about Apple’s plans, but it seems crazy to me to expect a faster chip at this time. What I would expect is more I/O, driven by more cores and supported by more RAM. Of course, I could be wrong. Maybe Apple can overvolt the M1 to get more speed out of it, and will call it by another name.</p>

<p>I am very conservative about cities re-opening too soon, considering the pandemic has not ended. But <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/29/new-york-city-mayor-bill-de-blasio-says-the-city-will-re-open-100percent-on-july-1.html">NYC reopening on July 1</a> almost seems reasonable to me. Time will tell.</p>

<p>🎵 I’m going to lean into my New Jersey-ness today and listen to a ton of Bruce Springsteen. First album up: <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-wild-the-innocent-the-e-street-shuffle/186149850"><em>The Wild, The Innocent, &amp; the E Street Shuffle</em></a>. This is one of Springsteen’s records that I never think to listen to, but, of course, it’s great. It was made back when Springsteen still wrote songs with a torrent of stream-of-consciousness-style lyrics like a verbose street poet.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407297/microsoft-office-new-default-font-2022">Per Tom Warren In <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is changing its default Office font next year and wants everyone to help pick the new default. While there are more than 700 font options in Word, Microsoft has commissioned five new custom fonts for Office, in a move away from the Calibri font that has been the default in Microsoft Office for nearly 15 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am unusually attached to Calibri so I am not looking forward to this change. Then again, at work I often have to publish using Arial Narrow, which I think is objectively awful in terms of aesthetics and legibility, so it probably won’t affect me too much.</p>

<h2 id="4-stars">4 Stars</h2>

<h3 id="looks-great-but-i-don-t-love-the-shape-of-the-handle">Looks great, but I don’t love the shape of the handle</h3>

<p>Overall, this bread knife is pretty good, but its straight shape provides poor knuckle clearance, which makes cutting loaves with hard bottom crusts more difficult than it should be. A curved or tapered blade is a better design.</p>

<p>The coolest thing about this knife is that it is one piece of metal from tip to handle. That is appealing to me in terms of durability, especially because I am in the middle of getting rid of a set of knives from another brand because their handles are falling apart.</p>

<p>I could not tell it from the product photos, but the shape of the handle is roughly triangular: it is slimmer at the bottom than at the top. It looks cool in photos, but it isn’t the best ergonomically for me because there is a less surface area than I am used to to grip on the bottom of the knife.</p>

<p>The blade is made of high-carbon steel, which is exactly what you want in a kitchen knife because it promises to retain sharpness for a long time.</p>

<h1 id="the-sequence">The Sequence 🎮</h1>

<p>Yesterday I decided to re-play a game I loved a few years ago called <em><a href="http://ombgames.com/?p=121">[The Sequence]</a></em>. It is a puzzle game where you, essentially, build a machine with various component parts to move a ball (well, the game calls it a “binary cell”) from one part of the screen to another. It sounds simple, and it starts out fairly simple, but it becomes very challenging as you progress. It’s the sort of game a programmer, or anyone who enjoyed <em><a href="https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine">Human Resource Machine</a></em> would enjoy.</p>

<h1 id="fez">Fez 🎮</h1>

<p>I am delighted that I discovered a video game that is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/fez-switch/">new to the Nintendo Switch</a>, but not at all new to the world, called <a href="http://www.fezgame.com">Fez</a>. This is the game’s official blurb:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gomez is a 2D creature living in a 2D world. Or is he? When the existence of a mysterious 3rd dimension is revealed to him, Gomez is sent out on a journey that will take him to the very end of time and space. Use your ability to navigate 3D structures from 4 distinct classic 2D perspectives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is a 2D puzzle platformer where your character can rotate the environment left or right 90 degrees at a time, but you always interact with the environment in two dimensions. Some of the puzzles are quite challenging, but I think that the most hidden secrets that you can get from solving the hardest puzzles are all optional to completing the game. It’s a charming game, and easily my favorite Switch game of this year so far.</p>

<h1 id="the-shooting-likely-lasted-one-or-two-minutes">The shooting likely lasted one or two minutes.</h1>

<p>I am unsettled today by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/16/us/indianapolis-fedex-shooting#the-attack-is-the-latest-in-a-recent-series-of-mass-shootings-in-the-us">yet another mass shooting</a> in my country. It seems like not a day goes by without a <em>New York Times</em> news alert about it. (I plan to turn those alerts off after I finish writing this.) This time, a gunman killed seven people, then himself. This detail about the story jumped out at me: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/16/us/indianapolis-fedex-shooting#shooting-at-a-fedex-warehouse-in-indianapolis-leaves-8-dead">The shooting likely lasted one or two minutes</a>.”</p>

<p>I think the news media covers mass shootings like they are exciting, like some kind of action movie where bad outcomes only happen to the extras, and the rest of us get to watch. But “one or two minutes” isn’t an action movie. It isn’t something exciting. It’s actually, really, really stupid. That such a thing is even possible, outside a war, is embarrassing and shameful to all of us. I wish it were more widely considered to be.</p>

<h1 id="iphone-13-mini-could-be-the-last-mini-iphone-says-kuo">iPhone 13 mini could be the last &lsquo;mini&rsquo; iPhone, says Kuo</h1>

<p>Stephen Warwick reports in <em>iMore</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kuo says that next year Apple will drop the 5.4-inch model and run with two 6.1-inch models instead, one Pro, one regular.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This rumor is a prime reason I upgraded to the iPhone 12 mini early this year. I absolutely love the size and weight of it. It fits better in my hands and in my pockets than my iPhone 7 Plus ever did. However, the 12 mini’s small screen size makes it less compelling to read on, edit photos on, or watch videos on. These are all things I do pretty much every day without complaint, but if it were going to be my only portable device I would have bought one with a bigger screen.</p>

<p>I have no desire to go back to a larger phone, because the phone, for me, is one tool among many, rather than the center of my computing universe. It doesn’t have to be compelling, just useful. It doesn’t have to be used constantly, just when it makes the most sense to.</p>

<p>Some time from now, I think the smartphone, as a thing I carry around all the time, and as the default “Internet communication device,” is going to disappear and be replaced by something else: smart glasses maybe, or some kind of earpiece (when I am really old and need hearing aides).</p>

<h1 id="my-first-nuget-package">My First NuGet Package</h1>

<p>Last night, I published my first <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/what-is-nuget">NuGet</a> package: <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/TodoTxt.Library/1.0.0">TodoTxt.Library</a>. It is a code library meant to help develop <a href="http://todotxt.org">todo.txt</a> applications in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">.NET</a>.</p>

<p>I wrote the code back in 2015, <a href="https://github.com/mjdescy/TodoTxt.Library">open-sourced it on GitHub</a>, but otherwise left it alone because I had moved on to more macOS and iOS development by that time. This week, I upgraded the code base work on .NET 5, so that it is cross platform (rather than Windows-only, as was my original version), and figured out how to package it and upload it to NuGet, where it may have a shot at actually being used.</p>

<h1 id="microsoft-announces-surface-laptop-4-with-choice-of-intel-or-amd-processors">Microsoft announces Surface Laptop 4 with choice of Intel or AMD processors</h1>

<p>Tom Warren’s article on <em>The Verge</em> caught my eye:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is refreshing its Surface lineup with the Surface Laptop 4 today, which now offers the choice between AMD or Intel processors across both the 13.5- and 15-inch models. Both sizes will ship with Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors or AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series processors. Microsoft is shipping its Surface Laptop 4 on April 15th in the US, Canada, and Japan, starting at $999 for the AMD model and $1,299 for the Intel version — a $300 price gap between the pair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I was more of a Windows guy I would probably buy only Microsoft-brand laptops at this point. They don’t always have the best specs, but I like their designs a lot.</p>

<p>I spend most of my computing time using Windows for work. I try to forget that I have a Lenovo laptop by putting it behind a giant monitor and using an external keyboard and trackball to operate it. Lenovo laptops are good, I guess, as long as I don’t have to touch them. I don’t like their keyboards (both in terms of layout and feel) or the pointing devices (the trackpad is too small, and I’m done with using the trackpoint/eraserhead thing). The Surface Laptops keyboards and trackpads have always seemed a lot more sensible to me in how they are designed.</p>

<h1 id="siri-reveals-apple-event-planned-for-tuesday-april-20">Siri Reveals Apple Event Planned for Tuesday, April 20</h1>

<p>I’m assuming that somebody’s job, every day, is to wake up in the morning and ask Siri “<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/13/siri-apple-event-tuesday-april-20/">When is the next Apple Event</a>?” I’m glad I didn’t try to change careers back in 2009 or 2011 (when I thought of it) and get into tech journalism.</p>

<p>I never would have predicted that in 2021 I would be using <a href="https://farmanager.com">a text-mode file manager from the 1990s</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/VladimirMarkelov/ttdl">command-line based to-do list program</a>, and, at least sometimes (by choice!), the <a href="https://www.vim.org">Vim</a> text editor.</p>

<p>Tonight I published a huge update to the website for my first iOS app: <a href="https://swiftodoapp.com">SwiftoDo</a>. What was once a one page site with a very outdated template is now a Hugo-based site full of information. There is a lot more that I could add, it is now so much better than my old site I had to publish it.</p>

<h1 id="james-hoffman-s-aeropress-video">James Hoffman’s AeroPress video</h1>

<p>Last year when I was looking for something soothing to watch on YouTube, I came across James Hoffmann’s many videos about coffee, coffee machines, coffee products, and so on. I have watched a ton of them, mostly because I like his voice and demeanor. <a href="https://youtu.be/aidvrssMSGo">His latest video</a> is about the <a href="https://aeropress.com">AeroPress</a>, which I have used for many, many years. I actually learned something new from it: People use the funnel, which is meant to help put your coffee grounds into the press without making a mess, to brew coffee into cups with mouths too small for the bottom of the AeroPress. I have to try that! He also states in the video that the AeroPress is easy to make good coffee from, but is difficult to master. I actually put very little effort into my AeroPress use—far less than I used to when I first starting using it. I have found that my AeroPress brewing technique, no matter how sloppy or lazy, doesn’t seem to affect my coffee all that much. It prefer not stressing about it anymore.</p>

<h1 id="linux-on-the-m1-mac-mini">Linux on the M1 Mac Mini</h1>

<p>The Linux kernel is <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/soc/soc.git/commit/?h=for-next&amp;id=0d5fe4b31785b732b71e764b55cda5c8d6e3bbbf">gaining Apple M1 support</a>. I have been wondering if, years from now, I can move my M1 Mac Mini to a home app-server role, running Linux, when it gets too old for Xcode and stops getting macOS updates. I have a Celeron based PC doing that for me now, but it runs hot and can be noisy, too. If a machine can run Linux, it extends its lifespan considerably for me.</p>

<h1 id="my-first-failed-attempt-to-flash-qmk-on-my-mechanical-keyboard">My (first) failed attempt to flash QMK on my mechanical keyboard</h1>

<p>I wasted an hour last night trying to install <a href="https://qmk.fm">QMK firmware</a> on my work computer’s mechanical keyboard, a <a href="https://www.durgod.com/page9?product_id=47&amp;_l=en">Durgod Taurus K320</a>. I have a love/hate relationship with it. I love that it has the best build quality, rigidity, stabilization, keycaps, and typing feel and sound of any of the many (many!) keyboards I have owned over the years. I hate that its software is buggy: so buggy that sometimes the keyboard hangs and I have to unplug it to fix it; so buggy that I have to plug it in directly to my laptop rather than through a USB hub; so buggy that that I cannot program its layers the way I want to.</p>

<p>Very recently, someone figured out how to run QMK firmware on it, which could resolve the stability and customizability problems I have with the board. Unfortunately, I was not able to figure out how to flash the firmware to the keyboard. The main problem I faced was that the keyboard was not recognized by the QMK Toolkit software (on Windows) even after I put the keyboard into bootloader mode, and even after I started messing with the bootloader firmware using <a href="https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/guides/driver_installation_zadig">Zadig</a>.</p>

<p>After lots of tries, I couldn’t figure out. I think I dodged a bullet, though, because I’m not sure QMK can control the RGB backlighting, which, on this keyboard, is necessary to see the key legends. Fortunately, despite me trying to mess with it, my keyboard still works as well as it did before. It’s not perfect, and I really would like to create a more robust <code>Fn</code> (function key) layer, but I will live with it for now.</p>

<p>🎵 I’m listening to <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/for-her/1499733036?i=1499733045"><em>Gaslighter</em> by The Chicks</a> again today. It is one of my favorite albums of 2020. Everything is great about it, from the catchy choruses to the close harmonies to the clean production. My favorite part of it is the songwriting, which is fueled with righteous anger and makes for compelling country-pop music.</p>

<p>Today I made the mistake to look up someone I knew while I was in high school. I was reading an article about illegal drugs, and thought about a high school friend’s younger brother who ran into some drug problems about 20 years ago. Sadly, I discovered that he died last year. I can only conjecture, but it seems, based on what else happened to him over the past few years, that drug problems led to his premature death. Learning about what happened to him made me very sad.</p>

<h1 id="apple-arcade-just-got-a-huge-update-of-new-games-including-some-mobile-classics">Apple Arcade just got a huge update of new games, including some mobile classics</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22362388/apple-arcade-game-subscription-update-monument-valley-threes-iphone-ipad">As reported by Andrew Webster in <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple’s gaming subscription service just got a massive influx of new titles. The headliner is Fantasian — the latest release from the creator of Final Fantasy — which is joined by other titles like new versions of NBA 2K and The Oregon Trail, and World of Demons from PlatinumGames. As part of the update, the service is getting two new categories of games: Apple calls them “Timeless Classics” and “App Store Greats.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I literally just canceled my (second) Apple Arcade free trial twelve hours before this announcement. I just can’t seem to get into Apple Arcade at all. For the most part, the reason is that I find my iPhone 12 mini to be too small to be a compelling gaming device. Secondarily, I don’t want to get into a complex, involved game on my iPhone or iPad. I prefer my mobile games to be simple things that can be jumped into and out of, more like the “Timeless Classics” that Apple is now adding to Apple Arcade. It’s too bad for Apple Arcade that I already own almost all of those games.</p>

<h1 id="fully-vaccinated-people-may-travel-cdc-says">Fully vaccinated people may travel, CDC says</h1>

<p>As reported by Lena H. Sun and Lori Aratani in <em>The Washington Post</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Federal health officials gave the green light Friday for fully vaccinated people to resume travel as an estimated 100 million Americans have had at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine, and evidence mounts of the shots’ effectiveness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s good news, but it doesn’t make me want to go out and travel by plane or train anytime soon.</p>

<p>I am fully vaccinated, but my kids are not (because, of course, there is no approved vaccine for children yet), and that dramatically limits my desire to travel, eat in indoor restaurants, or do any indoor activities in public unless they are absolutely necessary. I understand that it is probably quite safe for me to do some of these activities (provided I wear a mask, etc.), but it seems to me that doing so would still be (even more) uncomfortable and unpleasant (than it was before).</p>

<p>My wife and I have been talking every day about what is OK or not OK for us to do now that we are vaccinated. Despite both being vaccinated, we are still not comfortable dining in restaurants or staying in hotels (don’t even talk about flying!), but we have realized that we are way behind our friends and acquaintances in terms of risk taking. We remain concerned about our children being explored to the virus, and about the rising and “extremely high” (per <em>The New York Times</em>) COVID-19 risk level our county is currently at. It just doesn’t make sense for us to change our behavior that much yet—at least not until the local COVID infection numbers go down quite a bit, which won’t happen until after a lot more people get vaccinated.</p>

<p>⚾️ For the first time in over a year I have a baseball game on in the background as I work. I hope to get by the with MLB “free game of the day” offering this year, rather than paying to subscribe to the season package. There was no free game for the season opener yesterday, though, so I’m watching a spring training game.</p>

<h1 id="openai-s-text-generating-system-gpt-3-is-now-spewing-out-4-5-billion-words-a-day">OpenAI’s text-generating system GPT-3 is now spewing out 4.5 billion words a day</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356180/openai-gpt-3-text-generation-words-day">James Vincent reports in <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best-known AI text-generator is OpenAI’s GPT-3, which the company recently announced is now being used in more than 300 different apps, by “tens of thousands” of developers, and producing 4.5 billion words per day. That’s a lot of robot verbiage. This may be an arbitrary milestone for OpenAI to celebrate, but it’s also a useful indicator of the growing scale, impact, and commercial potential of AI text generation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The obvious industry target for auto-text is journalism. It is already being used there for sports reporting, and could probably be used for local government reporting too. There are other areas it will encroach on that are news-adjacent (think financial news or business book digest services like Blinkist), like education and entertainment.</p>

<p>I’m an auditor, and I think that, eventually, auto-text is going to destroy about 50% of our billable hours. Auditors spend a <em>ton</em> of time writing. We document our procedures. We record our work. We summarize our findings. We write reports for our clients. Making sense of all the work, both for our own understanding and for our client’s, for the sake of writing it down, takes a lot of time. Moreover, the simple act of typing it out and, especially, hyperlinking everything together so we support our conclusions, requires a lot of manual work. Some of this work is communicative, but a lot of it (like the hyperlinking part) is mechanical. Consequently, much of it is ripe for automation.</p>

<p>I think, though, that transforming this laborious and time-consuming writing process into something auto-generated by a bot would produce a lot more <em>information</em> but a lot less <em>knowledge</em> than we had before. You gain a lot more understanding how a company, business process, or control works by writing about it than by reading about it. Why? Because writing is <em>thinking</em>. To write well is mentally strenuous. It requires you to think how you would communicate an idea to someone else, notably someone else with a different perspective and different knowledge than you have. At the end of the writing process, you should understand your subject backwards and forwards and from all sides; you could probably describe it in a number of different ways; and you will likely remember the gist of it, and specific nuances about it, for far longer than you would if you had just read about it in a report.</p>

<p>The world won’t end, and few will shed tears, when AI writes audit reports and work papers. Audits cost money, and businesses mostly don’t think they benefit from them. If it makes the auditors less knowledgeable, however, side effects will develop, and those will be long-lasting. Knowledgable auditors help make good control environments possible, which leads to more stable and more solvent companies. Decreasing the understanding of auditors could make systems and processes more unstable and less trustworthy over time. Additionally, knowledgable auditors often move to the business side and go on to manage well-controlled organizations. While the auditor-to-manager career path will likely continue, such moves would not result in the same level of management quality if the auditors don’t have to think as deeply about what they are auditing as they did before the AI text-bots took over. Neither of these side effects bodes particularly well for the people the auditors and the audited companies (and their fancy AI) serve.</p>

<h1 id="there-is-no-perfect-template-just-pick-one">There is no perfect template—just pick one</h1>

<p>I stayed up late last night drafting a new, Hugo-driven version of one of my websites. I went from having nothing at all built to having about one third of the site done in a couple hours. The result, I think, will be more plain (and maybe more ugly) than the existing site, but it will be less janky on mobile devices.</p>

<p>I sank a lot of time over the past week looking for a Hugo theme that is perfect for my needs, but I couldn’t find one. For the sake of achieving my simple goal of refreshing my tiny websites, I gave up the goal of visual perfection, and am driving forward with a theme that I think is OK that works well enough for me.</p>

<p>From my perspective, I want my site to be easier to maintain and add content. That is more important to me than having a site that looks really slick. My old websites don’t look slick anymore, anyway: No one is fooled by outdated HTML templates into thinking that my very niche apps are developed by a huge, sophisticated software corporation.</p>

<h1 id="the-organizational-rabbit-hole">The organizational rabbit hole</h1>

<p>This is a short, short version of what happened to me over the past week when I decided to get organized.</p>

<ol>
<li>Form a desire to organize my project files differently.</li>
<li>Discover the <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com">Johnny Decimal</a> system.</li>
<li>Create a taxonomy for my files in a text file.</li>
<li>Start writing PowerShell script to switch folders based on the Johnny Decimal number</li>
<li>Start writing a PowerShell script to index all the Johnny Decimal numbers in my folder tree</li>
<li>Think about working with files from the command line more often</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://midnight-commander.org">Midnight Commander</a> for a command line file manager</li>
<li>Learn a lot of Midnight Commander shortcuts and customizations</li>
<li>Learn about <a href="https://farmanager.com">Far Manager</a>, which is a lot like Midnight Commander but works much better on Windows</li>
<li>Run into keyboard shortcut conflicts with Windows Terminal</li>
<li>Learn about assigning and removing keyboard shortcuts in Windows Terminal</li>
<li>Start thinking about using <a href="http://todotxt.org">todo.txt</a> from the Windows Terminal, because my <a href="https://www.taskpaper.com">TaskPaper</a> file has been too big for months and is awful to work with</li>
<li>Tried to find a todo.txt command line app for Windows that works on my machine</li>
<li>Thought about writing my own todo.txt command line app using an old C# library I created</li>
</ol>

<p>And&hellip;I still haven’t organized anything yet. 😅</p>

<h1 id="the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier">The Falcon and the Winter Soldier 📺</h1>

<p>I watched episode one of <a href="https://www.marvel.com/tv-shows/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier/1"><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a> this week. It’s a show about two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe">MCU</a> characters I don’t particularly care that much about, so it wasn’t something I was really looking forward to, but I pay for Disney+ anyway and thought I may as well check it out. Reader, I liked it!</p>

<p>My first impression is that it looks like it cost a zillion dollars. Special-effects-wise, it looks on par with the Marvel movies. Based on that alone, I could see why Disney originally wanted it to premiere first, before <em>WandaVision</em> and whatever other Marvel shows are being developed.</p>

<p>My second impression is that I appreciated that it was trying to tell a Black story as well as a super hero story. I am not optimistic that Sam’s (The Falcon’s) family side story is going to be anything but predictable, but it is nice to see an attempt to give the character some grounding in reality. Race is an issue that touches everything in American life, unfortunately. In some ways, it would be disrespectful to Sam’s character and to the audience not to address that in some way.</p>

<p>I don’t have anything bad to say about the Winter Soldier part of the show, but it isn’t as interesting to me. I expect it to follow a predictable “antihero almost, but doesn’t quite, make good” formula, but maybe the writers will surprise me.</p>

<p>Predictability aside, I’m just glad to have something new and fun to watch.</p>

<h1 id="the-menu-key">The menu key</h1>

<p>I was thinking about creating a training presentation to help my coworkers with keyboards shortcuts, but was dismayed to see that our Lenovo laptop keyboards (which I never use, because I work from home and use external peripherals) don’t even have a menu key. Someone decided that <code>Print Screen</code> was more important, which may even be true, but it doesn’t help me make a good presentation for my coworkers. The menu key alternative, <code>Shift+F10</code> is going to be a very hard sell, especially because <code>F10</code> on the laptop requires the <code>Fn</code> key to be pressed, too.</p>

<p>I have gone from someone who did not use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_key">menu key</a> on my keyboard for 20+ years (since it was invented in the 1990s) to someone who can’t live without it (on my Windows at least). I made it a point to start using it a few months ago, and now I use it constantly. I recommend that all Windows users with an ANSI or ISO keyboard layout check it out. That key is positioned right underneath your thumb when you use the arrow keys.</p>

<p>🎵 “<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/canadas-country/pl.f2da318b2e1a4f358f10efc2021cba6e">Canada’s Country</a>”: I’ve been enjoying this laid-back playlist while I work. Honestly, I didn’t know Canada made country music. Unfortunately, there’s nothing particularly <em>Canadian</em> about it. It would be cool if there were.</p>

<p>I was not I initially interested at all in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Snyder%27s_Justice_League">Snyder Cut of <em>Justice League</em></a> but I ended up watching it anyway, over two nights. I’m glad I did.</p>

<p>I thought the theatrical release of <em>Justice League</em> was pretty bad, but not quite as bad as the professional movie review consensus was. I figured that the Snyder cut must be better, but I was surprised at how much better it is. Granted, it still isn’t <em>good</em>. It doesn’t fix its pacing problems. It still is not as brisk and pleasurable as the best of the Marvel movies. It doesn’t tell a cohesive story, but it also crams in too many story lines for a non-DC fan to keep track of. It still has some dumb script problems, such every single part of the nonsensical museum height/terrorist bombing blot in the opening Wonder Woman scene, that could have been solved by editing a few sentences of dialog. While not exactly <em>good</em>, it is a good bad movie now. Its reach often exceeds its grasp, but it offers a lot of interesting material to people who are already fans. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to be the kind of movie that would bring a lot new fans in.</p>

<p>It is now very clear to me that Zach Snyder’s vision was dark and wild and weird—definitely too much of all of those things to launch a successful franchise—but Joss Whedon’s contributions were just awful: tasteless, asinine, nonsensical, and insulting to the audience. Whedon’s dialog (notably Superman’s and The Flash’s) and the character moments he created, like the race between The Flash and Superman, are embarrassing to watch and make the characters seem stupid. Snyder’s cut simply had better dialog for them. Simply getting rid of the random <em>people</em> that Whedon put into that nuclear wasteland Russian city—the one that existed in the movie only to be destroyed in a bout of cinematic excess—made the climax bearable. Who needs to worry about a family who shouldn’t be living in a nuclear wasteland anyway when the entire world is already at stake? Whedon really did screw up that movie.</p>

<p>I think that the Snyder Cut works very well for fans of the comics, especially fans of the “what-if” versions of all the famous characters. Some fans, like me, believe that comic book characters are archetypes, and really can be <em>anything</em>, and no representation of them is truly canonical. The grim, dark version of the Justice League is an interesting thought experiment, one of many worth exploring. It is not something I ever felt hung up on as “not the real version” of Superman or whatever. The Snyder Cut isn’t the real version of the DC Universe to me, because nothing is. It’s all just ideas and entertainment anyway.</p>

<h1 id="alt-f4">Alt+F4</h1>

<p>I have been using <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com">AutoHotKey</a> for many years, and I never thought until today to map <code>Windows+Q</code> to quit the active app and close the active window. That creates something very similar to Mac’s <code>Command+Q</code> shortcut to Windows.</p>

<p>The default Windows keyboard shortcut for quitting an app is <code>Alt+F4</code>, which is a two hand operation for me. Note that in AutoHotKey, you don’t even need to send that key command; you can use the WinClose function instead:</p>

<p>#q::
WinClose, A
Return</p>

<p>One of the best things Apple has ever done with their support of keyboard shortcuts was to pretend that function keys (<code>F1</code> through <code>F12</code>) don’t exist.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing">Chiam Gartenberg reports in <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the company’s “Engineering the Future” announcement today, Gelsinger announced plans to outsource more of Intel’s chip production to third-party foundries; a $20 billion investment into two new fabs in Arizona; and a new branch of the company called Intel Foundry Services, which will see Intel’s foundries produce chips for other companies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intel has had an awful decade, having missed out on smartphone chips and having stalled out at their 14nm process for years. Still, it is a strategically important company for my country, and I have to ill will toward it, even if I don’t prefer their products right now. I would love to see them become competitive again.</p>

<p>The idea of Intel fabbing chips for other companies is a big deal. Intel has never done that before. It seems to me like it could be the first step of spinning off that part of the business into its own company, and focusing on process shrinks in ways that the fully integrated Intel could not before.</p>

<h1 id="seven-mass-shootings-in-seven-days">Seven mass shootings in seven days</h1>

<p>Josh Berlinger of <em>CNN</em> reports today that <a href="http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_d3f4ea80ea0d81acb5d30fcf939c3243">the Colorado attack is the 7th mass shooting in 7 days in the US</a>.</p>

<p>It seemed like there were periods in recent years in which we had a deadly mass shooting in the national news at least every week, if not several times each week. There has been something of a pause due to COVID, for understandable reasons. Unfortunately, we seem to be un-pausing now. Sadly, mass shooting rates in the U.S. seem to be getting back to normal.</p>

<p>But what is “normal?” It is actually hard to know what is normal for gun violence in the U.S. Here’s an interesting factoid from the article about my country’s gun problem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear how this number of mass shootings compares to an average week in the US.</p>

<p>Though some official gun violence data is available, the US federal government does not have a centralized system or database to track firearm incidents and mass shootings nationwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks some gun violence data, nearly 40,000 people were killed in incidents involving firearms in 2019.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article omits the reason for this: There are actually <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-government-study-gun-violence/story?id=50300379">laws against government agencies, such as the CDC, accurately tracking gun violence</a>. That’s just stupid and self-defeating. While dying due to gun violence is incredibly unlikely, statistically speaking, it is also completely unnecessary. We should treat <a href="https://usafacts.org/data/topics/security-safety/crime-and-justice/firearms/firearm-deaths/">all gun deaths</a> as <em>preventable</em> and <em>unacceptable</em>. Only then can we have the mental and moral clarity to do something about it.</p>

<h1 id="ulysses-and-micro-blog">Ulysses and Micro.blog</h1>

<p>It is amazing that <a href="https://blog.ulysses.app/ulysses-22/">Ulysses supports posting to Micro.blog now</a>. I love the functionality, and its inclusion definitely cements Ulysses as my only writing app on iOS and macOS at this point.</p>

<p>Now let’s bug the Ulysses team to do some other cool things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Implement publishing workflows, by which publishing a sheet can automatically trigger the sheet to be tagged with a keyword, be moved to a particular folder (such as “published”), or call an iOS Shortcut.</li>
<li>Make every command accessible via a hardware keyboard shortcut. (I’m thinking mainly of the iPad version.)</li>
<li>Add a command palette, like Visual Studio Code and Sublime Text have.</li>
<li>Support <a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/">Mermaid</a>, a text-based markup language for creating flowcharts, in fenced code blocks, like <a href="https://typora.io">Typora</a> does.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="cdc-says-schools-can-now-space-students-3-feet-apart-rather-than-6">CDC Says Schools Can Now Space Students 3 Feet Apart, Rather Than 6</h1>

<p><a href="https://text.npr.org/978608714">As Anya Kamenetz, Cory Turner, and Allison Aubrey report on the <em>NPR</em> website today</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its guidance for schools. On Friday, the agency announced it &ldquo;now recommends that, with universal masking, students should maintain a distance of at least 3 feet in classroom settings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Previously the guidance stated, &ldquo;Physical distancing (at least 6 feet) should be maximized to the greatest extent possible.&rdquo; The new guidelines still call for 6 feet of distance between adults and students as well as in common areas, such as auditoriums, and when masks are off, such as while eating. And the 6-foot distancing rule still applies for the general public in settings such as grocery stores.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This news is causing a good deal of consternation in my family. COVID cases are going up in our local schools right now. There has been an extremely high risk level in the community for several weeks, and in-person instruction is expanding anyway. Our school systems have been flatly stating that they will open even though they cannot conform with some of the requirements. This change in CDC requirements makes it easier for them to comply.</p>

<p>I think the changing of, and complexity in, the distancing rules makes them seem suspect and less likely to be followed at all. This concern is counterbalanced, however, by my belief that distancing helps very little in the classroom, because every classroom I have seen has poor ventilation. My wife and I are keeping our kids remote until the end of the school year. We are still hopeful enough to consider September as the right time to send them back to in-person learning.</p>

<p>🎵 I’m currently listening to <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/chemtrails-over-the-country-club/1545567745"><em>Chemtrails over the Country Club</em></a> by Lana Del Ray for the first time. I have been waiting for this one. Lana Del Ray is one of my favorite artists. It’s too soon for me to tell how much I like it.</p>

<h1 id="friday-is-time-for-inbox-zero">Friday is time for Inbox Zero</h1>

<p>I have been an <a href="http://www.43folders.com/43-folders-series-inbox-zero">Inbox Zero</a> guy since the early 2000s. Now I can’t keep up with my email; it comes in too fast, and I actually have work to do that demands my attention. Consequently, my Inbox is almost never empty.</p>

<p>Now, mostly on Fridays, I just select all my Inbox emails (<code>Ctrl-A</code>) and move them to my Archive folder (<code>Ctrl-Shift-1</code> thanks to an <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/automate-common-or-repetitive-tasks-with-quick-steps-b184f89f-3738-4562-96de-c0244ea830f2">Outlook Quick Step</a> I created), whether I have processed them or not. The emails aren’t deleted, they are just out of my Inbox, and that’s good enough.</p>

<p>I am investing some time trying to see if I could implement a <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com">Johnny Decimal</a> system for my files at work. Some of the constraints are tricky to deal with, but the general idea of it dovetails into what I have been doing for organization, and takes it one or two steps further.</p>

<h1 id="apple-s-new-ipad-pro-leaks-ahead-of-rumored-event">Apple&rsquo;s new iPad Pro leaks ahead of rumored event</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-new-ipad-pro-leaks-ahead-of-rumored-event/">Corinne Reichert and Stephen Shankland report in <em>CNET</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple will launch a series of new iPads in April, a report Wednesday said. The new iPad Pros will come with Apple&rsquo;s homemade M1 chips, a Thunderbolt port, and better cameras and screens, according to Bloomberg. They will reportedly come in 11- and 12.9-inch display sizes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s cool. Maybe I’m not a “Pro” but the iPad Air 4 is just about perfect for me. From my layman’s perspective, the A14-based chip in the iPad Air 4 is very similar to the M1, minus some of the cores. The 2020 iPad Pro’s chip (an A12Z) is a generation or two behind that, though it has more cores than the A14 does. Apple obviously needs to remedy that to help justify the iPad Pro’s greater price.</p>

<p>I am thinking that the “Thunderbolt” port is merely following the direction that everything with a USB-C connector is going in: USB 4 compatibility. That, plus more processor cores, sounds good for videographers, podcasters, photographers, and (I guess) gamers. Unfortunately, if Apple doesn’t fix some problems with the Files app (just try transferring a gigabyte-sized file off your iPad to a network share—I’ll wait&hellip;for it to fail), these performance boosts will be hamstrung.</p>

<h1 id="effective-presentations">Effective Presentations</h1>

<p>When it comes to creating effective PowerPoint presentations for work, my reach still exceeds my grasp.</p>

<p>I know a lot of important concepts, including the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>The slide deck is a visual aid, <em>not</em> the presentation</li>
<li>Focus on one idea per slide</li>
<li>Focus on very few visual elements/focus points per slide (e.g., five or six, maximum)</li>
<li>Light text on a dark background is easier on the eye</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, when I try to apply those ideas, I feel like I’m not getting anywhere. All of my slides look completely conventional: no better than those I created many years ago. I think they are effective, but they are ugly and boring. It does not help that I have to present on topics that are dry and technical in nature. I also feel hamstrung by my company’s PowerPoint template, which is quite busy, focuses attention on the wrong areas of the slide (i.e., the title and the footer), and has (almost completely) black text on a white background.</p>

<p>I think I need to invent a visual style that I can get away with on at least some of my slides:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full-bleed images that cover the entire slide, and obviate the need for titles or footers on my slides.</li>
<li>Text boxes that float over the images, or captions that fill in the top title area that is already part of our PowerPoint template.</li>
</ul>

<p>I just hope, if I do these things, my slides won’t end up looking like tired internet memes.</p>

<p>🎵 The Hold Steady’s latest album, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/open-door-policy/1539020630">Open Door Policy</a>, is growing on me. I know reviewers love it, because it is a return to form, but I was hoping for something different. It’s hard to say, what, though. Something that’s a mix of fun and depressing, like my favorite Hold Steady lyrics, I guess.</p>

<h1 id="apple-discontinues-original-homepod-will-focus-on-mini">Apple discontinues original HomePod, will focus on mini</h1>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-will-focus-on-mini/">Matthew Panzarino of <em>TechCrunch</em> reports</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple has discontinued its original HomePod after four years. It says that it will continue to produce and focus on the HomePod mini, introduced last year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I, like many audiophiles, passed on the original HomePod due to its high price and lack of connectivity. I’m sure I would have enjoyed how it sounded, and its size is just right for me, but I would likely have had to buy two of them to be fully satisfied (stereo separation is important to me). At $349 each, that was too expensive.</p>

<p>The smaller, cheaper HomePod mini holds little appeal to me, and seems to be a far less interesting product for the audio engineers at Apple to work on. For all I know, though, it sells in huge numbers, which makes it interesting in and of itself. Maybe a HomePod mini max (ha!) will be released someday, at around $150, which will hit the price/performance sweet spot I am looking for.</p>

<h1 id="the-covid-versary">The COVID-versary</h1>

<p>I guess, based on the occurrence of a President Biden speech, that this week marks <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/Voices/2021/03/12/Joe-Biden-COVID-19-anniversary-speech-full-text/8161615555448/">the one-year anniversary of COVID-19 in the United States</a>. To me, the baleful presence of COVID-19 has been around for what feels like much, much longer—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic">so long that I can’t even remember it clearly</a>.</p>

<p>My COVID panic started in early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_January_2020">January</a>, when we thought the disease was only in Wuhan. In America, for a couple weeks at least, it still seemed likely that the disease would never leave China, much like H1N1 and SARS never made a big impact here. For almost three months my mental state caromed between what I think of now as irrational fear and rational fear. I could see the whole year of 2020 play out in my imagination, way before my friends and family could see what was coming, but I could do nothing to stop it, and I could do almost nothing to protect my family from it. All those feelings felt very real and very debilitating, even when almost no one else around me was feeling them.</p>

<p>I had about two months of angst about COVID before it actually hit around here. The last time I went out with friends and family was, I think, on March 14, 2020. We went to see a musical and when out to eat at a crowded restaurant afterward. It was really hard for me to feel comfortable the entire time, but I didn’t want to let everybody down because I was concerned about a pandemic that hadn’t hit our area yet. Less than a week later, my entire family was on lockdown.</p>

<p>Back in January, February, and early March 2020, it didn’t help me at all to have known about the scope and length and shape of prior pandemics, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu">Spanish Flu</a>, which I know, from reading family letters, killed a bunch of people in my extended family about a hundred years ago. It didn’t help me at all to know what I should do and buy to prepare for it. It didn’t help me at all that I am smart enough to think for myself and to scrutinize, with a pretty good understanding of the relevant science and statistics, the information and advice experts were providing to us. All of these things just made me feel more uncertain and more cynical about what was going on.</p>

<p>A year later, I am feeling more hopeful. I have the vaccine after all, and am probably (but not definitely) immune to COVID 18. But my <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/monmouth-new-jersey-covid-cases.html">county is still at extremely high risk level</a>. The numbers are still higher than they were last year when all of us were in a panic. Despite that, all the states, even blue states like mine, are reopening rapidly and throwing caution to the wind, when it would be more prudent to do so more gradually. It makes me nervous that we are giving the virus a chance to circulate long enough to adapt resistance to our vaccines.</p>

<p>I was early in being scared of COVID, and I may be late in getting over that fear. I just hope that, when I look forward from today, whatever fear I feel is merely anxiety over things that will not play out, rather than the accurate foresight into the future that I had late last winter.</p>

<p>There was <a href="https://www.nj.com/news/2021/03/large-lakewood-brush-fire-closes-portion-of-gsp.html">a brush fire yesterday not too far from where I live</a>. Brush fires are incredibly rare where I live, so this is a curiosity to me. We have had dry, windy weather for about two weeks now, which makes wildfire conditions rife. My family was outside yesterday but fortunately we didn’t notice it; we must have been upwind.</p>

<p>I’m probably being a climate-change alarmist right now, but I think we have never had such frequent windstorms in New Jersey as we have had this winter.</p>

<p>I am grateful that the weather has changed from snowy and blustery to warm and calm. I have been able to take a walk after my lunch break for two days in a row. It feels nice.</p>

<h1 id="this-is-the-reality-of-black-girls-inauguration-poet-says-she-was-tailed-by-guard">&lsquo;This Is The Reality Of Black Girls&rsquo;: Inauguration Poet Says She Was Tailed By Guard</h1>

<p><a href="https://text.npr.org/974362036">Matthew S. Schwartz reports for NPR</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To millions of people around the world, the young poet Amanda Gorman represents hope, change and the promise of a better America.</p>

<p>But to a security guard on Friday night, the young African American woman represented a potential threat to public safety.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a sad story. My first thought was that Amanda Gorman could legitimately have been harmed in a situation like this. Then I thought, she should have a bodyguard or an entourage with her at all times for protection. <em>Then</em> I thought, she should not need to! That could ruin her life.</p>

<p>Amanda Gorman is a strong and bold speaker, and deserves the last word on the matter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In a sense, he was right,&rdquo; the former National Youth Poet Laureate added. &ldquo;I AM A THREAT: a threat to injustice, to inequality, to ignorance. Anyone who speaks the truth and walks with hope is an obvious and fatal danger to the powers that be.&rdquo;</p>

<h1 id="mermaid-for-flowcharts">Mermaid 🧜‍♀️ for flowcharts</h1>

<p>Tonight I learned about <a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/">Mermaid</a>, which is a plaintext markup language and renderer for creating flowcharts and other kinds of diagrams.</p>

<p>I want to make flowcharts quickly for my technical projects at work, but i don’t have Visio, and I hate fiddling with a GUI to line up shapes and worry about arrow lengths and so on. The way my mind works, I just want to type out what I want and have software figure out how to lay it out for me. I don’t care that much how it looks, as long as it is simple and makes sense.</p>

<p>Mermaid’s plaintext premise is really cool, and the syntax is flexible enough to not be awful. It is way more flexible than the examples on The Mermaid website originally led me to believe. You can name each shape whatever you like (not just single letter identifiers) and you can define the content (shapes) and relationships (arrows) separately if you want to.

<h1 id="gen-lock">Gen: Lock</h1>

<p>I watched “<a href="https://roosterteeth.com/series/gen-lock">Gen:lock</a>” over the past week. I was disappointed that it introduced a premise-breaking plot development in the penultimate episode. My beef is 100% spoiler-y.</p>

<p>The shows is a <a href="https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/tags/mecha">mecha anime</a>. Its premise is that, in some future war in which big robots piloted by people fight each other, a new type of mech is developed that is remotely controlled by very rare, very special kind of person. That person must bind her mind to the mech through a lot of hand-wavey technology called gen:lock.</p>

<p>The problem is, we learn three things in the final two episodes of season 1 that make the pilots unnecessary:</p>

<ol>
<li>A person’s mind can uploaded to, and downloaded from, a digital brain</li>
<li>A digital brain can be copied an indefinite number of times.</li>
<li>A digital brain is all that is needed to drive a mech</li>
</ol>

<p>If one pilot’s mind can be copied, without harming her, and then bound to any number of mechs, then why do we need the pilots at all, once you’ve got the first one’s mind copied? If the pilots aren’t really necessary, why haven’t the characters in charge of the gen:lock program figured that out yet?</p>

<p>I’m not sure I will pick it up again when season 2 comes out. Maybe this kind of anime isn’t for me.</p>

<h1 id="neera-tanden-is-biden-s-first-cabinet-level-nominee-to-withdraw">Neera Tanden is Biden’s first Cabinet-level nominee to withdraw</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/3/2/22310271/neera-tanden-biden-omb-withdraws">Ella Nilson at vox.com reports</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But much of Tanden’s résumé was overshadowed by her proliferous online posting — at least 1,000 tweets raking both Republicans and leftist Democrats over the coals — that Tanden quietly started deleting in November 2020.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven’t been following this story, but my interest was piqued when I learned that Neera Tanden’s nomination chances were in jeopardy because of her tweets from the past. People keep getting in trouble for what they post to Twitter. (“Social media” in these cases always is Twitter, too. That is probably just because it is public facing, though it is also a popular place for broadcasting, calling out, and grandstanding.)</p>

<p>It will soon be the conventional wisdom that those who seek high offices—in public service or in private industry—should have no public social media presence, no blog—certainly no Twitter account—maybe no public online presence at all. That bothers me because I think there is value in publishing one’s thoughts to the world, in a blog, vlog, podcast, or whatever other medium I can&rsquo;t even conceive of yet. People have an urge to share and should not feel that they will be punished for it, especially years after they tap the “post” button.</p>

<p>I understand that some people are deliberately awful on social media, and that <em>is</em> a problem, but isn&rsquo;t it also a problem that “the Internet never forgets?” <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">The right to be forgotten</a> is at both ridiculous to ask for and essential for people to get along with each other after a certain point. How should we evaluate a person based on what she posted online? Does it matter how long ago a thought was posted? What is fair? I think we are at a cultural crossroads regarding these questions, and may be stuck at that crossroads for a long, long time.</p>

<h1 id="trust">Trust</h1>

<p>Trust relies on three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Competence—can you do something well?</li>
<li>Benevolence—are you doing good?</li>
<li>Integrity—will you do the right thing, even when things are bad for you?</li>
</ol>

<p>I heard this breakdown on a podcast episode earlier this week, and loved the idea so much that I hastily dictated a note to Siri about it (I was in my car at the time), but I can’t recall which podcast I heard it on or who said it. I found an analogous summary of the idea on the Wiley Online Library site, in an abstract about a chapter of the book <em><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119206422.ch21">Handbook of Principles of Organizational Behavior: Indispensable Knowledge for Evidence‐Based Management, Second Edition</a></em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This chapter focuses on using the concepts of ability, benevolence, and integrity as a means of increasing trust. Ability, benevolence, and integrity are the most critical facets of trustworthiness. They foster a sense of trust in the leader by followers. Ability reflects the knowledge, skills, and aptitudes of a leader, in both technical areas and general management competencies. Benevolence and integrity are aspects of the leader&rsquo;s character, and require more time and attention on the part of followers before they can be reliably judged. In order to increase trust, leaders need to take steps to increase their ability, build their benevolence, and demonstrate their integrity. Leaders can do so on a follower‐by‐follower basis, but can also take steps to create a culture of trustworthiness within their organizations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Breaking down concepts like “trust”—which seem innately understood and obvious—into component parts can be very powerful. It gives you a way “in” when it comes to solving problems dependent on that concept.</p>

<h1 id="boston-red-sox-s-dustin-pedroia-announces-retirement-from-mlb">Boston Red Sox&rsquo;s Dustin Pedroia announces retirement from MLB</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/30816259/boston-red-sox-dustin-pedroia-announces-retirement-mlb">Joon Lee of ESPN reports</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boston Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia, who hasn&rsquo;t played since 2019 because of a knee injury suffered two seasons earlier, announced his retirement Monday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could it have ended better and I finished my career the right way? Yeah of course,&rdquo; Pedroia said on a Zoom call with the media. &ldquo;But there was a reason I was the first one dressed at 5:30 for a 7 o&rsquo;clock game. I always tell my teammates that you never know if the game is going to start early. My biggest thing in my mind was that this could be my last game and you don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s the best way I approached it from Little League on. I had the best time playing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a Red Sox fan, Pedroia’s retirement is no surprise. He hasn’t been physically able to play for years, since he got injured by a Manny Machado slide at second base. It is sad nonetheless. In his prime, he was fun and exciting to watch, and embodied the quality I enjoy seeing the most as a fan: “the love of the game.”</p>

<h1 id="nyu-researchers-find-no-evidence-of-anti-conservative-bias-on-social-media">NYU researchers find no evidence of anti-conservative bias on social media</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260269/anti-conservative-bias-social-media-no-evidence-nyu-research">Kim Lyons reports in <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The contention that social media as an industry censors conservatives is now, as we speak, becoming part of an even broader disinformation campaign from the right, that conservatives are being silenced all across American society,” the report’s lead researcher Paul Barrett said in an interview with The Verge. “This is the obvious post-Trump theme, we’re seeing it on Fox News, hearing it from Trump lieutenants, and I think it will continue indefinitely. Rather than any of this going away with Trump leaving Washington, it’s only getting more intense.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one of those studies that <em>may</em> help future historians sort through the mess we are living through now. It is pretty obvious to me that there is a conservative bias on social media rather than a liberal one. The shocking election in 2016 of a mendacious “conservative” social media gasbag is enough proof. That he wasn’t deplatformed until he lost the 2020 election, despite sowing devision and inciting violence on social media platforms, is further proof of it.</p>

<p>I bristle now at hearing or seeing the word “conservative” describe the people running a disinformation campaign against their fellow citizens. There’s nothing “conservative” about this influential and dangerous wing of the Republican Party, which is undermining the basic traditions and institutions of society. I identify strongly as a political progressive, but I am also quite conservative in how I think that people should behave publicly and how ethically and transparently political institutions should be run.</p>

<h1 id="fullmetal-alchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</h1>

<p>While I have been working a ton lately, I can’t work every second of the day. I have been watching the “Fullmetal Alchemist” anime series (there are two), mostly late at night, to unwind.</p>

<p>I watched the entirety of “Fullmetal Alchemist”—which is the first anime adaptation of the manga—first. Because it veers widely off of the plot of the manga (which, since I am not a manga reader, I don’t care about), it seems to be widely considered the lesser of the two adaptations. I think that sells it short. There are lots of sad, thought-provoking episodes, especially toward the beginning of the run, in which characters and the audience question what it means to be human, and what is the value of a human soul. These questions build up to big ideas and set pieces by the end, which is satisfying. There are some structural problems with how the story is told—mostly in the way the timeline, pacing, and character balance shift between the beginning, middle, and end of the series—but there is no problem that majorly detracts from the series as a whole. You could quibble that a lot of the theory behind how the magic system works doesn’t make any sense, which is vital to the overall theme of the series. Consider, however, that it is a <em>magic system</em>, you have to suspend disbelief quite a bit to begin with, and of course it doesn’t make perfect sense.</p>

<p>I am almost done watching the second adaptation, “Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood”, which stays true to the manga plot and is generally lauded as the better of the two anime series. At this point, I don’t think of it as “better” but it certainly is much different. The stakes in “Brotherhood” are much higher, the characters are more tightly integrated throughout the series, and the tone overall is funnier and less sad, despite the raised stakes and some (somewhat) more mature relationship elements between childhood friends/teenage-phenoms Edward and Winry. Despite these advantages, “Brotherhood” is far more cartoony in style, which I don’t prefer. It uses <em>chibi</em> (super deformed) style far more heavily than the first adaptation did, which I find distracting—the characters are often blowing their stacks in anger or are extremely embarrassed or go into some of other extreme, but emotionally and visually, that takes me out of the story a bit. That is a relatively small demerit, however, and it is offset by the increased complexity of the story.</p>

<p>I am eager to see how “Brotherhood” ends, and would recommend that everyone try watching both series, especially the first one, because it is very good despite being the less-loved one.</p>

<h1 id="little-voice">Little Voice</h1>

<p>My wife and I recently discovered the Apple TV+ show “<a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/little-voice/umc.cmc.4x932osv992wjjdq7ce12za2r">Little Voice</a>” and very much enjoy it.</p>

<p>It is different in pace and tone from other shows (like “Curb Your Enthusiasm”) that we have been watching lately. While there is a lot going on in each episode, the pace feels slow and thoughtful, as if the show is focused mainly on the growth of its characters and on illustrating (a version of) the New York City music scene. I would not recommend watching “Little Voice” for its main plot, because it appears to follow the well-worn path of “talented-but-unknown artist slowly becomes successful.” That said, there are a ton of great character moments throughout.</p>

<p>The main draw of the show is the music, most of which are songs written by series co-creator Sara Bareilles. There is a lot of music performance in each episode. All these sections look great, sound great, and are integrated completely naturally into the story. However, they serve as the primary reason why the pace is slow. If you don’t like the music, then the show will not be for you.</p>

<p>Overall, I think that “Little Voice” is under-rated. It didn’t blow up like “Ted Lasso” (which is, indeed, great) or “Central Park” (which is also great), but is my third-favorite Apple TV+ series thus far.</p>

<p>I have been super, super, super busy today, and it just won’t stop. It looks like I’ll be working a lot of overtime&hellip;like right now. At least, once the kids go to bed, I can put my headphones back on and enjoy some music while I work.</p>

<h1 id="the-business-of-influenece-with-mkbhd">The Business of Influenece with MKBHD</h1>

<p>I found this <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22231657/mkbhd-marques-brownlee-interview-youtube-creator-influencer-decoder">fairly long interview on <em>The Verge</em></a> with Marques Brownlee (<a href="https://youtube.com/c/mkbhd">MKBHD on YouTube</a>) to be very interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But what looks effortless and fun to the viewer is often the result of careful planning and investment. YouTubers are entrepreneurs, and Brownlee — my guest on today’s episode of Decoder — talks that talk with the best of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marques Brownlee could be described as “tech reviewer” or a “social media influencer” or a “YouTuber.” I don’t watch all his videos, but I have checked in with his YouTube channel periodically since I first saw him (as a college student!) on an episode of TWiT. While he is telegenic and charismatic, he also presents himself as someone with a strong sense of ethics who is very smart and thoughtful about he approaches his business. This interview gives a pretty long look into Marques Brownlee’s professional world.</p>

<p>My wife, who is a high school teacher, recently reported to me that one of the top “professions” that teens want to go into is “social media influencer.” That is kind of eyeroll-inducing to me, but I suppose it is as realistic and as meaningful an aspiration as “famous writer” was to me. It is important to know how much work goes into that sort of job, and how much time, investment, and infrastructure goes into keeping up with the competition.</p>

<p>I don’t really want to criticize <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/tweetbot-6-moves-to-subscription-pricing/">TapBots for making TweetBot version 6 a subscription app</a>. I would like to highlight that $6.99/yr is a reasonable price to pay every year if you use an app every day. I wish more annual app subscriptions were below the $9.99 level.</p>

<p><a href="https://kottke.org/21/01/the-covid-19-vaccines-are-amazing-lets-quickly-get-them-into-peoples-arms">Jason Kottke’s blog post</a> offers some great advice that we all should heed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So what can you do about this right now? 1. Stop worrying about the variants until the experts let us know we have something to worry about. 2. If you are eligible for the vaccine, get it! 3. Spread the word about vaccine availability in your area. Yesterday Vermont opened signups for vaccination appointments for all Vermonters 75 and older, and I texted/emailed everyone I could think of who was over 75 or who had parents/relatives/friends who are over 75 to urge them to sign up or spread the word. 4. Continue to wear a mask (a better one if possible), wash your hands, social distance, stay home when possible, don’t spend time indoors w/ strangers, etc. Thanks to these remarkable vaccines, real relief is in sight — let’s keep on track and see this thing through.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My family is now obsessed with wearing two layers of masks, which I tried but couldn’t get to work with my glasses on. I am more interested in finally being able to buy and wear N95, KN95, and KN94 (my favorite) masks, which are more effective than the cloth masks and surgical masks I have been stuck with since February.</p>

<p>In New Jersey, vaccine distribution is both successful (my wife, who is a teacher, got her first dose yesterday) and a total mess (it is very hard to get an appointment, there is no central coordination of virus distribution, and any effective effort on prioritizing inoculations for higher-risk groups is effective gone). If my family is a good indicator of people’s behavior, then lots of us New Jerseyans keep hammering away at the appointment systems, trying to get a better appointment slot, which further jams up the system.</p>

<p>I wrote a support email to <a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a> last week inquiring about <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> support. I got a response that said that it was on their “immediate roadmap” which is pretty exciting and still slightly mysterious.🤞</p>

<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/11/amid-coronavirus-flu-cases-record-low/4127197001/">This article in <em>USA Today</em></a> confirms my suspicions that all the anti-COVID measures would drastically reduce the prevalence of seasonal flu in the U.S.:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the 2019 flu season from Sept. 29 to Dec. 28, the CDC reported more than 65,000 cases of influenza nationwide. During the same period last year, the agency reported 1,016 cases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get a vaccine every year for the flu—and luckily have not caught it since I was in elementary school—but other than that, I never think about it. My dream right now is that the COVID vaccine be the same kind of thing: a prick on the arm once a year, and otherwise nothing much to think about.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/barry-season-4-scripts-finished/">Per Ethan Anderton on <em>SlashFilm</em>, quoting Bill Hader:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Right when the lockdown happened in March, we were a week away from shooting. So the last time I was in a room with a lot of people was the table read episodes one and two of season three, and we were ready to go. Then it all got shut down. Season three is completely written, ready to go, and then during this time we actually went and wrote season four. So we have both of those kinda done. We’re just waiting until we can start shooting again.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Barry” is a <em> sui generis</em> example of peak TV. It takes a lot of risks in terms of both plot and tone, and so far they have all paid off. I certainly couldn’t predict how Bill Hader and Alex Berg were going to write their way out of the end of Season 2 of “Barry,” but I guess they cracked it and then some.</p>

<p>The “American carnage” that Donald Trump vowed to end at the dawn of his presidency was revived in terrifying, treacherous form at its sunset Wednesday, as Trump made a fiery last stand and incited his supporters to storm and sack the U.S. Capitol as part of an attempted coup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t even know how to comment on this event without seeming glib, but I feel compelled to say something anyway.</p>

<p>I am, by trade, an auditor. One thing auditors are trained to investigate is called “tone at the top,” which represents the values expressed by the top management of a company which are expected from everyone who reports up to them.</p>

<p>After auditing for years, I have discovered that “tone at the top” is almost everything you need to know about an organization to get an idea how well and how ethically it is operated. Ethics and decency from the top of an organization really do trickle down all the way to the bottom and permeate it entirely. Moreover, they are strongly indicative of the organization’s *solvency*—its ability to hold together as a going concern over time.</p>

<p>When the “tone at the top” is selfish, vain, petty, petulant, aggrieved, unethical, amoral, and violent—as Trump’s has been—that tone trickles down to the whole organization, and pollutes the thoughts and corrupts the actions of the people within it. Unfortunately in this case, the “organization” is not just the Executive Branch, not just the federal government, and not just the Republican Party: it is the entire United States of America. What’s more, because the U.S. is a vastly influential country, the corruption and willful deceit at the head of it spills over into the rest of the world.</p>

<p>I feel like I have known this from the beginning—before the slow-moving coup even started—because I understood what the “tone at the top” was, and knew that it was vitally important. <em>Knowing</em> this, sadly, is not enough, because in a democracy a majority of people need to know this for things to turn out better. Being <em>able</em> to know this, like being able to discern the “tone at the top” as a new auditor, is a rare gift. It requires a trait that is not easily acquired, but is so difficult to teach and to learn that it is often considered to be innate: <em>shrewdness</em>.</p>

<p>That’s because “tone at the top” isn’t always as blatantly obvious as Trump’s vitriolic tweets and shambolic rally speeches. Understanding what the “tone at the top” <em>really</em> is, it requires a combination of healthy skepticism, decent powers of observation, and the knowledge of how things are supposed to work. You have to understand both context <em>and</em> subtext; subtext is much harder to grasp than context, but is often the more important to the two. You have to interpret people’s words <em>and</em> actions, and compare them to each other to see if the actions follow the words. You also have to have some kind of ethical foundation—which may be laws of the state, societal norms, or virtue ethics— on which to base your conclusions.</p>

<p>The human mind has evolved to do a lot of this analysis automatically. Consider that establishing whether you trust another person is, and always has been, an essential part of human interaction. But, like a lot of thought processes that are largely automatic, many times mental shortcuts are taken and the wrong choice is made. To be able to second-guess these automatic thought processes takes intellect, some degree of guidance, and a willingness to think a little harder.</p>

<p>I would not be surprised to learn that many of the people trying to unlawfully overturn the election—not counting the elected officials who are operating out of cynical self-interest—really do think they are making an ethical decision, and really do think they are doing the right thing. They just trusted the wrong person, or made the wrong decision about voting for or supporting, because they lack the shrewdness and imagination to discern that the “tone at the top” really does matter, and that bad words from a lazy president really will lead to riots in the streets.</p>

<p>I realized today that in, ACL, a scripting language I use at work, I have been using a mixture of <code>PascalCase</code> and <code>snake_case</code> (like this: <code>Table_Name</code>) that is the worst of both worlds in terms of typing difficulty. Fortunately, ACL is not case-sensitive.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of <a href="https://medium.com/[@kevinrose](https://micro.blog/kevinrose)/introducing-zero-a-new-app-to-help-you-fast-209935e8245d">the Zero app</a>, which is a tracker for intermittent fasting. It is free, attractive, and has just enough features to keep me engaged and motivated, and no more.</p>

<p>Currently, my favorite feature is its Apple Watch complication, which fills up a ring (similar to the Activity app’s rings) as you progress through your fasting period. I find that filling that ring every day, and the app&rsquo;s cheerful notifications every morning, really help motivate me to stop snacking or having an extra meal at night.</p>

<p>The only thing I don&rsquo;t like about it is that it requires you to set up an account with an email address. While the company behind it does not appear to be abusing my privacy in any way, I would prefer that they didn’t require an account. Perhaps they will adopt Sign in with Apple when it becomes available this fall.</p>

<p>If you are interested in Zero, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zero-fasting-tracker/id1168348542?mt=8">download it from the iOS App Store</a>.</p>

<h1 id="thoughts-on-apple-card">Thoughts on Apple Card</h1>

<p>I got the Apple Card about a week ago, and just started using it this weekend. Here are some initial thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li>I very much like the security and privacy features Apple Pay and the Apple Card. I try to use Apple Pay whenever I can to take advantage of most of these features, no matter what card I was using.</li>
<li>I very much like the enhancements to the Wallet app on my iPhone to review transactions and spending.</li>
<li>2% cash back on all Apple Pay purchases seems like a pretty good benefit to me.</li>
<li>3% back on Apple transactions seems a little stingy, considering that Amazon and Target offer 5% back when you use their branded cards. I would get a much better cash-back rate buying an Apple product on Amazon, using my Amazon.com Visa.</li>
<li>The interest rate offered to me was the lowest that they offer, and it is a between two and three percentage points lower than the other cards I have. I never carry a balance, so it doesn’t mean much to me.</li>
<li>I had a false-alarm fraud alert shortly after I set it up. I made it my default on my Apple account, and a $30 annual subscription fee trigged a fraud alert. I contacted Apple Card support via iMessage, and cleared up the problem.</li>
<li>Buying different things changes the color of the card in the Wallet app, which is amusing. The colors correspond to the spending charts.</li>
<li>I had a lot of trouble adding the card to my Apple Watch. It took lots of fiddling with settings, but, fortunately, I did not have to unpair and repair the Apple Watch to my iPhone.</li>
<li>The titanium card is boring and heavy. I expect to never use it. Its best feature is that my card number is not printed on it.</li>
<li>Some common features are missing: a website, integration with personal finance applications, and joint accounts (or authorized users).</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="ready-player-one-by-ernest-cline">📚 Ready Player One, by Ernest Cline</h1>

<p>Earlier this year, I completed reading _<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One">Ready Player One</a>_ by Ernest Cline. It was the first novel that I had read in a while, as I have been reading mostly nonfiction in recent years. I discovered the book from an <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/triangulation/episodes/322">episode of the “Triangulation” podcast in which Leo Laporte interviewed author Andy Weir</a>, who enthusiastically recommended the book.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed the book. The prose is efficient and the pacing is swift. I thought it started out strong, and I liked the world building and the build-up of suspense in the early chapters. After a while, though, I tired of all the 1980s video game and movie references, and wanted the book to end. While I was about three quarters through the book, I referred to it as “the reading equivalent to watching somebody else play video games”. For me, the stakes felt too low, and the characterizations were too thin, to make a lasting impression. Still, I had fun reading it, at least most of the way through.</p>

<h1 id="introducing-the-new-yorker-crossword-puzzle">Introducing The New Yorker Crossword Puzzle</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/crossword/puzzles-dept/2018/04/30">The New Yorker just launched a crossword puzzle</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of our readers have e-mail addresses now, and the Web has given us the space to try new things—and to try old things again. In that spirit, we’re launching another crossword, online this time, and in the American style. It’ll be weekly, just like the magazine: a new one every Monday morning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am a daily crossword puzzle player. I enjoy them, though I am not terribly good at them, because I love word games and have read that crosswords help keep your mind sharp into old age.</p>

<p>The New Yorker puzzle is a <em>tiny</em> bit more challenging than I would like (as I said, I’m not a strong player), but I’m happy there’s another source of crossword puzzles (beyond the New York Times, which I also subscribe to) coming may way.</p>

<p>I hope they will someday move it into their iOS app. The scrolling behavior, which affects the on-page keyboard, is annoying on mobile.</p>

<h1 id="prolific-apple-supply-chain-analyst-ming-chi-kuo-departs-kgi-securities-likely-to-focus-on-companies-other-than-apple">Prolific Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo departs KGI Securities, likely to focus on companies other than Apple</h1>

<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/30/prolific-apple-supply-chain-analyst-ming-chi-kuo-departs-kgi/">Kuo’s departure</a> comes hot off the heels of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/13/apple-memo-on-leaks-leaks/">Apple’s recent “leaked” memo</a> about leaking that threatened the leaky leaders who leak.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why has Ming-Chi Kuo, arguably one of the most popular technology analysts in the world, decided to move on? One possible reason is that his sources have done likewise, or perhaps have even been removed in light of Apple’s recent memo and strong stance against leaks — supply chain or otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wondered why myself, and figured that Apple has either threatened him, or his sources, with criminal lawsuits. I, for one, wouldn’t mind if Apple finally closed up all the leaks in its supply chain. While these leaks may benefit Apple investors, they don’t really benefit Apple fans that much.</p>

<h1 id="how-we-got-to-now">How We Got To Now</h1>

<p>I recently finished reading Steen Johnson’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/28/books/review/how-we-got-to-now-by-steven-johnson.html">How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World</a>. It was a breezy and pleasurable read, full of interesting information. Johnson’s writing is clear, concise, and engaging throughout.</p>

<p>As a huge nerd who spent a lot of time in childhood perusing a science and technology encyclopedia, and a lot of time in my teens watching tech-related documentaries on Discovery and TLC (before those networks drifted to reality TV), I already knew a lot of the material. Still, it’s a wonderful read to anyone who loves the “history of ideas course” way of looking at disparate, seemingly unrelated things in everyday life, and drawing a through line that connects them all. Plus I learned new phrases that describe these unintended and intended technological and cultural developments—“hummingbird effects” and “the adjacent possible”—that I particularly like.</p>

<h1 id="i-miss-caesar-salad">I miss Caesar salad</h1>

<p>It seems to me that massive outbreaks of food borne illness are becoming more and more common. That <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-outbreak-worsens-98-people-now-sick-n869681">our current, worsening outbreak</a> is the <em>second</em> E. Coli outbreak tied to my favorite type of lettuce in the past six months or so, and it is so virulent, is making me feel worried about our food system, and pessimistic about my country’s will to improve it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An outbreak of E. coli food poisoning linked to romaine lettuce has widened and has now made at least 98 people sick, federal health officials said Friday.</p>

<p>More than half have had to be hospitalized because the strain of E. coli causing this outbreak is an especially nasty one, the officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said.</p>

<p>People in 22 states have reported E. coli infections linked to the outbreak, the CDC and FDA said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m no expert in this, but I feel like we have several problems in our food system that have, in the past few decades, started to compound in dangerous ways that we should have seen coming. Some of these problems include overcrowding of animals, overuse of antibiotics in livestock, and over-concentration in production and processing. When bad hygiene infects food, it’s worse now than it used to be. The bacteria are more resistant to antibiotics, and the food, and food borne illness, is distributed all across the country.</p>

<p>Another annoyance to me, as a someone who has eaten some raw eggs (usually in cookie dough or homemade eggnog) and rare meat over the years, is that I have <em>never</em> gotten a food borne illness from those activities. I have, however, gotten terribly ill several times from eating restaurant salads, probably due to unwashed hands or vegetables. There are menu warnings about undercooked meat in every restaurant I go to, but none about the danger of eating unwashed vegetables.</p>

<p>I am impatiently awaiting the day I can eat Caesar salads again.</p>

<p>While I was on vacation, I wrote a series of blog posts about all my old speaker systems. My goal was to trace my journey from a normal person to an audiophile, as I upgrade my gear up over the years.</p>

         	<p>Phew! I finally fixed a bug that bedeviled me for days. (Well, <em>nights</em>, because it is in my hobby project.) The fix was adding two lines of <em>very basic</em> code to a function that hasn&rsquo;t been touched in years. I think the Swift compiler changed something about implicit protocol compliance, and it caused the function to stop processing the intended read/write logic for one of my protocol data types. I&rsquo;m rewriting that library to not need that function anymore, and must code some better tests for it than I did before.</p>

<p>Now I can go back to writing the fun, <em>new</em> library that will make my code much easier to deal with going forward.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/04/30/apple-is-poised.html">Apple is Poised to Lose its Antitrust Battle</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/04/30/apple-is-poised.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-04-30 12:07:28 -0400">Apr 30, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I think that Apple is going to lose whatever antitrust cases are eventually brought against it in the EU and in the US. I don’t actually think Apple <em>should</em> lose, because I don’t think it is correct to call Apple a monopoly.</p>

<p>The general antitrust argument against Apple is that its App Store platform is too locked down, and that is unfair because Apple is a monopoly (insert eye roll here) of its own platform. App is a platform owner. Of course it has a “monopoly” over the platform it owns. That doesn’t make it a monopoly in the overall marketplace. Moreover, while iOS is undoubtedly popular, it is a <em>minority</em> smartphone platform, which in the broadest legal terms that I understand, makes monopoly-related antitrust law not apply to them.</p>

<p>App developers have to accept Apple’s terms, and pay a pretty large commission to Apple, to distribute apps in the store or to take in-app purchases. That may not feel fair to developers, but I can’t take seriously the arguments that it is illegal. It is the same way that game consoles work. Will we go after Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft next? Shouldn’t they open up their game consoles to alternative payment systems and alternate app stores, too? I have heard of no one seriously arguing this.</p>

<p>The most compelling argument against Apple’s App Store requirements is that Apple demands too much money from developers for distribution and payment solutions that other companies now offer at lower prices. I am sympathetic to this argument because I too think Apple should have lowered its commission over the years, as marginal costs for these technologies and services have declined. However, the size of Apple’s cut is not really at issue here. Apple, rather clumsily, lowered its commission for a majority of its developers to 15%, starting in January 2021, but the antitrust talk just keeps rolling on.</p>

<p>The second most compelling argument against Apple is that it uses its platform-owner advantage to position its own software and services over third-party competitors. Again, I sympathize. Apple Sherlocks developers sometimes, and can position its own software and services over anyone else’s. So does Microsoft (ever use Windows?). Amazon exercises a tremendous advantage over third party sellers in its online marketplace.</p>

<p>I could argue that even Linux vendors, such as Ubuntu, position their own, preferred software over that of third-party developers. Software platform owners always have advantages over third parties that operate on their platform. Extracting as much value from that as is possible is the entire point of creating and owning a platform. I think it only becomes an antitrust problem when a company has majority market share, which Apple does not have.</p>

<p>If developers can’t accept Apple’s terms, then they shouldn’t. They should develop for Android instead, which has the majority market share anyway, or create progressive web apps. (Remember, the web is an app platform, too, not just a way to collect credit card payments for software.) If developers “need” to develop for iOS because iOS users, on average, spend way more money on apps than Android users, then that just shows the value Apple’s marketplace has, and <em>is</em> worth paying for.</p>

<p>Despite my views, I still think Apple is poised to lose any legal actions about them regarding monopoly. It won’t lose based on the merits of whatever case is brought against it; it will lose because enough political sentiment is against Apple, at least in this area, and that is all that matters. Perhaps all the tech giants will fall under this scrutiny, and all will be forced to open up their platforms more widely, and will be forced to renounce their first-party advantage when distributing applications and features. I just don’t see that actually happening, and if it does happen, I don’t think it will benefit anybody in the way government regulators would expect. It could even stifle the development of the next generation of technology platforms.</p>

<p>I set up a new RGB color scheme and remapped my CapsLock to Control, saved them to the keyboard’s local profile, and (out of habit) configured the Zeus Engine to <em>not</em> start every time I log on. I plugged my keyboard into my USB hub and will keep my fingers crossed that it will work reliably now.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know anything in particular about Apple’s plans, but it seems crazy to me to expect a faster chip at this time. What I would expect is more I/O, driven by more cores and supported by more RAM. Of course, I could be wrong. Maybe Apple can overvolt the M1 to get more speed out of it, and will call it by another name.</p>

<p>Microsoft is changing its default Office font next year and wants everyone to help pick the new default.

<p>I am unusually attached to Calibri so I am not looking forward to this change. Then again, at work I often have to publish using Arial Narrow, which I think is objectively awful in terms of aesthetics and legibility, so it probably won’t affect me too much.</p>

It is a puzzle game where you, essentially, build a machine with various component parts to move a ball (well, the game calls it a “binary cell”) from one part of the screen to another. It sounds simple, and it starts out fairly simple, but it becomes very challenging as you progress. It’s the sort of game a programmer, or anyone who enjoyed <em><a href="https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine">Human Resource Machine</a></em> would enjoy.</p>

         	<p>I am delighted that I discovered a video game that is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/fez-switch/">new to the Nintendo Switch</a>, but not at all new to the world, called <a href="http://www.fezgame.com">Fez</a>. This is the game’s official blurb:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gomez is a 2D creature living in a 2D world. Or is he? When the existence of a mysterious 3rd dimension is revealed to him, Gomez is sent out on a journey that will take him to the very end of time and space. Use your ability to navigate 3D structures from 4 distinct classic 2D perspectives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is a 2D puzzle platformer where your character can rotate the environment left or right 90 degrees at a time, but you always interact with the environment in two dimensions. Some of the puzzles are quite challenging, but I think that the most hidden secrets that you can get from solving the hardest puzzles are all optional to completing the game. It’s a charming game, and easily my favorite Switch game of this year so far.</p>

It seems like not a day goes by without a <em>New York Times</em> news alert about it. (I plan to turn those alerts off after I finish writing this.) This time, a gunman killed seven people, then himself. This detail about the story jumped out at me: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/16/us/indianapolis-fedex-shooting#shooting-at-a-fedex-warehouse-in-indianapolis-leaves-8-dead">The shooting likely lasted one or two minutes</a>.”</p>

<p>I think the news media covers mass shootings like they are exciting, like some kind of action movie where bad outcomes only happen to the extras, and the rest of us get to watch. But “one or two minutes” isn’t an action movie. It isn’t something exciting. It’s actually, really, really stupid. That such a thing is even possible, outside a war, is embarrassing and shameful to all of us. I wish it were more widely considered to be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kuo says that next year Apple will drop the 5.4-inch model and run with two 6.1-inch models instead, one Pro, one regular.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This rumor is a prime reason I upgraded to the iPhone 12 mini early this year. I absolutely love the size and weight of it. It fits better in my hands and in my pockets than my iPhone 7 Plus ever did. However, the 12 mini’s small screen size makes it less compelling to read on, edit photos on, or watch videos on. These are all things I do pretty much every day without complaint, but if it were going to be my only portable device I would have bought one with a bigger screen.</p>

<p>I have no desire to go back to a larger phone, because the phone, for me, is one tool among many, rather than the center of my computing universe. It doesn’t have to be compelling, just useful. It doesn’t have to be used constantly, just when it makes the most sense to.</p>

<p>Some time from now, I think the smartphone, as a thing I carry around all the time, and as the default “Internet communication device,” is going to disappear and be replaced by something else: smart glasses maybe, or some kind of earpiece (when I am really old and need hearing aides).</p>

<p>Microsoft is refreshing its Surface lineup with the Surface Laptop 4 today, which now offers the choice between AMD or Intel processors across both the 13.5- and 15-inch models. Both sizes will ship with Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors or AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series processors. Microsoft is shipping its Surface Laptop 4 on April 15th in the US, Canada, and Japan, starting at $999 for the AMD model and $1,299 for the Intel version — a $300 price gap between the pair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I was more of a Windows guy I would probably buy only Microsoft-brand laptops at this point. They don’t always have the best specs, but I like their designs a lot.</p>

<p>I spend most of my computing time using Windows for work. I try to forget that I have a Lenovo laptop by putting it behind a giant monitor and using an external keyboard and trackball to operate it. Lenovo laptops are good, I guess, as long as I don’t have to touch them. I don’t like their keyboards (both in terms of layout and feel) or the pointing devices (the trackpad is too small, and I’m done with using the trackpoint/eraserhead thing). The Surface Laptops keyboards and trackpads have always seemed a lot more sensible to me in how they are designed.</p>

I actually learned something new from it: People use the funnel, which is meant to help put your coffee grounds into the press without making a mess, to brew coffee into cups with mouths too small for the bottom of the AeroPress. I have to try that! He also states in the video that the AeroPress is easy to make good coffee from, but is difficult to master. I actually put very little effort into my AeroPress use—far less than I used to when I first starting using it. I have found that my AeroPress brewing technique, no matter how sloppy or lazy, doesn’t seem to affect my coffee all that much. It prefer not stressing about it anymore.</p>

I have a Celeron based PC doing that for me now, but it runs hot and can be noisy, too. If a machine can run Linux, it extends its lifespan considerably for me.</p>

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/04/09/relearning-how-to.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-04-09 00:28:18 -0400">Apr 9, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Yesterday I turned off the <a href="https://flashquark.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AnnePro2_UserManual_en.pdf">tap layer on my Anne Pro 2 keyboard</a> which is basically only for using <code>Fn</code>, <code>Fn2</code>. right-<code>Ctrl</code>, and right <code>Swift</code> keys as arrow keys. (The keyboard does not have dedicated arrow keys.)</p>

<p>I did this because I think the tap layer causes me a lot of problems, like the cursor moving up a line when I just meant to press the <code>Shift</code> key for its normal function. I also think it may be contributing to double keypresses somehow, but it could also be that I am still not used to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/7de612/kailh_box_white_review/">Khial Box White switches</a>, which have a different actuation point than the Cherry MX Blues I usually type on.</p>

<p>Now, I am trying to get used to typing <code>Fn</code> + WASD for arrow keys. It&rsquo;s not too bad, but it makes some keyboard shortcuts in Visual Studio Code, like &ldquo;expand selection&rdquo; (<code>Ctrl</code>+<code>Alt</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>Right Arrow</code>, which is now<code>Fn</code>+<code>D</code>) almost impossible to pull off. I even started looking into switching to <a href="https://www.vim.org">Vim</a> or a Vim-mode plugin for Visual Studio Code, so I didn&rsquo;t have to use arrow keys at all. I gave up Vim pretty quickly, though. I know enough Vim to exit it (ha!) and edit config files, and that&rsquo;s more than enough usage for me right now.</p>

<p>All in all, my typing has been more accurate since turning off the tap layer, but I have also had to think about how to use the arrow keys each time I use <code>Fn</code>+WASD, especially if there are other modifier keys involved. I have found myself using the mouse a lot more for text selection and navigation than I am used to, which is reminding me of how I used a Macintosh at school when I was a kid.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I wasted an hour last night trying to install <a href="https://qmk.fm">QMK firmware</a> on my work computer’s mechanical keyboard, a <a href="https://www.durgod.com/page9?product_id=47&amp;_l=en">Durgod Taurus K320</a>. I have a love/hate relationship with it. I love that it has the best build quality, rigidity, stabilization, keycaps, and typing feel and sound of any of the many (many!) keyboards I have owned over the years. I hate that its software is buggy: so buggy that sometimes the keyboard hangs and I have to unplug it to fix it; so buggy that I have to plug it in directly to my laptop rather than through a USB hub; so buggy that that I cannot program its layers the way I want to.</p>

<p>Very recently, someone figured out how to run QMK firmware on it, which could resolve the stability and customizability problems I have with the board. Unfortunately, I was not able to figure out how to flash the firmware to the keyboard. The main problem I faced was that the keyboard was not recognized by the QMK Toolkit software (on Windows) even after I put the keyboard into bootloader mode, and even after I started messing with the bootloader firmware using <a href="https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/guides/driver_installation_zadig">Zadig</a>.</p>

<p>After lots of tries, I couldn’t figure out. I think I dodged a bullet, though, because I’m not sure QMK can control the RGB backlighting, which, on this keyboard, is necessary to see the key legends. Fortunately, despite me trying to mess with it, my keyboard still works as well as it did before. It’s not perfect, and I really would like to create a more robust <code>Fn</code> (function key) layer, but I will live with it for now.</p>

         	<p>Today I made the mistake to look up someone I knew while I was in high school. I was reading an article about illegal drugs, and thought about a high school friend’s younger brother who ran into some drug problems about 20 years ago. Sadly, I discovered that he died last year. I can only conjecture, but it seems, based on what else happened to him over the past few years, that drug problems led to his premature death. Learning about what happened to him made me very sad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple’s gaming subscription service just got a massive influx of new titles. The headliner is Fantasian — the latest release from the creator of Final Fantasy — which is joined by other titles like new versions of NBA 2K and The Oregon Trail, and World of Demons from PlatinumGames. As part of the update, the service is getting two new categories of games: Apple calls them “Timeless Classics” and “App Store Greats.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I literally just canceled my (second) Apple Arcade free trial twelve hours before this announcement. I just can’t seem to get into Apple Arcade at all. For the most part, the reason is that I find my iPhone 12 mini to be too small to be a compelling gaming device. Secondarily, I don’t want to get into a complex, involved game on my iPhone or iPad. I prefer my mobile games to be simple things that can be jumped into and out of, more like the “Timeless Classics” that Apple is now adding to Apple Arcade. It’s too bad for Apple Arcade that I already own almost all of those games.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Federal health officials gave the green light Friday for fully vaccinated people to resume travel as an estimated 100 million Americans have had at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine, and evidence mounts of the shots’ effectiveness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s good news, but it doesn’t make me want to go out and travel by plane or train anytime soon.</p>

<p>I am fully vaccinated, but my kids are not (because, of course, there is no approved vaccine for children yet), and that dramatically limits my desire to travel, eat in indoor restaurants, or do any indoor activities in public unless they are absolutely necessary. I understand that it is probably quite safe for me to do some of these activities (provided I wear a mask, etc.), but it seems to me that doing so would still be (even more) uncomfortable and unpleasant (than it was before).</p>

<p>My wife and I have been talking every day about what is OK or not OK for us to do now that we are vaccinated. Despite both being vaccinated, we are still not comfortable dining in restaurants or staying in hotels (don’t even talk about flying!), but we have realized that we are way behind our friends and acquaintances in terms of risk taking. We remain concerned about our children being explored to the virus, and about the rising and “extremely high” (per <em>The New York Times</em>) COVID-19 risk level our county is currently at. It just doesn’t make sense for us to change our behavior that much yet—at least not until the local COVID infection numbers go down quite a bit, which won’t happen until after a lot more people get vaccinated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best-known AI text-generator is OpenAI’s GPT-3, which the company recently announced is now being used in more than 300 different apps, by “tens of thousands” of developers, and producing 4.5 billion words per day. That’s a lot of robot verbiage. This may be an arbitrary milestone for OpenAI to celebrate, but it’s also a useful indicator of the growing scale, impact, and commercial potential of AI text generation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The obvious industry target for auto-text is journalism. It is already being used there for sports reporting, and could probably be used for local government reporting too. There are other areas it will encroach on that are news-adjacent (think financial news or business book digest services like Blinkist), like education and entertainment.</p>

<p>I’m an auditor, and I think that, eventually, auto-text is going to destroy about 50% of our billable hours. Auditors spend a <em>ton</em> of time writing. We document our procedures. We record our work. We summarize our findings. We write reports for our clients. Making sense of all the work, both for our own understanding and for our client’s, for the sake of writing it down, takes a lot of time. Moreover, the simple act of typing it out and, especially, hyperlinking everything together so we support our conclusions, requires a lot of manual work. Some of this work is communicative, but a lot of it (like the hyperlinking part) is mechanical. Consequently, much of it is ripe for automation.</p>

<p>I think, though, that transforming this laborious and time-consuming writing process into something auto-generated by a bot would produce a lot more <em>information</em> but a lot less <em>knowledge</em> than we had before. You gain a lot more understanding how a company, business process, or control works by writing about it than by reading about it. Why? Because writing is <em>thinking</em>. To write well is mentally strenuous. It requires you to think how you would communicate an idea to someone else, notably someone else with a different perspective and different knowledge than you have. At the end of the writing process, you should understand your subject backwards and forwards and from all sides; you could probably describe it in a number of different ways; and you will likely remember the gist of it, and specific nuances about it, for far longer than you would if you had just read about it in a report.</p>

<p>The world won’t end, and few will shed tears, when AI writes audit reports and work papers. Audits cost money, and businesses mostly don’t think they benefit from them. If it makes the auditors less knowledgeable, however, side effects will develop, and those will be long-lasting. Knowledgable auditors help make good control environments possible, which leads to more stable and more solvent companies. Decreasing the understanding of auditors could make systems and processes more unstable and less trustworthy over time. Additionally, knowledgable auditors often move to the business side and go on to manage well-controlled organizations. While the auditor-to-manager career path will likely continue, such moves would not result in the same level of management quality if the auditors don’t have to think as deeply about what they are auditing as they did before the AI text-bots took over. Neither of these side effects bodes particularly well for the people the auditors and the audited companies (and their fancy AI) serve.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I watched episode one of <a href="https://www.marvel.com/tv-shows/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier/1"><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a> this week. It’s a show about two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe">MCU</a> characters I don’t particularly care that much about, so it wasn’t something I was really looking forward to, but I pay for Disney+ anyway and thought I may as well check it out. Reader, I liked it!</p>

<p>My first impression is that it looks like it cost a zillion dollars. Special-effects-wise, it looks on par with the Marvel movies. Based on that alone, I could see why Disney originally wanted it to premiere first, before <em>WandaVision</em> and whatever other Marvel shows are being developed.</p>

<p>My second impression is that I appreciated that it was trying to tell a Black story as well as a super hero story. I am not optimistic that Sam’s (The Falcon’s) family side story is going to be anything but predictable, but it is nice to see an attempt to give the character some grounding in reality. Race is an issue that touches everything in American life, unfortunately. In some ways, it would be disrespectful to Sam’s character and to the audience not to address that in some way.</p>

<p>I don’t have anything bad to say about the Winter Soldier part of the show, but it isn’t as interesting to me. I expect it to follow a predictable “antihero almost, but doesn’t quite, make good” formula, but maybe the writers will surprise me.</p>

<p>Predictability aside, I’m just glad to have something new and fun to watch.</p>

         	<p>I was thinking about creating a training presentation to help my coworkers with keyboards shortcuts, but was dismayed to see that our Lenovo laptop keyboards (which I never use, because I work from home and use external peripherals) don’t even have a menu key. Someone decided that <code>Print Screen</code> was more important, which may even be true, but it doesn’t help me make a good presentation for my coworkers. The menu key alternative, <code>Shift+F10</code> is going to be a very hard sell, especially because <code>F10</code> on the laptop requires the <code>Fn</code> key to be pressed, too.</p>

<p>I have gone from someone who did not use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_key">menu key</a> on my keyboard for 20+ years (since it was invented in the 1990s) to someone who can’t live without it (on my Windows at least). I made it a point to start using it a few months ago, and now I use it constantly. I recommend that all Windows users with an ANSI or ISO keyboard layout check it out. That key is positioned right underneath your thumb when you use the arrow keys.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I was not I initially interested at all in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Snyder%27s_Justice_League">Snyder Cut of <em>Justice League</em></a> but I ended up watching it anyway, over two nights. I’m glad I did.</p>

<p>I thought the theatrical release of <em>Justice League</em> was pretty bad, but not quite as bad as the professional movie review consensus was. I figured that the Snyder cut must be better, but I was surprised at how much better it is. Granted, it still isn’t <em>good</em>. It doesn’t fix its pacing problems. It still is not as brisk and pleasurable as the best of the Marvel movies. It doesn’t tell a cohesive story, but it also crams in too many story lines for a non-DC fan to keep track of. It still has some dumb script problems, such every single part of the nonsensical museum height/terrorist bombing blot in the opening Wonder Woman scene, that could have been solved by editing a few sentences of dialog. While not exactly <em>good</em>, it is a good bad movie now. Its reach often exceeds its grasp, but it offers a lot of interesting material to people who are already fans. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to be the kind of movie that would bring a lot new fans in.</p>

<p>It is now very clear to me that Zach Snyder’s vision was dark and wild and weird—definitely too much of all of those things to launch a successful franchise—but Joss Whedon’s contributions were just awful: tasteless, asinine, nonsensical, and insulting to the audience. Whedon’s dialog (notably Superman’s and The Flash’s) and the character moments he created, like the race between The Flash and Superman, are embarrassing to watch and make the characters seem stupid. Snyder’s cut simply had better dialog for them. Simply getting rid of the random <em>people</em> that Whedon put into that nuclear wasteland Russian city—the one that existed in the movie only to be destroyed in a bout of cinematic excess—made the climax bearable. Who needs to worry about a family who shouldn’t be living in a nuclear wasteland anyway when the entire world is already at stake? Whedon really did screw up that movie.</p>

<p>I think that the Snyder Cut works very well for fans of the comics, especially fans of the “what-if” versions of all the famous characters. Some fans, like me, believe that comic book characters are archetypes, and really can be <em>anything</em>, and no representation of them is truly canonical. The grim, dark version of the Justice League is an interesting thought experiment, one of many worth exploring. It is not something I ever felt hung up on as “not the real version” of Superman or whatever. The Snyder Cut isn’t the real version of the DC Universe to me, because nothing is. It’s all just ideas and entertainment anyway.</p>

That creates something very similar to Mac’s <code>Command+Q</code> shortcut to Windows.</p>

<p>The default Windows keyboard shortcut for quitting an app is <code>Alt+F4</code>, which is a two hand operation for me. Note that in AutoHotKey, you don’t even need to send that key command; you can use the WinClose function instead:</p>

<pre><code>#q::  
WinClose, A  
Return  
</code></pre>

<p>One of the best things Apple has ever done with their support of keyboard shortcuts was to pretend that function keys (<code>F1</code> through <code>F12</code>) don’t exist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the company’s “Engineering the Future” announcement today, Gelsinger announced plans to outsource more of Intel’s chip production to third-party foundries; a $20 billion investment into two new fabs in Arizona; and a new branch of the company called Intel Foundry Services, which will see Intel’s foundries produce chips for other companies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intel has had an awful decade, having missed out on smartphone chips and having stalled out at their 14nm process for years. Still, it is a strategically important company for my country, and I have to ill will toward it, even if I don’t prefer their products right now. I would love to see them become competitive again.</p>

<p>The idea of Intel fabbing chips for other companies is a big deal. Intel has never done that before. It seems to me like it could be the first step of spinning off that part of the business into its own company, and focusing on process shrinks in ways that the fully integrated Intel could not before.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Josh Berlinger of <em>CNN</em> reports today that <a href="http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_d3f4ea80ea0d81acb5d30fcf939c3243">the Colorado attack is the 7th mass shooting in 7 days in the US</a>.</p>

<p>It seemed like there were periods in recent years in which we had a deadly mass shooting in the national news at least every week, if not several times each week. There has been something of a pause due to COVID, for understandable reasons. Unfortunately, we seem to be un-pausing now. Sadly, mass shooting rates in the U.S. seem to be getting back to normal.</p>

<p>But what is “normal?” It is actually hard to know what is normal for gun violence in the U.S. Here’s an interesting factoid from the article about my country’s gun problem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear how this number of mass shootings compares to an average week in the US.</p>

<p>Though some official gun violence data is available, the US federal government does not have a centralized system or database to track firearm incidents and mass shootings nationwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks some gun violence data, nearly 40,000 people were killed in incidents involving firearms in 2019.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article omits the reason for this: There are actually <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-government-study-gun-violence/story?id=50300379">laws against government agencies, such as the CDC, accurately tracking gun violence</a>. That’s just stupid and self-defeating. While dying due to gun violence is incredibly unlikely, statistically speaking, it is also completely unnecessary. We should treat <a href="https://usafacts.org/data/topics/security-safety/crime-and-justice/firearms/firearm-deaths/">all gun deaths</a> as <em>preventable</em> and <em>unacceptable</em>. Only then can we have the mental and moral clarity to do something about it.</p>

<li>Make every command accessible via a hardware keyboard shortcut. (I’m thinking mainly of the iPad version.)</li>
<li>Add a command palette, like Visual Studio Code and Sublime Text have.</li>
<li>Support <a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/">Mermaid</a>, a text-based markup language for creating flowcharts, in fenced code blocks, like <a href="https://typora.io">Typora</a> does.</li>

         	<p><a href="https://text.npr.org/978608714">As Anya Kamenetz, Cory Turner, and Allison Aubrey report on the <em>NPR</em> website today</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its guidance for schools. On Friday, the agency announced it &ldquo;now recommends that, with universal masking, students should maintain a distance of at least 3 feet in classroom settings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Previously the guidance stated, &ldquo;Physical distancing (at least 6 feet) should be maximized to the greatest extent possible.&rdquo; The new guidelines still call for 6 feet of distance between adults and students as well as in common areas, such as auditoriums, and when masks are off, such as while eating. And the 6-foot distancing rule still applies for the general public in settings such as grocery stores.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This news is causing a good deal of consternation in my family. COVID cases are going up in our local schools right now. There has been an extremely high risk level in the community for several weeks, and in-person instruction is expanding anyway. Our school systems have been flatly stating that they will open even though they cannot conform with some of the requirements. This change in CDC requirements makes it easier for them to comply.</p>

<p>I think the changing of, and complexity in, the distancing rules makes them seem suspect and less likely to be followed at all. This concern is counterbalanced, however, by my belief that distancing helps very little in the classroom, because every classroom I have seen has poor ventilation. My wife and I are keeping our kids remote until the end of the school year. We are still hopeful enough to consider September as the right time to send them back to in-person learning.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-new-ipad-pro-leaks-ahead-of-rumored-event/">Corinne Reichert and Stephen Shankland report in <em>CNET</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple will launch a series of new iPads in April, a report Wednesday said. The new iPad Pros will come with Apple&rsquo;s homemade M1 chips, a Thunderbolt port, and better cameras and screens, according to Bloomberg. They will reportedly come in 11- and 12.9-inch display sizes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s cool. Maybe I’m not a “Pro” but the iPad Air 4 is just about perfect for me. From my layman’s perspective, the A14-based chip in the iPad Air 4 is very similar to the M1, minus some of the cores. The 2020 iPad Pro’s chip (an A12Z) is a generation or two behind that, though it has more cores than the A14 does. Apple obviously needs to remedy that to help justify the iPad Pro’s greater price.</p>

<p>I am thinking that the “Thunderbolt” port is merely following the direction that everything with a USB-C connector is going in: USB 4 compatibility. That, plus more processor cores, sounds good for videographers, podcasters, photographers, and (I guess) gamers. Unfortunately, if Apple doesn’t fix some problems with the Files app (just try transferring a gigabyte-sized file off your iPad to a network share—I’ll wait&hellip;for it to fail), these performance boosts will be hamstrung.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>When it comes to creating effective PowerPoint presentations for work, my reach still exceeds my grasp.</p>

<p>I know a lot of important concepts, including the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>The slide deck is a visual aid, <em>not</em> the presentation</li>
<li>Focus on one idea per slide</li>
<li>Focus on very few visual elements/focus points per slide (e.g., five or six, maximum)</li>
<li>Light text on a dark background is easier on the eye</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, when I try to apply those ideas, I feel like I’m not getting anywhere. All of my slides look completely conventional: no better than those I created many years ago. I think they are effective, but they are ugly and boring. It does not help that I have to present on topics that are dry and technical in nature. I also feel hamstrung by my company’s PowerPoint template, which is quite busy, focuses attention on the wrong areas of the slide (i.e., the title and the footer), and has (almost completely) black text on a white background.</p>

<p>I think I need to invent a visual style that I can get away with on at least some of my slides:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full-bleed images that cover the entire slide, and obviate the need for titles or footers on my slides.</li>
<li>Text boxes that float over the images, or captions that fill in the top title area that is already part of our PowerPoint template.</li>
</ul>

<p>I just hope, if I do these things, my slides won’t end up looking like tired internet memes.</p>

         	<p>🎵 The Hold Steady’s latest album, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/open-door-policy/1539020630">Open Door Policy</a>, is growing on me. I know reviewers love it, because it is a return to form, but I was hoping for something different. It’s hard to say, what, though. Something that’s a mix of fun and depressing, like my favorite Hold Steady lyrics, I guess.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple has discontinued its original HomePod after four years. It says that it will continue to produce and focus on the HomePod mini, introduced last year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I, like many audiophiles, passed on the original HomePod due to its high price and lack of connectivity. I’m sure I would have enjoyed how it sounded, and its size is just right for me, but I would likely have had to buy two of them to be fully satisfied (stereo separation is important to me). At $349 each, that was too expensive.</p>

<p>The smaller, cheaper HomePod mini holds little appeal to me, and seems to be a far less interesting product for the audio engineers at Apple to work on. For all I know, though, it sells in huge numbers, which makes it interesting in and of itself. Maybe a HomePod mini max (ha!) will be released someday, at around $150, which will hit the price/performance sweet spot I am looking for.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I guess, based on the occurrence of a President Biden speech, that this week marks <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/Voices/2021/03/12/Joe-Biden-COVID-19-anniversary-speech-full-text/8161615555448/">the one-year anniversary of COVID-19 in the United States</a>. To me, the baleful presence of COVID-19 has been around for what feels like much, much longer—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic">so long that I can’t even remember it clearly</a>.</p>

<p>My COVID panic started in early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_January_2020">January</a>, when we thought the disease was only in Wuhan. In America, for a couple weeks at least, it still seemed likely that the disease would never leave China, much like H1N1 and SARS never made a big impact here. For almost three months my mental state caromed between what I think of now as irrational fear and rational fear. I could see the whole year of 2020 play out in my imagination, way before my friends and family could see what was coming, but I could do nothing to stop it, and I could do almost nothing to protect my family from it. All those feelings felt very real and very debilitating, even when almost no one else around me was feeling them.</p>

<p>I had about two months of angst about COVID before it actually hit around here. The last time I went out with friends and family was, I think, on March 14, 2020. We went to see a musical and when out to eat at a crowded restaurant afterward. It was really hard for me to feel comfortable the entire time, but I didn’t want to let everybody down because I was concerned about a pandemic that hadn’t hit our area yet. Less than a week later, my entire family was on lockdown.</p>

<p>Back in January, February, and early March 2020, it didn’t help me at all to have known about the scope and length and shape of prior pandemics, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu">Spanish Flu</a>, which I know, from reading family letters, killed a bunch of people in my extended family about a hundred years ago. It didn’t help me at all to know what I should do and buy to prepare for it. It didn’t help me at all that I am smart enough to think for myself and to scrutinize, with a pretty good understanding of the relevant science and statistics, the information and advice experts were providing to us. All of these things just made me feel more uncertain and more cynical about what was going on.</p>

<p>A year later, I am feeling more hopeful. I have the vaccine after all, and am probably (but not definitely) immune to COVID 18. But my <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/monmouth-new-jersey-covid-cases.html">county is still at extremely high risk level</a>. The numbers are still higher than they were last year when all of us were in a panic. Despite that, all the states, even blue states like mine, are reopening rapidly and throwing caution to the wind, when it would be more prudent to do so more gradually. It makes me nervous that we are giving the virus a chance to circulate long enough to adapt resistance to our vaccines.</p>

<p>I was early in being scared of COVID, and I may be late in getting over that fear. I just hope that, when I look forward from today, whatever fear I feel is merely anxiety over things that will not play out, rather than the accurate foresight into the future that I had late last winter.</p>

<p>The more Metroidvania games I play, the more I think that <em>Hollow Knight</em> is the best one ever. Platforming and combat are fast and fluid, it nails the difficulty curve,  it doesn&rsquo;t require grinding (unlike the Castlevania games), it allows for slow or fast play, and so on. I could go on and on about it.</p>

<p>Amanda Gorman is a strong and bold speaker, and deserves the last word on the matter:</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Tonight I learned about <a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/">Mermaid</a>, which is a plaintext markup language and renderer for creating flowcharts and other kinds of diagrams.</p>

<p>I want to make flowcharts quickly for my technical projects at work, but i don’t have Visio, and I hate fiddling with a GUI to line up shapes and worry about arrow lengths and so on. The way my mind works, I just want to type out what I want and have software figure out how to lay it out for me. I don’t care that much how it looks, as long as it is simple and makes sense.</p>

<p>Mermaid’s plaintext premise is really cool, and the syntax is flexible enough to not be awful. It is way more flexible than the examples on The Mermaid website originally led me to believe. You can name each shape whatever you like (not just single letter identifiers) and you can define the content (shapes) and relationships (arrows) separately if you want to.

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I watched “<a href="https://roosterteeth.com/series/gen-lock">Gen:lock</a>” over the past week. I was disappointed that it introduced a premise-breaking plot development in the penultimate episode. My beef is 100% spoiler-y.</p>

<p>The shows is a <a href="https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/tags/mecha">mecha anime</a>. Its premise is that, in some future war in which big robots piloted by people fight each other, a new type of mech is developed that is remotely controlled by very rare, very special kind of person. That person must bind her mind to the mech through a lot of hand-wavey technology called gen:lock.</p>

<p>The problem is, we learn three things in the final two episodes of season 1 that make the pilots unnecessary:</p>

<ol>
<li>A person’s mind can uploaded to, and downloaded from, a digital brain</li>
<li>A digital brain can be copied an indefinite number of times.</li>
<li>A digital brain is all that is needed to drive a mech</li>
</ol>

<p>If one pilot’s mind can be copied, without harming her, and then bound to any number of mechs, then why do we need the pilots at all, once you’ve got the first one’s mind copied? If the pilots aren’t really necessary, why haven’t the characters in charge of the gen:lock program figured that out yet?</p>

<p>I’m not sure I will pick it up again when season 2 comes out. Maybe this kind of anime isn’t for me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Why would a music streaming company and a financial services company join forces?!,” Dorsey posted on Twitter, posing the obvious question as he announced the news. “It comes down to a simple idea: finding new ways for artists to support their work. New ideas are found at intersections, and we believe there is a compelling one between music and the economy.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is great news if you&rsquo;re Jay-Z. He will cash out cash out with a tidy profit for his also-ran music service. I was surprised to learn that Tidal&rsquo;s value appreciated so much since he bought it.</p>

<p>It sure seems like a bad deal for Square, though, who accepts a ton of business risk without much benefit. I probably don&rsquo;t know what Tidal&rsquo;s cultural cache is—I had assumed that most people had never heard of it—so I can&rsquo;t appreciate its value. Still, even if the acquisition sounds like a bad idea, $300 million is play money to the Jay-Zs and Jack Dorseys of the world, so who cares?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But much of Tanden’s résumé was overshadowed by her proliferous online posting — at least 1,000 tweets raking both Republicans and leftist Democrats over the coals — that Tanden quietly started deleting in November 2020.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven’t been following this story, but my interest was piqued when I learned that Neera Tanden’s nomination chances were in jeopardy because of her tweets from the past. People keep getting in trouble for what they post to Twitter. (“Social media” in these cases always is Twitter, too. That is probably just because it is public facing, though it is also a popular place for broadcasting, calling out, and grandstanding.)</p>

<p>It will soon be the conventional wisdom that those who seek high offices—in public service or in private industry—should have no public social media presence, no blog—certainly no Twitter account—maybe no public online presence at all. That bothers me because I think there is value in publishing one’s thoughts to the world, in a blog, vlog, podcast, or whatever other medium I can&rsquo;t even conceive of yet. People have an urge to share and should not feel that they will be punished for it, especially years after they tap the “post” button.</p>

<p>I understand that some people are deliberately awful on social media, and that <em>is</em> a problem, but isn&rsquo;t it also a problem that “the Internet never forgets?” <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">The right to be forgotten</a> is at both ridiculous to ask for and essential for people to get along with each other after a certain point. How should we evaluate a person based on what she posted online? Does it matter how long ago a thought was posted? What is fair? I think we are at a cultural crossroads regarding these questions, and may be stuck at that crossroads for a long, long time.</p>

<p>I definitely don&rsquo;t have the hang of using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> yet, but I&rsquo;m learning. One thing that made me feel stupid is that I don’t know how to get rid of the &ldquo;Blog&rdquo; section that the template I&rsquo;m using wants to include. In the interest of getting something that is not bare HTML published, I created some meaningless blog posts.</p>

<p>The last time I used a static website publisher, I had to create my own themes from scratch. The hard part with that was in creating something that looked halfway decent on various screen sizes. With Hugo, there are a ton of great themes available, but they all have constraints about what content the site must contain. That is tough for me right now because I don&rsquo;t know how to change those settings, and I mostly want to create very simple sites.</p>

         	<p>Trust relies on three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Competence—can you do something well?</li>
<li>Benevolence—are you doing good?</li>
<li>Integrity—will you do the right thing, even when things are bad for you?</li>
</ol>

<p>I heard this breakdown on a podcast episode earlier this week, and loved the idea so much that I hastily dictated a note to Siri about it (I was in my car at the time), but I can’t recall which podcast I heard it on or who said it. I found an analogous summary of the idea on the Wiley Online Library site, in an abstract about a chapter of the book <em><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119206422.ch21">Handbook of Principles of Organizational Behavior: Indispensable Knowledge for Evidence‐Based Management, Second Edition</a></em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This chapter focuses on using the concepts of ability, benevolence, and integrity as a means of increasing trust. Ability, benevolence, and integrity are the most critical facets of trustworthiness. They foster a sense of trust in the leader by followers. Ability reflects the knowledge, skills, and aptitudes of a leader, in both technical areas and general management competencies. Benevolence and integrity are aspects of the leader&rsquo;s character, and require more time and attention on the part of followers before they can be reliably judged. In order to increase trust, leaders need to take steps to increase their ability, build their benevolence, and demonstrate their integrity. Leaders can do so on a follower‐by‐follower basis, but can also take steps to create a culture of trustworthiness within their organizations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Breaking down concepts like “trust”—which seem innately understood and obvious—into component parts can be very powerful. It gives you a way “in” when it comes to solving problems dependent on that concept.</p>

         	<p>I have been slowly teaching myself <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo</a> tonight. I haven&rsquo;t gotten to the fun part yet, I guess. Due to incompatibilities with themes and, in the case of my first install, with the location where I want to store my site files, I had to install Hugo (on my Linux server) four different times now: via snap, apt, the &ldquo;hugo” .deb package, and finally the “hugo extended&rdquo; .dev package. I am finally at the point where I may have found a theme that is suitable for my personal site landing page.</p>

<p>Hugo is not my first static site generator. I actually landed on a less-known one called <a href="http://laktek.github.io/punch/">Punch</a> a long time ago. It is not longer being developed, so I don&rsquo;t want to use it any more. It was very simple to use, though, in a way that Hugo does not seem to be. I think that once I get the hang of Hugo I will love it though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boston Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia, who hasn&rsquo;t played since 2019 because of a knee injury suffered two seasons earlier, announced his retirement Monday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could it have ended better and I finished my career the right way? Yeah of course,&rdquo; Pedroia said on a Zoom call with the media. &ldquo;But there was a reason I was the first one dressed at 5:30 for a 7 o&rsquo;clock game. I always tell my teammates that you never know if the game is going to start early. My biggest thing in my mind was that this could be my last game and you don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s the best way I approached it from Little League on. I had the best time playing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a Red Sox fan, Pedroia’s retirement is no surprise. He hasn’t been physically able to play for years, since he got injured by a Manny Machado slide at second base. It is sad nonetheless. In his prime, he was fun and exciting to watch, and embodied the quality I enjoy seeing the most as a fan: “the love of the game.”</p>

         	<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260269/anti-conservative-bias-social-media-no-evidence-nyu-research">Kim Lyons reports in <em>The Verge</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The contention that social media as an industry censors conservatives is now, as we speak, becoming part of an even broader disinformation campaign from the right, that conservatives are being silenced all across American society,” the report’s lead researcher Paul Barrett said in an interview with The Verge. “This is the obvious post-Trump theme, we’re seeing it on Fox News, hearing it from Trump lieutenants, and I think it will continue indefinitely. Rather than any of this going away with Trump leaving Washington, it’s only getting more intense.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one of those studies that <em>may</em> help future historians sort through the mess we are living through now. It is pretty obvious to me that there is a conservative bias on social media rather than a liberal one. The shocking election in 2016 of a mendacious “conservative” social media gasbag is enough proof. That he wasn’t deplatformed until he lost the 2020 election, despite sowing devision and inciting violence on social media platforms, is further proof of it.</p>

<p>I bristle now at hearing or seeing the word “conservative” describe the people running a disinformation campaign against their fellow citizens. There’s nothing “conservative” about this influential and dangerous wing of the Republican Party, which is undermining the basic traditions and institutions of society. I identify strongly as a political progressive, but I am also quite conservative in how I think that people should behave publicly and how ethically and transparently political institutions should be run.</p>

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2021/01/29/fullmetal-alchemist.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-01-29 16:02:08 -0400">Jan 29, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>While I have been working a ton lately, I can’t work every second of the day. I have been watching the “Fullmetal Alchemist” anime series (there are two), mostly late at night, to unwind.</p>

<p>I watched the entirety of “Fullmetal Alchemist”—which is the first anime adaptation of the manga—first. Because it veers widely off of the plot of the manga (which, since I am not a manga reader, I don’t care about), it seems to be widely considered the lesser of the two adaptations. I think that sells it short. There are lots of sad, thought-provoking episodes, especially toward the beginning of the run, in which characters and the audience question what it means to be human, and what is the value of a human soul. These questions build up to big ideas and set pieces by the end, which is satisfying. There are some structural problems with how the story is told—mostly in the way the timeline, pacing, and character balance shift between the beginning, middle, and end of the series—but there is no problem that majorly detracts from the series as a whole. You could quibble that a lot of the theory behind how the magic system works doesn’t make any sense, which is vital to the overall theme of the series. Consider, however, that it is a <em>magic system</em>, you have to suspend disbelief quite a bit to begin with, and of course it doesn’t make perfect sense.</p>

<p>I am almost done watching the second adaptation, “Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood”, which stays true to the manga plot and is generally lauded as the better of the two anime series. At this point, I don’t think of it as “better” but it certainly is much different. The stakes in “Brotherhood” are much higher, the characters are more tightly integrated throughout the series, and the tone overall is funnier and less sad, despite the raised stakes and some (somewhat) more mature relationship elements between childhood friends/teenage-phenoms Edward and Winry. Despite these advantages, “Brotherhood” is far more cartoony in style, which I don’t prefer. It uses <em>chibi</em> (super deformed) style far more heavily than the first adaptation did, which I find distracting—the characters are often blowing their stacks in anger or are extremely embarrassed or go into some of other extreme, but emotionally and visually, that takes me out of the story a bit. That is a relatively small demerit, however, and it is offset by the increased complexity of the story.</p>

<p>I am eager to see how “Brotherhood” ends, and would recommend that everyone try watching both series, especially the first one, because it is very good despite being the less-loved one.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>My wife and I recently discovered the Apple TV+ show “<a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/little-voice/umc.cmc.4x932osv992wjjdq7ce12za2r">Little Voice</a>” and very much enjoy it.</p>

<p>It is different in pace and tone from other shows (like “Curb Your Enthusiasm”) that we have been watching lately. While there is a lot going on in each episode, the pace feels slow and thoughtful, as if the show is focused mainly on the growth of its characters and on illustrating (a version of) the New York City music scene. I would not recommend watching “Little Voice” for its main plot, because it appears to follow the well-worn path of “talented-but-unknown artist slowly becomes successful.” That said, there are a ton of great character moments throughout.</p>

<p>The main draw of the show is the music, most of which are songs written by series co-creator Sara Bareilles. There is a lot of music performance in each episode. All these sections look great, sound great, and are integrated completely naturally into the story. However, they serve as the primary reason why the pace is slow. If you don’t like the music, then the show will not be for you.</p>

<p>Overall, I think that “Little Voice” is under-rated. It didn’t blow up like “Ted Lasso” (which is, indeed, great) or “Central Park” (which is also great), but is my third-favorite Apple TV+ series thus far.</p>

         	<p>I found this <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22231657/mkbhd-marques-brownlee-interview-youtube-creator-influencer-decoder">fairly long interview on <em>The Verge</em></a> with Marques Brownlee (<a href="https://youtube.com/c/mkbhd">MKBHD on YouTube</a>) to be very interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But what looks effortless and fun to the viewer is often the result of careful planning and investment. YouTubers are entrepreneurs, and Brownlee — my guest on today’s episode of Decoder — talks that talk with the best of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marques Brownlee could be described as “tech reviewer” or a “social media influencer” or a “YouTuber.” I don’t watch all his videos, but I have checked in with his YouTube channel periodically since I first saw him (as a college student!) on an episode of TWiT. While he is telegenic and charismatic, he also presents himself as someone with a strong sense of ethics who is very smart and thoughtful about he approaches his business. This interview gives a pretty long look into Marques Brownlee’s professional world.</p>

<p>My wife, who is a high school teacher, recently reported to me that one of the top “professions” that teens want to go into is “social media influencer.” That is kind of eyeroll-inducing to me, but I suppose it is as realistic and as meaningful an aspiration as “famous writer” was to me. It is important to know how much work goes into that sort of job, and how much time, investment, and infrastructure goes into keeping up with the competition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So what can you do about this right now? 1. Stop worrying about the variants until the experts let us know we have something to worry about. 2. If you are eligible for the vaccine, get it! 3. Spread the word about vaccine availability in your area. Yesterday Vermont opened signups for vaccination appointments for all Vermonters 75 and older, and I texted/emailed everyone I could think of who was over 75 or who had parents/relatives/friends who are over 75 to urge them to sign up or spread the word. 4. Continue to wear a mask (a better one if possible), wash your hands, social distance, stay home when possible, don’t spend time indoors w/ strangers, etc. Thanks to these remarkable vaccines, real relief is in sight — let’s keep on track and see this thing through.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My family is now obsessed with wearing two layers of masks, which I tried but couldn’t get to work with my glasses on. I am more interested in finally being able to buy and wear N95, KN95, and KN94 (my favorite) masks, which are more effective than the cloth masks and surgical masks I have been stuck with since February.</p>

<p>In New Jersey, vaccine distribution is both successful (my wife, who is a teacher, got her first dose yesterday) and a total mess (it is very hard to get an appointment, there is no central coordination of virus distribution, and any effective effort on prioritizing inoculations for higher-risk groups is effective gone). If my family is a good indicator of people’s behavior, then lots of us New Jerseyans keep hammering away at the appointment systems, trying to get a better appointment slot, which further jams up the system.</p>

         	<p>I spent about two hours last night trying to figure out if I can move my FreeNAS server, which constantly generates about 40 dB of fan noise white noise in my home office, to the basement, so that I can escape the noise. The problem I have is that there is nowhere else in my house where I can get a wired connection. I tried a wireless-to-ethernet bridging solution, and was super disappointed with how slow it was (40 mbps up/down).</p>

<p><em>Then</em> I thought about scrapping the FreeNAS server, because I don&rsquo;t need such a robust platform for my backups. I started looking into buying a Synology or something and loading it with larger hard drives so I don&rsquo;t lose capacity.</p>

<p>While I was doing that, I started moving files off my FreeNAS server to prepare for retiring it. Of course, in doing so, I fell in love with the dang thing all over again, because I released how many services I am running and how flexible and reliable it is. I would like to get rid of the fan noise, though, but if I do, I will then be bothered by the 25 dB of fan noise from my work laptop.</p>

<p>During the 2019 flu season from Sept. 29 to Dec. 28, the CDC reported more than 65,000 cases of influenza nationwide. During the same period last year, the agency reported 1,016 cases.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/barry-season-4-scripts-finished/">Per Ethan Anderton on <em>SlashFilm</em>, quoting Bill Hader:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Right when the lockdown happened in March, we were a week away from shooting. So the last time I was in a room with a lot of people was the table read episodes one and two of season three, and we were ready to go. Then it all got shut down. Season three is completely written, ready to go, and then during this time we actually went and wrote season four. So we have both of those kinda done. We’re just waiting until we can start shooting again.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Barry” is a <em> sui generis</em> example of peak TV. It takes a lot of risks in terms of both plot and tone, and so far they have all paid off. I certainly couldn’t predict how Bill Hader and Alex Berg were going to write their way out of the end of Season 2 of “Barry,” but I guess they cracked it and then some.</p>

         	<p>I was having a pretty good day yesterday, full of minor but meaningful personal and professional accomplishments, and then all hell broke loose in Washington, DC. I pushed the news of it away as best I could, so I am less informed than I otherwise would be, but I am sad, angry, and ashamed nonetheless.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-rioters-incite/2021/01/06/0acfc778-5035-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html">Per Philip Rucker in <em>The Washington Post</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The “American carnage” that Donald Trump vowed to end at the dawn of his presidency was revived in terrifying, treacherous form at its sunset Wednesday, as Trump made a fiery last stand and incited his supporters to storm and sack the U.S. Capitol as part of an attempted coup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t even know how to comment on this event without seeming glib, but I feel compelled to say something anyway.</p>

<p>I am, by trade, an auditor. One thing auditors are trained to investigate is called “tone at the top,” which represents the values expressed by the top management of a company which are expected from everyone who reports up to them.</p>

<p>After auditing for years, I have discovered that “tone at the top” is almost everything you need to know about an organization to get an idea how well and how ethically it is operated. Ethics and decency from the top of an organization really do trickle down all the way to the bottom and permeate it entirely. Moreover, they are strongly indicative of the organization’s *solvency*—its ability to hold together as a going concern over time.</p>

<p>When the “tone at the top” is selfish, vain, petty, petulant, aggrieved, unethical, amoral, and violent—as Trump’s has been—that tone trickles down to the whole organization, and pollutes the thoughts and corrupts the actions of the people within it. Unfortunately in this case, the “organization” is not just the Executive Branch, not just the federal government, and not just the Republican Party: it is the entire United States of America. What’s more, because the U.S. is a vastly influential country, the corruption and willful deceit at the head of it spills over into the rest of the world.</p>

<p>I feel like I have known this from the beginning—before the slow-moving coup even started—because I understood what the “tone at the top” was, and knew that it was vitally important. <em>Knowing</em> this, sadly, is not enough, because in a democracy a majority of people need to know this for things to turn out better. Being <em>able</em> to know this, like being able to discern the “tone at the top” as a new auditor, is a rare gift. It requires a trait that is not easily acquired, but is so difficult to teach and to learn that it is often considered to be innate: <em>shrewdness</em>.</p>

<p>That’s because “tone at the top” isn’t always as blatantly obvious as Trump’s vitriolic tweets and shambolic rally speeches. Understanding what the “tone at the top” <em>really</em> is, it requires a combination of healthy skepticism, decent powers of observation, and the knowledge of how things are supposed to work. You have to understand both context <em>and</em> subtext; subtext is much harder to grasp than context, but is often the more important to the two. You have to interpret people’s words <em>and</em> actions, and compare them to each other to see if the actions follow the words. You also have to have some kind of ethical foundation—which may be laws of the state, societal norms, or virtue ethics— on which to base your conclusions.</p>

<p>The human mind has evolved to do a lot of this analysis automatically. Consider that establishing whether you trust another person is, and always has been, an essential part of human interaction. But, like a lot of thought processes that are largely automatic, many times mental shortcuts are taken and the wrong choice is made. To be able to second-guess these automatic thought processes takes intellect, some degree of guidance, and a willingness to think a little harder.</p>

<p>I would not be surprised to learn that many of the people trying to unlawfully overturn the election—not counting the elected officials who are operating out of cynical self-interest—really do think they are making an ethical decision, and really do think they are doing the right thing. They just trusted the wrong person, or made the wrong decision about voting for or supporting, because they lack the shrewdness and imagination to discern that the “tone at the top” really does matter, and that bad words from a lazy president really will lead to riots in the streets.</p>

         	<p>I got a chance to play a few hours of <a href="https://www.orithegame.com"><em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em></a> over the past couple days, and think it is absolutely amazing. While it definitely rehashes some of the same scenarios and story beats from the first game, the <em>gameplay</em> is actually significantly more complex and rewarding. I think I&rsquo;m benefiting from my experience with the first game, which I played through twice, but I have found the sequel to be a little more forgiving in its difficulty.</p>

<p>In general, it is wonderful to have some fun video games to retreat to in this very stressful pandemic time. I do recognize that I need to turn away from gaming a little bit more than I have been, and move back to more productive activities in my &ldquo;free time.&rdquo; Games like <em>Ori</em> make that just a little bit harder.</p>

This year, I found some Christmas music I actually like (the &ldquo;Jazz Christmas&rdquo; playlist on Apple Music, plus &ldquo;Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas&rdquo; and Nat King Cole’s &ldquo;Christmas Music.”), and plan to bake cookies and host a family dinner this evening.

It is based on a three-book series, so three seasons of TV adaption makes perfect sense. I hope that more book-to-one-season-of-television adaptations are made going forward, because it offers more time to tell the story than a 2-hour movie, but not <em>too much</em> time, like an open-ended TV series adaptation would.</p>

<p>While it is not my <em>favorite</em> show on TV right now, it is up there. I think the cast is fantastic and the cinematography and visual effects look great. <em>The Amber Spyglass</em>, book three of the series, is my least favorite, and I have no idea how parts of it could be visualized the the screen, but I don&rsquo;t have any doubts that &ldquo;His Dark Materials&rdquo; will do a really good job with it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m OK with this. I loved Season 1 of &ldquo;Ted Lasso&rdquo; but I think the premise will completely wear out its welcome by episode 30. Limited series are good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Enola Holmes case hinged on Sherlock Holmes’ complicated copyright status. Most Holmes stories sit in the public domain, and stories like Enola Holmes — which reimagines Holmes (played by Henry Cavill) having a younger sister — can freely repurpose their elements. But 10 of Arthur Conan Doyle’s stories are still protected by copyright, and the Doyle estate argued that they depict a meaningfully different version of the character. (He’s more caring, less overtly contemptuous of women and friendship, and generally less of a jerk.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe Arthur Conan Doyle&rsquo;s estate should have <em>any</em> rights over Sherlock Holmes at all. Conan Doyle died in 1930. It&rsquo;s completely outrageous.</p>

<p>I can’t help but think that Disney may be planning to give fans <em>too much</em> of a good thing. The whole kerfuffle about <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3778644/">Solo</a> flopping, due to exhausted audience interest, which led to the scuttling of the <em>Star Wars</em> side story movie series, is only about two years old.

<blockquote>
<p>When earmarks were a regular feature of congressional business, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said Democrats and Republicans were able to cut more deals and pass more bills with bipartisan support.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds like a bad idea at first, but it probably is actually a good one. Congress can&rsquo;t pass meaningful legislation anymore, in part because there is almost no bipartisan agreement on important bills. Maybe allowing earmarks will make it easier to gain votes &ldquo;across the aisle&rdquo;—you know, like it used to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By moving into the premium headphones space, Apple will directly compete with brands like Bose, Sony, Sennheiser, AKG, Bowers and Wilkins, and others that have years of experience and a long list of products between them. Apple is going higher than just about all of them on price, but the company is riding the momentum of the AirPods and AirPods Pro, which have dominated the true wireless earbuds market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that Apple&rsquo;s headphones cost more than any in my collection—and I have some pretty impressive headphones.</p>

<p>The headband design looks a little odd at the top. I hope the engineers sacrificed looks for comfort there.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s a shame they charge via Lightning</p>

<p>We are squarely in the farce phase.

         	<p>Wajahat Ali, writing an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/opinion/trump-supporters.html">op-ed in the New York Times</a>, has given up on Trump supporters:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We cannot help people who refuse to help themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get it. It was shocking that Trump actually gained in the vote count after four years of doing everything he could to diminish American standing and influence in the world, and the rights and lives of people within his own borders. It is worse to have lived through an era in which the Republican Party went from a political movement with some bad ideas about taxation and social services to a full-on fascist personality cult.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to blame Trump. He <em>is</em> a problem. But he is not the only problem. Ali hits at this deep into the article (my emphasis added in bold), stating something that is vital to understanding the predicament we are in:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump is an extension of their id, their culture, their values, their greed. He is <strong>their</strong> defender and savior. He is <strong>their</strong> blunt instrument. He is <strong>their</strong> destructive drug of choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thing we should not forget about the Trump supporters is that _they empower him_—it&rsquo;s not the other way around. If Trump is a lightning rod, his supporters are the lightning.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t turn your back on those people because they are still here and are not going anywhere. Changing their minds might be a generation&rsquo;s worth of work, but it is work that has to be done because social institutions are breaking down, and not by accident. The Republican Party transformed itself over the past fifty years into what it is now, through planning, determination, and lots and lots of money. There is no reason that the Democratic Party can&rsquo;t do the same. It takes a lot of things, but most of all <em>will</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Epic Games and Spotify, united in their fight against Apple, each released statements on Wednesday slamming the iPhone maker following news of its new App Store fee reduction for developers making less than $1 million per year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>File this under &ldquo;some people are never happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While I don&rsquo;t <em>love</em> all of Apple&rsquo;s policies—for example, it is ridiculous that developers have to <em>opt in</em> to the small business program—I believe that, as the owner of their platform (which is not even the <em>majority</em> platform),  they do have the right to make and enforce whatever rules they choose.</p>

<p>I found this statistic (emphasis added) in the article very interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The cut should apply to an <strong>estimated 98 percent of iOS app developers that generated just 5 percent of the App Store’s revenue</strong> last year, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a long, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail">long tail</a>. It really makes me think about how insignificant most app developers are to Apple.</p>

         	<p>I very much enjoyed <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-rise-and-fall-of-getting-things-done">Cal Newport&rsquo;s rumination on Getting Things Done</a> (GTD), and Merlyn Mann&rsquo;s contributions to personal productivity culture, in The New Yorker.</p>

<p>Finding <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com">Getting Things Done</a>, through Merlyn Mann&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.43folders.com">43 Folders</a>, was transformative for me. It supercharged my productivity, for a while at least, numerous times in my life.</p>

<p>GTD techniques and processes have not fixed the root problems with knowledge work, which Newport points out in the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this context, the shortcomings of personal-productivity systems like G.T.D. become clear. They don’t directly address the fundamental problem: the insidiously haphazard way that work unfolds at the organizational level. They only help individuals cope with its effects. A highly optimized implementation of G.T.D. might have helped Mann organize the hundreds of tasks that arrived haphazardly in his in-box daily, but it could do nothing to reduce the quantity of these requests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have a workaholic culture that puts a lot of pressure on the individual worker to be responsible for many, many things that are outside the worker&rsquo;s control. GTD is both a means of dealing with this pressure, and a personal methodology that prolongs one&rsquo;s exposure to all this pressure. It increases the number of balls you can keep in the air, but doesn&rsquo;t address the problem that others keep throwing more and more balls at you that they expect you to juggle.</p>

         	<p>I was at first surprised that Trump gained voters across the board since 2016. But then I recalled that he went from <em>joke candidate</em> in 2016 to <em>the actual President of the United States</em> (who haunts our every waking thought and nightmare) in 2020. The incumbent always has many advantages, but legitimacy may be the most important one.</p>

         	<p>News outlets started calling the presidential race for Joe Biden this morning. In no sense should it have been a close call. It is deeply embarrassing. I consider the USA a failed state in the midst of a slow moving fascist coup that began with Nixon, found its footing with Reagan, and found its most effective bomb-thrower and wrecking ball (because he is the most shameless) in Trump. I am not sure reform is possible at this point, but if it is (and I hope it is), it will take a long, long time.</p>

         	<p>The always interesting Raspberry Pi Foundation has <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-400-the-70-desktop-pc/">announced a new &ldquo;desktop PC&rdquo; form factor that integrates its latest board into a keyboard</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We’ve never been shy about borrowing a good idea. Which brings us to Raspberry Pi 400: it’s a faster, cooler 4GB Raspberry Pi 4, integrated into a compact keyboard. Priced at just $70 for the computer on its own, or $100 for a ready-to-go kit, if you’re looking for an affordable PC for day-to-day use this is the Raspberry Pi for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the keyboard is decent enough for you, and your computing needs are pretty basic, this is fantastic deal.</p>

<p>My favorite part of the new design is that all the ports are on one side. My biggest beef with the Raspberry Pi (I own 3 of them!) is that the ports are on all four sides, and I always need to plug cables into two or three of them, which makes for a mess of wires surrounding a nice, small box.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The surprise Nintendo Direct at the end of October ended with another glimpse at Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity that shows off how the Breath of the Wild prequel will let you control the powerful Divine Beasts from the open-world Legend of Zelda game. It also noted that the hack-and-slash game has a playable demo that fans can download via the Nintendo Switch eShop now, and it includes the entirety of the first chapter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy about this development. I love &ldquo;Breath of the Wild&rdquo; and would love to experience more world-building related to it, but I have never played a &ldquo;Dynasty Warriors&rdquo;-type game and have no idea if I would like it.</p>

One thing I learned about him, from an alumni event (long ago) with his onetime producer, Jon Landau, is that Springsteen was not able to write dozens and dozens of songs and pick the best for his albums. He wrote relatively small numbers of good (and sometimes great) songs. That makes it all the more impressive to me that he has been releasing new material so regularly, and the quality is still high.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For partisans, politics is a morality play, a struggle of good versus evil. But most Americans just see two angry groups of people bickering over issues that may not always seem pressing or important.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is easy to think that &ldquo;most Americans&rdquo; are somehow wise to not follow politics closely enough to identify the issues of the day. In fact, these inattentive &ldquo;nonpartisans&rdquo; are being irresponsible citizens.</p>

<p>Articles like this make me wonder if the authors intend to bolster, rather than merely to point out, the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/bothsidesism">both sidesism</a>&rdquo; that leads people to disengage with civic life.</p>

<p>A team of researchers in the Netherlands has discovered what may be a set of previously unidentified organs: a pair of large salivary glands, lurking in the nook where the nasal cavity meets the throat. If the findings are confirmed, this hidden wellspring of spit could mark the first identification of its kind in about three centuries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maine Business Daily is part of a fast-growing network of nearly 1,300 websites that aim to fill a void left by vanishing local newspapers across the country. Yet the network, now in all 50 states, is built not on traditional journalism but on propaganda ordered up by dozens of conservative think tanks, political operatives, corporate executives and public-relations professionals, a Times investigation found.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This article serves as yet another example of the extent and level of organization of the American radical right&rsquo;s propaganda and disinformation machine. What I wonder, though, is why don&rsquo;t progressives take this playbook and run with it themselves to push the opposite agenda? It seems obvious and cost-effective.</p>

<p>Looks like election fraud is happening just as Trump/Pence want it to. As a NJ voter, my confidence in the election process has taken a hit, and it is not because liberal, illegal immigrants are voting multiple times for the Democrats. 🙄 I now plan to drive my mail-in ballot to wherever the drop box is for my town.</p>

         	<p>After reading <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/books/erno-rubik-rubiks-cube-inventor-cubed.html">this article about Erno Rubik</a>, inventor of the Rubik&rsquo;s Cube, I ordered myself a 3x3 speed cube (not a Rubick&rsquo;s brand cube).</p>

<p>I had a Rubik&rsquo;s Cube as a child, and never solved it. At one point, I remember having solved it except for two squares, and I peeled the stickers off and swapped them. (That was sort of my &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gord&hellip;</a>&rdquo; moment, I guess. 😂)</p>

<p>At this point, I don&rsquo;t care if I ever do solve it on my own (there are guides to solving it that I might decide to follow), but it will likely be fun to play with while I&rsquo;m on conference calls or watching TV. Hopefully it will be an object of fascination for my kids, too, and I will get them their own to play with.</p>

I beat the game (which is, basically, completing only about a third of the objectives) and have enjoyed, somewhat, the post-game experience. I have concluded, though, that I am terrible at Mario games. Lots of the platforming sections are frustrating for me, maybe because I didn&rsquo;t grow up with 3D gaming and can&rsquo;t get used to the perspective.  Perhaps the Zelda &ldquo;Hyrule Warriors&rdquo; sequel would be more my speed.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/8/19/21364031/coronavirus-air-purifiers-filter-hepa-merv-ventilation">Brian Resnick&rsquo;s article on Vox</a> summarizes some of the issues we are all facing in the back-to-school period. Coronavirus is in the air, and being indoors with an infected person for a prolonged time increases the viral load that one is exposed to. This is critical to understand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As Derek Thompson observes in the Atlantic, a lot of places have put on a big show about cleaning surfaces — what he calls “hygiene theater” — though surface contamination is not thought to be a large source of Covid-19 transmission.</p>

<p>Making places safer, instead, should mean improving air quality. But “have you ever heard a restaurant reopening announce they’ve improved ventilation or increased ventilation?” Lidia Morawska, an engineer and the director of the International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health at Queensland University of Technology, recently told me. “No.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The &ldquo;hygiene theater&rdquo; of surface cleaning is already entrenched in mask wearing. Mask wearing is critical to reducing disease transmission from a public health perspective, but masks aren&rsquo;t magical COVID-19 blockers, especially when people are wearing them around their chins or taking them off before they sneeze (seriously, I have seen this in the grocery store). I think that a lot of people believe lots of activities, like sitting in a classroom all day, are OK as long as everyone wears masks, at least most of the time. I don&rsquo;t believe that—at least not at a time in which Covid cases are climbing, and outbreaks have been traced to gatherings of people indoors or families sharing a home.</p>

<p>I am concerned that in schools, restaurants, and other public places, &ldquo;ventilation theater&rdquo; will soon run rampant. We will be promised that &ldquo;ventilation system improvements&rdquo; will protect us, our children, and our grandparents, even when most buildings can&rsquo;t be redesigned to  circulate or scrub the air with any real effectiveness. The article points this out, too:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember: Hygiene theater is possible when it comes to air quality as well. If a school or any indoor space says it has improved ventilation, ask how. Marr suggests asking building operators what the air exchange rate is (if they don’t know it, maybe be wary about the space). Ask about what filters have been put in place. Ask if their HVAC systems have been routinely maintained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do wonder when things will go back to pre-Covid normal. I am advocating opening windows and using window fans to exchange inside- and outside air, to the extent that is possible, in public buildings. Most places I can think of aren&rsquo;t really designed for that, unfortunately.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I noticed something strange on the latest iPadOS developer beta. The Fn key on my Apple Magic Keyboard (the old Bluetooth one, not the expensive new iPadPro peripheral) now has two new functions that kind of conflict with each other.</p>

<p>First, Fn-Backspace finally works as &ldquo;forward delete&rdquo; as it always has on the Mac. (That not being supported on iOS has long been a source of occasional frustration for me.)</p>

<p>Second, Fn, by itself, calls up the emoji picker, which used to be only called by Control-Command-Space.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, using Fn-Backspace calls up the emoji picker, which means I have to dismiss it (via Esc) if I want to forward delete. That does not save a keystroke, and makes &ldquo;forward delete&rdquo; not worth it.</p>

I signed up for <a href="https://nextdns.io">NextDNS</a> instead, and so far I&rsquo;m really happy with it. It blocks malware; it blocks adult content; it blocks ads. Unlike the pi-hole, it can be used away from my home network, too. I have set up different profiles for everyone in my family, and switched everyone&rsquo;s devices to use it today. The funny thing is, my wife hasn&rsquo;t noticed yet that ads are being blocked on her phone or computer. I think that&rsquo;s a good thing—it means that content filtering hasn&rsquo;t broken anything for her yet.</p>

It does not help that my laptop has a USB-C + charging port, and a Thunderbolt 3 report (that also charges, though that wasn&rsquo;t clear at first). I was not sure why I could not charge my laptop through the dock, until I noticed the distinction between USB-C and Thunderbolt, and I was not sure why my Thunderbolt-to-DisplayPort cable would not work from a USB-C port in the dock. Having the same ports/connectors does not make USB and Thunderbolt easier to deal with: it makes it harder.</p>

         	<p>I code in C# at work and in Swift in my home life. Each language has a default <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style">indentation style</a>, different mostly on whether opening curly braces (&ldquo;{&rdquo;) are placed at the end of a line or at the beginning of a line of their own. The former style is called the &ldquo;K&amp;R&rdquo; style, though I know it only as &ldquo;the one true brace style.&rdquo; The other style is called the &ldquo;Allman style,&rdquo; though I have never heard it called any name in particular, and think of it, myself, as &ldquo;C# style.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I leave my IDE code formatting defaults alone, so I have coded using the &ldquo;one true style&rdquo; in Xcode for Swift, and have coded using the C# style in Visual Studio. Both styles seem to work equally as well, but overall I prefer the way that the C# style helps ensure that all the opening and closing braces will line up.</p>

<p>I have been thinking this week to try to change my Swift coding style to match my C# coding style, but I can&rsquo;t bring myself to do it. I can&rsquo;t imagine using the C# style for Swift coding, or the &ldquo;one true style&rdquo; for C# coding; it just wouldn&rsquo;t look or feel right. I found out that a lot of this stylistic distinction is based, as so much is, on historical precedent: influential textbooks or famous programmers set the way, and the rest of us follow. Maybe I will break with convention on my next Swift project, but probably not.</p>

         	<p>The credit card companies have trained me very well to be really, really concerned about my credit score at all times. I check my credit score about once per week, even though it has always been in the “excellent” range and I have no real reason to check it. I have no reason to care about my credit score (I guess I am fortunate in that way) but I obsess about it nonetheless. It has been drilled into me that it is what responsible, ethical people do. I have internalized that logic as “it’s what <em>people like me</em> do.”</p>

<p>I think about China’s “<em>social</em> credit score” being implemented here in the United States somehow, what with the rise of authoritarianism and all, and marvel at how easy it would be to implement, and how much of it is already in place.</p>

<p>One of my favorite shows right now is Brooklyn Nine-Nine. It&rsquo;s characters, while being funny, eccentric, and often immature, are all portrayed as valorous and extremely dedicated to their jobs and to justice in general. That is part of its appeal to me. I don&rsquo;t see it as pro-cop propaganda, but it <em>does</em> work that way just a little bit, by presenting the world we wish was true, and allowing us to live in it for a while, as if it were true.</p>

         	<p>I wrote an AutoHotKey function today to paste decoded URL-encoded strings, which I have to do quite a lot because I&rsquo;m emailing people about files stored on SharePoint quite often now. It is useful to be able to paste a folder name or a file name without &ldquo;%20&rdquo; in the place of every space, and other URL-encoding garbage.</p>

<p>I like AutoHotKey well enough, but I wish it didn&rsquo;t have its own programming language. I&rsquo;d rather just use AutoHotKey to set hotkeys, and call out to  something else (C#, Python, Swift, JavaScript, even VB Script) for the functionality. I suppose that is <em>also</em> possible with AutoHotKey. Or, I could write my own Windows app to do that, somehow. But if I did that, I might have to implement my own programming language to support its scripting. 😅</p>

         	<p>The new iPhone SE looks like a great option for me if I break my current phone, which is a three-and-a-half-year-old iPhone 8 Plus. Mostly, though, thinks I can stay on my current phone for another year, or even more, if I can get another battery replacement.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://www.arqbackup.com/blog/arq-6-more-power-more-security-more-storage-savings/">Arq Backup 6 was just released</a>. It is really compelling software if you want to &ldquo;roll your own&rdquo; backup service, rather than use something tightly integrated with the back-end, like BackBlaze.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very glad, now, that I bought a lifetime license when Arq Backup 5 came out, four years ago. I got a free (as in, already paid for) upgrade!</p>

<p>Arq Backup 6 is much simpler looking than prior versions were. It is set up almost like a web app. Unfortunately, it no longer looks and feels much like a Mac app, which is one of the things that brought me to it in the first place. I don&rsquo;t use its main UI that much anyway, though, so that probably is not a big deal.</p>

To my surprise, a lot of the games just felt old and not nearly as engaging as I remember them—even stone-cold classics like &ldquo;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&rdquo; and &ldquo;Super Metroid&rdquo;. When I look for a 2D game fix, I always end up playing newer games, like &ldquo;Hollow Knight,&rdquo; rather than playing the older games that I did legitimately love when I was a kid. I wonder if my kids will ever want to play those classic games, or if they will just skip them all because they aren&rsquo;t worthwhile compared to more recent games.</p>

I&rsquo;m debating what to do about it. A huge part of my backup strategy is using Arq backup to back up my full-resolution photos (the entire library, really) to Backblaze B2. Maybe I will export all my photos (the originals) and copy them to B2, then turn on “Optimize Storage”, and then stop trying to back up my originals on my Mac. I&rsquo;m not getting a new Mac with a 1 TB SSD in it anytime soon, unfortunately. What a pain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Executive leadership changes happen at major companies all the time — but at Google, Naughton’s move is notable because she was a key figure responsible for dealing with an unprecedented level of internal employee turmoil and dissent. In recent years, Google workers feuded among themselves and with management over issues ranging from the company’s alleged mishandling of executive sexual harassment cases to its crackdown on employee speech in the workplace. Naughton is also the fourth long-tenured Google executive, including the company’s cofounders, to step down from an executive position or resign altogether in recent months.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Google&rsquo;s main internal problem, from my outside point-of-view, is that the things they are best at—software and services—are not really their business. They are just Google&rsquo;s bait. Their business is online advertising, and that business is at odds, in many respects, with quality software and user-focused services.</p>

         	<p>There is a lot of confusion surrounding election security, and how voting machines should work. Every tech pundit podcaster I listen to says that electronic voting machines must have a paper trail, so there is a backup if the software behind the voting system fails. That sounds reasonable.</p>

<p>The thing is, they all have it backward. The <em>original</em> vote should be on paper. The paper trail should be the actual votes cast, not the results recorded by voting machines. After all, if the software running the voting machines is improperly coded or compromised by malware, why would we trust the paper trail that same software creates?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are election experts that know far better than I do how to do it right. I just wish someone would call into question the assumption that a computerized machine is necessary to cast votes in the first place.</p>

At this point, I&rsquo;m considering it a failed product model. Hopefully the next iPad Pro, which I hope comes out later this year, will be much better. I&rsquo;m ready to upgrade, despite the cost.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/01/the_ipad_awkwardly_turns_10">John Gruber does <em>not</em> like the iPad multitasking interface</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The iPad at 10 is, to me, a grave disappointment. Not because it’s “bad”, because it’s not bad — it’s great even — but because great though it is in so many ways, overall it has fallen so far short of the grand potential it showed on day one. To reach that potential, Apple needs to recognize they have made profound conceptual mistakes in the iPad user interface, mistakes that need to be scrapped and replaced, not polished and refined. I worry that iPadOS 13 suggests the opposite — that Apple is steering the iPad full speed ahead down a blind alley.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gruber is far from the only person decrying the software on the iPad on the 10th anniversary of its reveal, but I think the strength of these opinions has more to do with punditry than with actual problems with the iPad&rsquo;s usability. I would imagine that most iPad users don&rsquo;t use multitasking, don&rsquo;t want to use it, and don&rsquo;t trigger it by accident. Moreover, <em>multitasking can be turned off</em> in the Settings App (look for the switch for &ldquo;Allow Multiple Apps&rdquo;).</p>

<p>I think the iPad multitasking interface is fine. What I would hate is if Apple put a freeform, windowed interface on it, to make it more like the Mac. That would introduce far more fiddliness than I have the patience to deal with on a tablet.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://collider.com/rise-of-skywalker-worst-reviewed-star-wars-movie">Per Matt Golderberg at Collider</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, the final Rotten Tomatoes tally has come in, and it looks like The Rise of Skywalker is the worst-reviewed Star Wars movie ever, sitting at 52%, one percent lower than Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually enjoyed <em>Rise of Skywalker</em>. <em>The Last Jedi</em> was the film that ruined the Star Wars franchise for me—it wasn&rsquo;t really bad, like <em>The Phantom Menace</em>, but it both added and threw out so much of the <em>Star Wars</em> cannon that it made the phone thing seem silly and unimportant.</p>

<p>Now that I have seen all all three &ldquo;sequel trilogy&rdquo; movies, the whole &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; franchise seems silly and unimportant. Creatively, the sequel trilogy was completely bankrupt, amounting mostly to remakes of the prior (good) films, and repeats and amplifications of prior plot points. I don&rsquo;t hate it now, though. I think of it as enjoyable cinematic fluff: entertaining diversions, like really high-budget B-movies. It just isn&rsquo;t <em>important</em> and it clearly doesn&rsquo;t make <em>any</em> sense. Accepting that, I can enjoy them when I want to escape to &ldquo;a time long ago, in a galaxy far away,&rdquo; and otherwise not think about them at all.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I was thinking of &ldquo;<a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt7520794/">Russian Doll</a>&rdquo; and put on <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/gotta-get-up/304815001?i=304815004">&ldquo;Gotta Get Up&rdquo; by Harry Nillson</a>. Curious about the song, I looked it up on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotta_Get_Up">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2019, &ldquo;Gotta Get Up&rdquo; was prominently featured as the &ldquo;reset&rdquo; song in the Netflix series Russian Doll. The song plays each time the series’ protagonist Nadia (co-creator Natasha Lyonne) dies and returns to the same location – a bathroom at her 36th birthday party. Its use is similar to that of Sonny &amp; Cher&rsquo;s &ldquo;I Got You Babe&rdquo; from the 1993 film Groundhog Day.  Lyonne explained that in choosing the song she was struck by the &ldquo;buoyant doomsday quality&rdquo; of Nilsson&rsquo;s life. The cost of using the song so many times took up a significant portion of the music budget. His estate also limited how many times the song could be used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reading this got me thinking about what nonsense music rights are for TV and movies. Why are song rights so expensive? Moreover, why should Nillson&rsquo;s estate be able to limit &ldquo;how many times the songs could be used? (Harry Nilsson died in 1994.) That sounds so frustrating to deal with. I don&rsquo;t understand why more TV producers don&rsquo;t just hire musicians to record cover versions and cut out, at the very least, the performance royalties. (I know this sometimes happens. I&rsquo;m surprised it doesn&rsquo;t happen more.)</p>

         	<p>🎵 Today&rsquo;s listen: <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/1989/1440829846">&ldquo;1989&rdquo; by Ryan Adams</a>. It&rsquo;s a melancholy, largely acoustic cover of Taylor Swift&rsquo;s massively more famous album of the same name. I think reinterpreting these songs was a great idea, but I prefer the big, studio sound of the original album.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://slate.com/culture/2020/01/oscar-nominations-2020-joker-best-picture-no.html">Dan Kois, on <em>Slate</em>, rips into &ldquo;Joker&rdquo;</a>, which today was nominated for a surprising 11 Oscars:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today—as Joker receives 11 Oscar nominations, the most of any movie, including Best Picture and Best Director—is the day that someone must stand astride the tracks and say: Enough. Stop the madness. Joker is not the best picture of the year. Joker is dumb as hell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The entire article is a fun-to-read tirade against the movie—it&rsquo;s the sort of contrarian opinion piece that <em>Slate</em> used to be renowned for.</p>

<p>Kois&rsquo;s flip-out reminds me of how I felt when the 2015 movie, &ldquo;Mad Max: Fury Road&rdquo; was nominated for Best Picture. That movie, and the world it depicts, doesn&rsquo;t make a lick of sense, but people still gush over it.</p>

<p>At this point in my life, I think the Oscars themselves are &ldquo;dumb as hell&rdquo; and are best ignored.</p>

         	<p>This album is probably known as one of R.E.M.&rsquo;s lesser efforts. When it came out in 2001, I didn&rsquo;t like it. Compared to R.E.M.&rsquo;s earlier work, it felt pat and drowsy. The mid-tempo arrangements lacked insistence and energy, and all the studio sound effects felt unnatural and unmusical to me at the time. I played it once and didn&rsquo;t listen to it any more.</p>

<p>A few years later, one of my friends said, offhandedly, after &ldquo;All the Way to Reno (Our&rsquo;s Gonna be a Star)&rdquo; came on the radio, that he absolutely loved the album. I got to hear it through new ears, and came to love how good it <em>sounds</em>, and to think of the songs as dark, late night, chill-out rock, whose arrangements and instrumentation move between spareness to lushness in interesting ways.</p>

         	<p>🎵 Today&rsquo;s album: <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/diatom-ribbons/1474418624">&ldquo;Diatom Ribbons&rdquo; by Kris Davis</a></p>

<p>Kris Davis is a jazz pianist, composer, and bandleader. The New York Times crowned &ldquo;<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/diatom-ribbons/1474418624">Diatom Ribbons</a>&rdquo; as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/arts/music/best-jazz.html">#1 jazz album of 2019</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kris Davis, 39, has spent years as her generation’s powerhouse pianist in waiting. No longer. On “Diatom Ribbons,” her skills as a composer, band assembler, system builder and improviser — a musical auteur, basically — come fully into focus. Ms. Davis builds her compositions on crooked patterns and splintered loops that somehow become a kind of magnetic touchstone, bringing together wildly diverse musicians in tangled unity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t listen to jazz that much anymore but I used to listen to it for hours on end as I read and wrote my way through my senior year of college. (It helped that I could get countless jazz CDs for free at the library.) &ldquo;Diatom Ribbons&rdquo; is more edgy and experimental than the classic jazz I grew up on, but I found it quite enjoyable. Listening to it is like visiting a musical world I kind of understand, and kind of don&rsquo;t, but feeling warm and welcome all the same.</p>

<p>Antonoff is an overwhelming, chameleonic presence and an easy pick as New Jersey’s most dynamic and prolific artist of the 2010s — no local musician has created so much or touched so many corners of the industry.

         	<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/01/the-miseducation-of-the-american-boy/603046/">Peggy Orenstein&rsquo;s article in <em>The Atlantic</em></a> exploring the sorry state of musculinity, as experienced by the American teenager, is well written and worth reading:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Feminism may have provided girls with a powerful alternative to conventional femininity, and a language with which to express the myriad problems-that-have-no-name, but there have been no credible equivalents for boys. Quite the contrary: The definition of masculinity seems to be in some respects contracting. When asked what traits society values most in boys, only 2 percent of male respondents in the PerryUndem survey said honesty and morality, and only 8 percent said leadership skills—traits that are, of course, admirable in anyone but have traditionally been considered masculine. When I asked my subjects, as I always did, what they liked about being a boy, most of them drew a blank. “Huh,” mused Josh, a college sophomore at Washington State. (All the teenagers I spoke with are identified by pseudonyms.) “That’s interesting. I never really thought about that. You hear a lot more about what is wrong with guys.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to make masculinity less toxic, we (men especially) have to define it in positive, attainable attributes. To be masculine <em>should</em> mean (1) to have self-discipline, (2) to take responsibility for your actions (even when you are wrong), and, most importantly, (3) to care for people (friends, family, community, and those who are vulnerable) with your words and actions. Masculinity should be about using your strength-both physical strength and, more importantly, inner strength-to preserve and protect people, society, and nature, as best you can. I don&rsquo;t think this is a new definition of masculinity, though. I think it is a very, very old one—one whose traits do not stand in contrast with femininity, but, instead, they overlap and support femininity—and feminism too.</p>

         	<p>It looks like <a href="https://www.freenas.org">FreeNAS</a> is, eventually, going to run on top of Debian Linux, not just FreeBSD. VP of Engineering Kris Moore <a href="https://www.ixsystems.com/community/threads/freenas-plans-2020-and-beyond.80462/">posted</a> today:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] we’re going to be hard at work in 2020 to make our 12.0 code portable across multiple OS platforms. The middleware at the core of FreeNAS is already pretty portable today, and we want to start extending its reach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty cool. Good on them to unbolt their software from the underlying OS. I think it will give them a lot more flexibility going forward. I don&rsquo;t know if I will <em>run</em> FreeNAS on Linux anytime soon, though. I learned to adore BSD&rsquo;s stability and simplicity from running FreeNAS, but it has made it harder to virtualize and/or run some useful services on my hardware.</p>

<p>Kris Moore went on to clarify:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FreeNAS as it exists will continue on FreeBSD for 12.0 and beyond. This will be bringing some of the same software-base to Linux to unveil some new products that are Linux-based in the coming months. If you currently are happy with FreeNAS as it sits today, you can expect to keep updating it on BSD going forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of this sounds good to me. FreeNAS has been a great platform for me for many years now.</p>

         	<p>Social media is a scam. Who knew?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/06/technology/fake-social-media-manipulation.html">Davey Alba reports in the New York Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;The] report also brings renewed attention to an often overlooked vulnerability for internet platforms: companies that sell clicks, likes and comments on social media networks. Many of the companies are in Russia, according to the researchers. Because the social networks’ software ranks posts in part by the amount of engagement they generate, the paid activity can lead to more prominent positions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No kidding that engagement is fake. Paying for fake &ldquo;Likes&rdquo; is the same kind of thing as paying for fake clicks, which is a scam performed to goose online ad revenue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, a department at Oxford University, said easy social media manipulation could have implications for European elections this year and the 2020 presidential election in the United States.</p>

<p>“Fake engagement — whether generated by automated or real accounts — can skew the perceived popularity of a candidate or issue,” Ms. Bradshaw said. “If these strategies are used to amplify disinformation, conspiracy and intolerance, social media could exacerbate the polarization and distrust that exist within society.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, paying to amplify a message will, indeed, amplify it, even if that message is false or destructive to the fabric of society. It&rsquo;s too bad that social media is so addictive. It is cause <em>so many</em> problems.</p>

         	<p>Today I learned that the Beatles&rsquo; &ldquo;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&rdquo; is widely reviled. From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ob-La-Di,_Ob-La-Da">Wikipedia article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&rdquo; is often the subject of ridicule. In 2004, it was included in Blender magazine&rsquo;s list titled &ldquo;50 Worst Songs Ever!&rdquo;[61] and was voted the worst song of all time in an online poll organised by Mars.[62] In 2012, the NME&rsquo;s website editor, Luke Lewis, argued that the Beatles had recorded &ldquo;a surprising amount of ropy old toss&rdquo;, and singled out &ldquo;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&rdquo; as &ldquo;the least convincing cod-reggae skanking this side of the QI theme tune&rdquo;. That same year, Tom Rowley of The Daily Telegraph said the track was a &ldquo;reasonable choice&rdquo; for derision, following the result of the Mars poll, and it subsequently came second (behind &ldquo;Revolution 9&rdquo;) in the Telegraph&rsquo;s poll to determine the worst Beatles song.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I always liked that song, and never thought of it as anything other than a light, fun song that is supposed to be—big shock here—light and fun. I&rsquo;m more apt to be critical of art that takes itself too seriously.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have been eyeing the <a href="https://jdslabs.com/product/element-ii/">JDS Labs Element II</a> desktop DAC/amp for about a week now. It looks great (I <em>want</em> the huge volume knob), it has all the power I would ever need, and it has gotten some great reviews regarding its sound quality and the excellence of its amp. I have almost bought it twice, and have almost bought its cheaper, older sibling, the famous <a href="https://jdslabs.com/product/objective2-odac-rev-b/">Objective2+ODAC</a> once from JDS and once from its other US manufacturer, <a href="https://mayflowerelectronics.com/o2-odac-overview/">Mayflower Electronics</a>.</p>

<p>The main thing holding me back is that I already have a pretty great DAC/amp, the (discontinued) <a href="https://www.oppodigital.com/headphone-amplifier-ha-2SE/">Oppo HA-2se</a>. I want to upgrade to a desktop model mainly to have more sturdy piece of equipment at my (admittedly already crowded) desk. I have had problems with my Oppo sliding off my desk. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind higher quality DAC and amp, though I probably wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell if it is any &ldquo;better&rdquo; than what I already have. Lastly, I think I just love audio gear. I would love to test a bunch of it and have a few pieces I really like around the house so I can use them all the time.</p>

<p>I have to stay strong, though, and avoid spending more money on my audiophile hobby, because I think my current equipment is already delivering me as much quality as my somewhat damaged ears can discern.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2019/12/02/green-by-rem.html">🎵 Green, by R.E.M.</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2019/12/02/green-by-rem.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-12-02 23:23:05 -0400">Dec 2, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I spent most of my workday listening to music today, and really enjoyed it. One album I revisited, thanks to a remaster and, basically, nostalgia, was <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/green-remastered/1440947724">&ldquo;Green&rdquo;</a> by R.E.M. Green was my first R.E.M. album, which I got when I was in middle school. (I don&rsquo;t remember how I learned about them. I know it wasn&rsquo;t from hearing &ldquo;Stand&rdquo;. It was probably from browsing &ldquo;Rolling Stone&rdquo; in a bookstore.)</p>

<p>Now, instead of reading liner notes while I listen to an album, I surf the web for album reviews to read instead. <a href="http://drownedinsound.com/releases/17638/reviews/4146397">The best &ldquo;Green&rdquo; review I found today</a> was by Andrezj Lukowski on Drowned in Sound:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Green is the end of something and the beginning of something else and the continuation of something greater, but rather than get lost in grand narratives, maybe let’s focus on what it sounds like.</p>

<p>For the most part, Green sounds like innocence, a sense of youth and light and simplicity and clumsiness and play that had not been in the band&rsquo;s makeup when they burst out of the Georgian murk with the Chronic Town and Murmur.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really know what the changes the remaster did to the album. It may have just made everything louder. Whatever the improvements were, the album sounded great on my super nice headphones. Of course, when I was a kid, listening to &ldquo;Green&rdquo; on repeat in my bedroom, I had real, but very cheap, speakers, so the experience isn&rsquo;t exactly comparable.</p>

<p>On other R.E.M. album remasters, I have found that I can understand every one of Michael Stipe&rsquo;s elliptical, nonsense lyrics on R.E.M.&rsquo;s oldest songs, and that isn&rsquo;t always a good thing. By the time R.E.M. made &ldquo;Green&rdquo;, Michael Stipe&rsquo;s lyrics were a lot more straightforward, and his singing was clear and up front in the mix.</p>

<p>Anyway, &ldquo;Green&rdquo; was and is still great. It was fun to revisit it today.</p>

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2019/11/26/linmanuel-miranda-isnt.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-11-26 10:23:12 -0400">Nov 26, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Lin-Manuel Miranda is both (1) the primary reason I got interested in the &ldquo;His Dark Materials&rdquo; TV series, and (2) didn&rsquo;t seem right to play the &ldquo;grizzled Texas cowboy&rdquo; character, Lee Scoresby. I barely remember the movie version of &ldquo;The Golden Compass&rdquo;, but what I <em>do</em> remember is Sam Elliott playing that role.</p>

<p>Myles McNutt, writing for the A.V. Club, <a href="https://tv.avclub.com/lin-manuel-miranda-isnt-the-lee-scoresby-we-remember-fr-1840037123">argues that that is intentional, and has a pretty good take on Miranda&rsquo;s part</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lin-Manuel Miranda is not really playing that Lee Scoresby. Yes, he’s an aeronaut, ostensibly from Texas. Yes, he’s got a history with an armored bear. And yes, he is swiftly caught up in Lyra Belacqua’s journey north with the Gyptians to free the children taken by the Gobblers. But his personality and his role within the tonal framework of this story are nothing like the character in the books, which is likely not a byproduct of Miranda’s casting but rather the reason behind it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;His Dark Materials&rdquo; is, mostly, a straight-ahead adaptation of &ldquo;Northern Lights,&rdquo; so the different take on the Lee Scoresby character surprised me. It took me a few minutes to warm up to his performance and take on the character, but, by the middle of the episode, I enjoyed it and was on board with wherever it would lead the series next.</p>

         	<p>I did a little audio geekery this evening. I set up <a href="https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync">shairport-sync</a> on the little Ubuntu server that sits toward the back of my desk, so that I can AirPlay to it from all my iOS devices. AirPlay is great because it transmits audio over WiFi with no quality degredation, and AirPlay devices are always listed in iOS, unlike BlueTooth speakers, which have to be connected to. Next, I configured PulseAudio to automatically switch to my headphone DAC/Amp when I turn it on. (My DAC/amp is a portable one with an internal battery, so I can&rsquo;t leave it plugged in all the time.) So far, so good with the new setup! By far the hardest part of the setup was searching online for the correct instructions to type into the terminal. I was happy to learn that shairport-sync is now in Ubuntu&rsquo;s repositories, but I think that things like this need to be easier to discover, and possible to install, in the GUI.</p>

         	<p>My daughter is a little like the kids in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/movies/frozen-let-it-go-families.html">this light article</a> by Kevin Noble Maillard:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What’s the most accurate way to describe kids’ relationship to “Frozen”? Adoration is insufficient, and obsession is downright weak. It’s more like a cathexis, an acutely intense energy focused on a singular entity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My daughter was borderline obsessed with Frozen for about five years. It lulled a bit for a while, but the existence of &ldquo;Frozen II&rdquo; on the horizon has revived her enthusiasm, especially with Elsa, quite a bit this year. After months of looking forward to it, my wife and I are taking her to see the sequel this weekend.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>So far, I have found Apple Arcade to be overwhelming, in terms of number of games available, and underwhelming, in terms of whether I want to spend more time playing games. One gem I found was &ldquo;Shantae and the Seven Sirens&rdquo; (a colorful Metroidvania-style game). I wanted to like the Oceanhorn sequel better than I did, but it just didn&rsquo;t grab me. There are lots of irreverent, mobile-style games, too, which I tried, but can&rsquo;t really justify putting more time into.</p>

<p>I think that I mainly don&rsquo;t have time to play video games right now, and don&rsquo;t want another monthly subscription to worry about (even though it is a low dollar one) either. My plan is to cancel my free trial just before it rolls over into a paid subscription. Perhaps I will try it again later.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The factories that make the drivers don’t care who they sell to; they maintain a certain level of quality because their clients depend on that. And once you’ve sourced the parts, it’s not expensive at all to put them together. “If you have a van and a bottle of glue,” Klasco says, “you can be in the business.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am a happy customer of one of the oldest Chi-Fi brands, HifiMan, which makes planar magnetic headphones at super low prices. Well, their prices are low for what types of products they sell, but in real dollar terms, they are pretty high: HifiMan mostly sell multi-hundred-dollar headphones, not $25 AirPods rip-offs.</p>

<p>I avoid most other Chi-Fi brands, because I would be concerned that build quality, and therefore produce longevity, would be very low. That said, I have paid lots of money for headphones from well-known, well-regarded, non-Chinese brands, and had them break in under two years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Having a teal pumpkin on the doorstep (teal being the color of food allergy awareness) is a way to signal to people with food allergies that this is a safe home for trick-or-treating, says Jennifer Norris, president of the Food Allergy Community of East Tennessee (FACET), which started the project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I learned about the teal pumpkins a couple years ago, and we have been a teal pumpkin house on Halloween ever since.</p>

<p>Since discovering that my children have peanut allergies, Halloween has moved from a fun tradition to an endless, irritating minefield of peanut-containing, and potentially peanut-contaminated, foods. (Practically every candy or baked good with chocolate may be contaminated with peanuts. As parents, my wife and I have to be very strict and diligent.) So much candy is off limits to my kids that it makes me feel sad for them. I think they do miss out on a huge, terribly unheathy part of the experience: the candy. We are baking some brownies and have purchased some truly safe, peanut-free chocolate for them, so Halloween will still be fun, even if the collecting candy part of trick-or-treating is kind of pointless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, said on Wednesday that the social media service would ban political ads on its platform, in a stark contrast to rival Facebook, which has faced blowback for taking a hands-off approach to political advertising.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is definitely the correct position to take, based on what we already know about the scale and effectiveness of social media disinformation campaigns, which are largely driven through social media advertising. Facebook, in contrast to Twitter, seems to be doubling down on their willingness for &ldquo;anything goes&rdquo; political advertising on its platform.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, the highly competitive Pay TV industry, with expensive content and network deals, has been slower to change than we expected,” said John Kodera, deputy president of Sony Interactive Entertainment, in a statement on the PlayStation Blog. “Because of this, we have decided to remain focused on our core gaming business.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s too bad, but not at all surprising.</p>

<p>I never understood why someone would want to watch TV on their PlayStation. For me, at least, gaming and TV don’t mix at all. I feel a huge mode switch between interactive and non-interactive entertainment. It wouldn&rsquo;t occur to me to want to do anything other than game on a gaming console.</p>

<p>Also, to me at least, Sony is not a brand I strongly identify with and want to align with additional areas of my life. I <em>do</em> like my Sony headphones, and <em>did</em> have a Playstation Portable long ago, but Sony has never been, in my opinion, a warm and appealing brand.</p>

The list goes on, and gets harder to swallow, until you start to wonder who really needs to go to Peter Luger, and start to think the answer is nobody.</p>

         	<p>John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/10/mails_message_action_toolbar_in_ios_13">took note of the terrible UI decisions Apple made on its iOS Mail app</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The new toolbar in iOS 13 Mail is just strange. The old toolbar had discrete buttons for Flag, Move, Trash/Archive, Reply, and New Message. Now it’s just Trash and Reply, with all of the other functionality stashed in the new Reply action sheet, pictured here half-height and full-height. That new “Reply” action sheet is really a “Do Something With This Message” sheet — I’m not sure what the icon for this should be, but the Reply icon seems like an odd choice. I know a few people who assumed that iOS 13 removed the ability to move messages to other mailboxes because the folder button was removed from the toolbar. They — reasonably! — never thought to look for it by tapping what clearly looks like the old familiar Reply icon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wanted to write about this for the past couple weeks, but decided not to complain to my blog about software that I could probably replace, if it really bothered me enough. I thought that Mail was perfect on iOS 12 and now it is much, much worse for me. The functionality I use most often—delete, archive, flag—is now two or three taps (or taps and swipes) away, when it used to be all in one tap at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beats is today introducing the Solo Pro, a $299.95 set of wireless headphones that add noise cancellation to the on-ear form factor shared by the company’s long line of previous Solo headphones. These are, for all intents and purposes, the Solo 4 Wireless, but they’ve been rebranded to match the Powerbeats Pro (and iPhone 11 Pro and every other tech product that now has “pro” tacked on to its name). The new headphones, Beats’ first on-ears with active noise cancellation, will ship on October 30th.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder if these are the rumored Apple over-the-ear headphones. I will hold out hope that they are not, and that some crazy high-end audiophile headphones are still in our future.</p>

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2019/10/07/apple-releases-macos.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-10-07 14:36:23 -0400">Oct 7, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>My Catalina upgrade was a headache. Here is a bullet list of my woes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The install process stalled for about an hour on &ldquo;Setting up your Mac&rdquo;. I eventually gave up waiting and forced my Mac to shut down. Luckily, after a reboot, the installation continued and completed in mere seconds.</li>
<li>System Preferences alerted me that there was a problem with my iCloud account sign-in. Entering my credentials again (several times) did not resolve the warning. I ignored it, at first, until I discovered the following two items.</li>
<li>All my iCloud drive files in the Documents and Desktop folders were missing.</li>
<li>My iTunes library was not displayed in the new Music app. I eventually found a preference that had to be enabled that brought them back, after a slight delay.</li>
<li>To fix the iCloud account and iCloud Drive problems, I signed out of iCloud Drive. During the sign-out process, I let it back up all my files to a local folder, which took a long time. After the backup finished, I signed back into iCloud, and iCloud Drive re-downloaded all my files. It took a while for my files to re-appear; the wait was stressful, even though I have backups.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was another one of those years in which a macOS upgrade made me wish I was an iOS (and now iPadOS) user only. That said, my computer did not get bricked, which happened with an automated Windows 10 update on one of my other machines a little while ago.</p>

         	<p>Apple Maps is significantly better in my part of the world (New Jersey) than it was a couple days ago. Justin O&rsquo;Beirne documented many of these improvements <a href="https://www.justinobeirne.com/new-apple-maps-northeast">in an epic article, full of graphics that illustrate the types of improvements that were made</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On September 30, 2019, Apple’s new map expanded to the Northeast U.S.
This is the fifth time that Apple has expanded its new map since its public launch in September 2018.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The before-and-after screenshots in his blog post tell a dramatic story about filling in all sorts of mapping data gaps. I am seeing the same kinds of dramatic changes illustrated in this article in the maps of my hometown in the metro-Hartford area and of my current town, in the metro-New York City area.</p>

<p>I hope that Apple was also able to improve its routing algorithms for driving directions. I have been disappointed with both Apple Maps and Google Maps on numerous trips to, and around, New York City in the past year. <em>Both</em> were bad at recommending a sensible route, and in similar ways.</p>

<p>Years ago, in an effort to answer a perennial question — what’s the best way to boil an egg? — I hatched a plan using the only method I know: lots and lots of testing.</p>

<p>Kenji&rsquo;s egg boiling method, which is egg <em>steaming</em> actually, is probably better than my own, which I picked up from <a href="https://twitter.com/altonbrown/status/188731859809734657">Alton Brown</a>. The way I do it makes perfect whites and yolks, but the eggs are nearly impossible to peel. Apparently, steaming eggs makes them easier to peel. I have got to try it!</p>

         	<p>🕹 I wonder why no one is saying much about &ldquo;Oceanhorn 2&rdquo; in regards to Apple Arcade. I don&rsquo;t have early access to Apple Arcade, so i can&rsquo;t find out myself, but that is the game I was most looking forward to out of all of them.</p>

         	<p>Matt Birchler posted <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/watchos-6-the-birchtree-review/">his review of watchOS 6</a> today:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>watchOS 6 is not a massive update to the platform, and you will likely use your watch in largely the same way you always have, but there are some new apps, nice usability updates, no real regressions, and frameworks that will allow third party apps to get better in the future. Basically, it won’t all change your life, but there is probably at least one or two things that you’ll really enjoy in this new update.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not exactly <em>eager</em> to upgrade my Apple Watch immediately, because it works just fine and I am happy with its behavior and performance, but I am looking forward to the new watch faces, which I think look nice.</p>

<p>I have had an Apple Watch since the original Series 0, but I have always been a little disappointed in the watch faces. I find it harder to read the time on the analog faces, based on simple things like the relative shortness of the hour hand, and, on many faces, the lack of numbers or larger hour markers on the dial. Also, I have long wanted a watch face with seven small complications and the time in the upper right corner, which would act as an app launcher for all the apps I use on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s new watch faces will provide some more visual variety, especially the California face, which will have various configuration options regarding the numbers on the dial. I do wish that Apple would allow you to change the shape and size of the watch hands, though. They are the same on every analog-style watch face.</p>

         	<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>I have been working on a PowerShell and SQL-heavy project at work for about a week now. To facilitate PowerShell development, I installed and configured Visual Studio Code, which is Microsoft&rsquo;s Electron-based code editor. I was not a fan of Visual Studio Code (hereafter called, simply, Code), due mainly to its lumbering speed when compared to Sublime Text, and somewhat, too, due to its brutalist design aesthetic. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>I must say, after using it for PowerShell development and debugging, that Code has grown on my quite a lot. I can develop, run, and debug PowerShell scripts in an IDE environment, edit Markdown files, and can even run SQL commands against my SQL Server Express instance (though query running is really slow compared to SQL Server Management Studio). There are many, many powerful extensions—way more than I would have expected. Some of them let me do other useful things, like convert delimited files to Excel right in the editor, that just aren&rsquo;t possible in Sublime Text.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>There are some drawbacks, though. RAM use is extremely high—nearly a gig even when there is only one file open—and runs, for me, about ten times as much RAM as Sublime Text uses. Also, it is really slow compared to Sublime Text. Loading even small files takes a few seconds, and I have to wait for syntax highlighting to be applied to the files after they are displayed in the editor for the first time. Still, I am liking it, and am using it, more and more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The big new feature this year is an always-on display option so you can see the time without having to move your wrist, something that has been asked for since the Apple Watch first debuted in 2015.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple is going to sell boatloads of Series 5 watches to upgraders, due to the new, always-on display. That is the one feature—and pretty much the only feature—I wish my Apple Watch 4 had.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple is also permanently dropping the price of the Series 3 to $199, matching the lowest sale price on that model we’ve seen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple will also sell boatloads of Series 3 watches at the new, lower price, too. Apple is wisely going down-market with their older watch models, just like they do with the older iPhone models.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/30/apple-tile-like-tag-item-tracker-what-to-expect/">Per Joe Rossignol and Steve Moser in MacRumors</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple is developing a Tile-like accessory that will help users keep track of their personal belongings, such as their keys, wallets, and backpacks, according to an internal build of iOS 13 seen by MacRumors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am a Tile user, and have been for years. I tried and gave up on Tile&rsquo;s main competitor, Trackr, because Tile worked better, despite its higher cost. I use a Tile once every few weeks or so to find my keys, but in the past I have used them to track our cars and luggage, too. A Tile fails to work when is when it is out of range of a Tile user&rsquo;s mobile phone, which is pretty much all the time in the suburbs where I live.</p>

<p>Though it ultimately depends on price, I expect I would switch from Tile to an Apple Tile-like device, if Apple ever actually releases one. My main reasoning is that they would probably be far more popular than the Tile or the Trackr, which means that there will be more people will be tied into their network. Apple will have to allow people to opt into being part of the &ldquo;Find My Item&rdquo; network, I suppose, but I still think many would do so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AAA recommends putting red light cameras in areas that have a pattern of crashes, with local law enforcement officials directly supervising the cameras.
&ldquo;Camera enforcement is a proven way to reduce red-light running and save lives,&rdquo; said Jessica Cicchino of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.</p>

<p>I guess so, but I bet the squad car &ldquo;enforcing&rdquo; the red light camera is the actual effective agent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still, some party officials lamented a system that limited exposure for lesser-known candidates. The Nebraska Democratic Party chairwoman, Jane Kleeb, a leading figure among rural Democrats, said a debate process that excluded Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana was bad for a party trying to win back voters who flocked to President Trump in 2016.
“Voters aren’t even going to know who Steve Bullock is and that we have a governor representing a red state and doing it with strong progressive values,” Ms. Kleeb said. “To me it shows the strength of our party that we have so many people running.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know Ms. Kleeb is merely supporting her candidate, but why is he even running if he has no national presence?</p>

<p>Honestly, if hardly anybody knows who you are, why do you think you can win an election for President of the United States? 🤷‍♂️</p>

<p><p>I am a big fan of <a href="https://medium.com/@kevinrose/introducing-zero-a-new-app-to-help-you-fast-209935e8245d">the Zero app</a>, which is a tracker for intermittent fasting. It is free, attractive, and has just enough features to keep me engaged and motivated, and no more. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>Currently, my favorite feature is its Apple Watch complication, which fills up a ring (similar to the Activity app’s rings) as you progress through your fasting period. I find that filling that ring every day, and the app&rsquo;s cheerful notifications every morning, really help motivate me to stop snacking or having an extra meal at night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>The only thing I don&rsquo;t like about it is that it requires you to set up an account with an email address. While the company behind it does not appear to be abusing my privacy in any way, I would prefer that they didn’t require an account. Perhaps they will adopt Sign in with Apple when it becomes available this fall.</p>

         	<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>I read <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/us/ransomware-attacks-hacking.html">this article in the New York Times</a> with interest, because I am an information security auditor by trade, and we have been educating companies and regulators about the dangers of Ransomware for what seems like forever, but has probably only been four of five years now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>The part of the article I found most interesting, because I have worked in and for the insurance industry for the past twenty years, relates to cyberinsurance:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:quote -->

<p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Fearing the worst, cities like Lake City, Fla., have bought cyberinsurance, and an insurer paid most of its ransom this summer. But some experts think that is only worsening the problem. “We see some evidence that there is specific targeting of organizations that have insurance,” said Kimberly Goody, a manager of financial crimes analysis for FireEye, a major cybersecurity firm, which says it has responded to twice as many ransomware attacks this year compared with 2018.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>I have two main observations about this section:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>First, it is galling that the typical fix for ransomware attacks is to pay the ransom, and rely on the good faith of the bad actor who locked away all the data to actually restore the encrypted data. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>Second, that attackers are targeting companies that have done the fiscally responsible thing and obtained cyberinsurance to mitigate their ransomware risks is a perverse form of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_selection">adverse selection</a>. I am sure the cyberinsurance industry is working out ways to incentivize their customers to reduce their ransomware risks, because that is what insurance companies do, but organizational inertia and lack of funding will make it difficult and time-consuming to succeed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>Ideally, companies and municipalities would keep their systems up to date through regular software packaging and hardware upgrades, and would inventory and back up their data, so that ransomware attacks would be less likely to succeed, and so that data could be restored without paying the ransom. Organizations could also reduce their attack surface in other ways, such as replacing Microsoft Windows with ChromeOS for classes of workers, such as call center workers, whose job functions do not require Microsoft Windows. ChromeOS is less likely to be attacked than Microsoft Windows, and its use would encourage centralized data storage and software, which are easier to keep up-to-date and secure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>Beyond hardware and software upgrades, organizations need to train their employees to recognize social engineering attacks, as that is the number one or two attack vector every year. Having gone through that training every year for many years, and having been tested at random by a program at my company, I have learned that social engineering attacks can be almost impossible to discern from legitimate emails and instant messages. I think that no amount of social engineering training is going to be more than 80% effective at preventing phishing and/or ransomware attacks, but 80% is a good start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>The main reason organizations do not put these controls and practices into place is money. The second is organizational inertia. Both can be solved, but only through additional resources and external pressure.  As citizens and as customers, we have to demand that the organizations, both public and private, that we interact with, protect their data and our data sufficiently.</p>

<p><p>As a ketogenic dieter, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/well/eat/the-keto-diet-is-popular-but-is-it-good-for-you.html">Anahad O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s article about ketogenic diets</a> is pretty balanced, but his premise, described in the block quote below, doesn&rsquo;t hold up to much scrutiny:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:quote -->

<p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Low-carbohydrate diets have fallen in and out of favor since before the days of Atkins. But now an even stricter version of low-carb eating called the ketogenic diet is gaining popular attention, igniting a fierce scientific debate about its potential risks and benefits.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>I am grateful that ketogenic diets are being treated seriously enough to be written about in a national newspaper. Unfortunately, the New York Times is trying to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teach_the_Controversy">teach the controversy</a>, when no such controversy actually exists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>Here are some clarifying points about some of the topics discussed or touched upon in the article, from someone who actually follows a sensible, low calorie, vegetable-rich ketogenic diet:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->

<p><ol><li>There is no &ldquo;Keto diet&rdquo;. There are a variety of <em>ketogenic</em> diets, all with the common element that they tend to put the body in a state of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis">nutritional ketosis</a> at some point (not all day long unless you fast; primarily while you are sleeping). All these diets involve restricting carbohydrate intake to very low levels, ranging from 0 g to about 50 g per day. They differ in meal composition, meal timing, and what foods are allowed or disallowed. Also, in real life, even people on ketogenic diets will eat a high-carbohydrate treat now and then.</li><li>Nutritional ketosis is not the same as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoacidosis">ketoacidosis</a>.</li><li>Ideally, ketogenic diets involve eating a great deal of high fiber (but low starch) vegetables. Imagine telling your doctor that you eat two huge salads per day, with four ounces of meat on them, one ounce of cheese, and a tablespoon or two of olive-oil-and-vinegar dressing. Doctors have told me that it is hard to eat healthier than that.</li><li>Ketogenic diets are&rdquo;high fat&rdquo;, on a <em>percentage basis</em>, not necessarily on an absolute basis (as in, grams of fat per day). </li><li>Similarly, ketogenic diets are not necessarily higher in meat or dairy consumption that the standard American diet.</li><li>I have read many, many abstracts and articles about diet and nutrition studies. Almost every study I have come across demonstrates bias or lack of understanding of what ketogenic diets actually look like (they tend not to restrict carbohydrates in test subjects sufficiently), relies on bad data (epidemiological data, or prior studies&rsquo; data, self-reported food logs), or have durations that are too short (you need more than a couple weeks to assess a diet change). </li><li>Sometimes the scientists&rsquo; own conclusions do not seem to be drawn from from the data they collected. This often evidences itself when the study concludes that, despite outcomes being equal or better for ketogenic diets, there is concern about their heart health due to the amount of fat in their diet.</li><li>While you may believe there is insufficient evidence that ketogenic diets are healthy (whatever that means), there is ample evidence that the standard American diet (which I understand has spread to most of the world at this point) is obviously not. It it were, there wouldn&rsquo;t be an obesity epidemic.</li><li>I don&rsquo;t believe it makes sense to adopt an all-meat, or all-meat-and-cheese, diet. My reasoning: Fermentation of high-fiber vegetable matter in the gut is something humans evolved to do, and, for that reason, it is probably a good idea to continue doing so. I would understand if this argument were made more clearly in the article; instead some scientist’s statement that mistakes &ldquo;high fiber&rdquo; foods with high carbohydrate foods (i.e. <em>starchy</em> foods) is there, casting doubt about about the diet in a way that doesn’t make logical sense.</li><li>Ketogenic diets are not appropriate for some people, due to underlying medical conditions such as Type I Diabetes. This does not mean that that are not appropriate for anybody.</li><li>In the end, we are all <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_of_1_trial">n = 1 studies</a>. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the science says about a diet&rsquo;s effect on study participants or on populations, it matters how the diet affects <em>you</em>. Many, many people have success with ketogenic diets that they did not have with low-fat diets or with calorie counting. If low-fat dieting or calories-in-calories-out tracking works for someone, it makes no sense to disparage that person’s diet choices, and almost no one would. Ketogenic diets should be treated the same way.<br></li></ol>

         	<p>I was finally brave enough to install Ubuntu Linux on the laptop sitting in my home office that serves as the family&rsquo;s Plex Media Server. It helped that Windows Update messed up and rendered the machine&rsquo;s original Windows 10 Home install unusable.</p>

<p>I got fed up trying to figure out how to fix Windows, so I burned a live USB installer for Ubuntu and tried it out. It worked very well, and made installing Plex Media Server a one-click operation. I turned Ubuntu&rsquo;s automatic updates off, and hope that it will run smoothly, and not reboot sometimes for updates, like Windows 10 does, going forward.</p>

<p>I am well aware that Windows 10 Home or an old laptop are not appropriate for a &ldquo;real&rdquo; server. Someday I will have the money to buy a proper computer for this task.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I got the Apple Card about a week ago, and just started using it this weekend. Here are some initial thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li>I very much like the security and privacy features Apple Pay and the Apple Card. I try to use Apple Pay whenever I can to take advantage of most of these features, no matter what card I was using.</li>
<li>I very much like the enhancements to the Wallet app on my iPhone to review transactions and spending.</li>
<li>2% cash back on all Apple Pay purchases seems like a pretty good benefit to me.</li>
<li>3% back on Apple transactions seems a little stingy, considering that Amazon and Target offer 5% back when you use their branded cards. I would get a much better cash-back rate buying an Apple product on Amazon, using my Amazon.com Visa.</li>
<li>The interest rate offered to me was the lowest that they offer, and it is a between two and three percentage points lower than the other cards I have. I never carry a balance, so it doesn’t mean much to me.</li>
<li>I had a false-alarm fraud alert shortly after I set it up. I made it my default on my Apple account, and a $30 annual subscription fee trigged a fraud alert. I contacted Apple Card support via iMessage, and cleared up the problem.</li>
<li>Buying different things changes the color of the card in the Wallet app, which is amusing. The colors correspond to the spending charts.</li>
<li>I had a lot of trouble adding the card to my Apple Watch. It took lots of fiddling with settings, but, fortunately, I did not have to unpair and repair the Apple Watch to my iPhone.</li>
<li>The titanium card is boring and heavy. I expect to never use it. Its best feature is that my card number is not printed on it.</li>
<li>Some common features are missing: a website, integration with personal finance applications, and joint accounts (or authorized users).</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Barnes &amp; Noble has been sliding toward oblivion for years. Nearly 400 stores have closed since 1997 — there are 627 now operating — and $1 billion in market value has evaporated in the last five years. This week, Elliott Advisors, the private equity firm that owns Waterstones, closed its deal to buy Barnes &amp; Noble for $683 million. Mr. Daunt will move to New York City this month and serve as the new chief executive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have lots of fond memories of Barnes &amp; Noble over the years—despite the fact that I liked Borders even better. My wife and kids still like it, so we go to the one closest to us pretty often. It is, in many ways, a sad, pale shadow of its former self. The Nook section is large and empty. It is easier to find toys in there than books. I don&rsquo;t really understand why they still sell so many DVDs and CDs in the back.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Frankly, at the moment you want to love Barnes &amp; Noble, but when you leave the store you feel mildly betrayed,” Mr. Daunt said over lunch at a Japanese restaurant near his office in Piccadilly Circus. “Not massively, but mildly. It’s a bit ugly — there’s piles of crap around the place. It all feels a bit unloved, the booksellers look a bit miserable, it’s all a bit run down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I keep wondering when our local store will shut its doors, though I don&rsquo;t want it to.  I am eager for a turnaround.</p>

<p>I wanted to know why Cage, Hollywood’s greatest surrealist, whose personal and creative unpredictability has led him to attain near-mythological status in certain corners of the internet, acts in so many movies — 20 in the last two years — and why so few of them make mainstream ripples. (His most recent release: the straightforwardly titled thriller “A Score to Settle.”) But mostly I wanted to know the method behind the seeming madness that informs so many of his performances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is a pretty fascinating read, even if, like me, you only have a casual familiarity with Nick Cage&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>In a big shift, Facebook plans to signal its control of Instagram and WhatsApp by adding its name to both apps, according to three people familiar with the matter. The social network will rebrand the apps to “Instagram from Facebook” and “WhatsApp from Facebook,” the people said.</p>

<p>This is bound to end badly for Facebook. I can think of no one who thinks Facebook is a strong brand, let alone stronger than Instagram or WhatsApp.</p>

         	<p>My wife and I learned today that my two-year-old son has severe peanut allergies. My daughter does too, so at least we know what to do, but it is very unfortunate news. It is a deadly serious condition. There are so many foods that peanut allergy suffers can’t eat—most of which don’t even have peanuts in them, but are processed on equipment that also processes peanuts—that most packaged foods are disallowed. Most candy is unsafe. Hard ice cream, at restaurants and ice cream places, isn’t safe either, because it or the scoops used to scoop it get cross-contaminated with peanuts. Fortunately, we have found some peanut-free sources for foods like chocolate, and can bake our own treats at home. With two peanut-allergy-having kids, I think I’m going to be baking a lot of cakes at home from now on (for every birthday party, ever), and learning how to make things like chocolate candy and maybe even homemade ice cream.</p>

<p>For more than 80 years, Tanglewood, the bucolic summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, has made the Berkshires a vital destination for classical music.</p>

<p>Now it is getting into the talk business, too.</p>

<p>Listening to classical music, at and after sunset, on Tanglewood&rsquo;s great lawn is one of my fondest memories. Going to see a lecture there would be fun, too, I guess.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>From what I have heard of Sleater-Kinney&rsquo;s new album, &ldquo;<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-center-wont-hold/1463695430">The Center Won&rsquo;t Hold</a>&rdquo;, it certainly sounds different than their older stuff. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/arts/music/sleater-kinney-st-vincent.html?action=click&amp;module=Well&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;section=Arts">This arcticle</a>, by Melena Rezwik, in the New York Times, provides some context <em>why</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since its self-titled 1995 debut, Sleater-Kinney has been revered as one of indie rock&rsquo;s most musically fierce and lyrically sharp bands, cutting a path for passionate musicians who refuse to check their politics or their emotions at the club door. The band’s signature sound — Brownstein and Tucker’s guitars and vocals winding around each other in stinging counterpoint, anchored by Weiss’s deft, thundering drumming — always relied on its precise chemistry. On the eve of its ninth studio album, Sleater-Kinney is now skimmed down to its founding duo, Tucker, 46, and Brownstein, 44.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sleater-Kinney was a big part of the soundtrack to my 20s and early 30s. They were magnificent, and I am happy they are still making music, even if they are now down a member. I can&rsquo;t wait for their entire new album to drop on August 16.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The once obscure congressman from El Paso who brought in an astounding nearly $80 million in his Senate race reported a measly $3.6 million, way down from his $9.4 million in the first quarter. Jay Inslee is gaining on him. How did this happen? Many answers lie in the difference between running for office in Texas and running nationally. The first showed all of Mr. O’Rourke’s strengths, and the second each and every weakness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my opinion, Beto is running the wrong race. I think he would have a legitimate shot at winning Cornyn&rsquo;s senate seat in Texas, and that he has wasted valuable time pursuing the presidency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sony may have only released the RX100 VI last year, but the company is already back with an updated model called the RX100 VII.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am excited to see that Sony is still revving its RX100 camera. I have an RX100 Mark I, which I don&rsquo;t use too much any more, since I got a micro 4/3 camera, but I still love it. It takes great pictures, is incredibly versatile, and fits in a relatively tiny belt-loop holster case, so I can take it anywhere. It may be slower than a smartphone camera, and have fewer features than a more recent model, but it still takes great pictures, and is pretty easy to use as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The RX100 VII will be available later in August 2019 for $1,200 for the camera alone. Later in 2019, the aforementioned Shooting Grip Kit bundle will be available for $1,300. It will be available for preorder at B&amp;H Photo and Adorama later today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s an over-$1,000 pocket camera, though, which is a market segment that sounds like it shouldn&rsquo;t even exist. I bought my Mark I used for $300, right after the RX-100 Mark II was released. Since then, owners have been more keen on selling their old ones for much higher prices, which has kept me from upgrading. Maybe someday I will pick up one from a few generations back.</p>

         	<p>I enjoyed reading this article from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/magazine/electronic-music-synthesizers.html">New York Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Estrada was playing a Pocket Operator, a device released four years ago by a Swedish company called Teenage Engineering. To date, the company has made nine different models of the same basic design, and it has sold more than 350,000 of them worldwide, making the Pocket Operator one of the most popular synthesizers in history. The Korg M1 — famous for producing the sound of Seinfeld’s slap bass and Madonna’s “Vogue,” and one of the best-selling and most influential synths of all time — is estimated to have sold 100,000 fewer units over nearly twice as much time. The “portable” version of one of the Pocket Operator’s earliest forebears — the telharmonium, constructed more than a hundred years ago — cost more than $5 million to build in today’s dollars, weighed 200 tons and required a team of specialists to achieve peak performance. A Pocket Operator costs about $60 and fits in the palm of your hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The pocket synth by Teenage Engineering, the company that designed Panic&rsquo;s upcoming <a href="https://play.date">PlayDate</a> handheld gaming console, looks really cool. I kind of want to pick one up, even though I no longer consider myself a musician of any kind.</p>

         	<p>I think that every bit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/07/16/us/politics/democratic-fundraising-2020.html">of this article from the New York Times</a> illustrates what is wrong with the way we pick presidents in the US.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Five Democratic presidential candidates raised a combined $96 million from individual donors in the last three months — about three-quarters of the total fund-raising by the entire Democratic field, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission on Monday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to admit that I am annoyed because my favorite candidate is not at the top of the fundraising list. That is a small worry, though. Overall, I am annoyed that all this money is spread out so widely amongst candidates,
many of whom should gracefully drop out and run for lower, but still very important, offices.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Trump looms over everything like Calamity Ganon over Hyrule Castle in &ldquo;Breath of the Wild&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump has more than twice as much cash as the best-funded Democrats.</p>

<p>President Trump has a big head start on the Democratic field in raising money for the 2020 election. He ended the second quarter with far more cash on hand than even the best-funded Democratic candidate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think the Democratic candidates and campaign strategists have a real plan to win. I know there is still a good amount of time to make such a plan, but I’m not sure if there is enough time. I am already tired of the primary process, and it has barely even begun.</p>

<ul>
<li>A VPN server</li>
<li>A self-hosted RSS back-end for Reeder (accessible via the VPN)</li>
<li>A download server that connects to my NAS (I used to use a Raspberry Pi for this, but it was really, really slow)</li>
</ul>

<p>I could, of course, replace all of these single-purpose servers with a single Intel box running virtual machines. I have not found such a thing at a good price, or that runs silently. My NAS box, currently running FreeNAS, is off limits right now when it comes to adding Internet-facing services. It is also too old and under-resourced to dedicate chunks of its RAM to virtual machines.</p>

<p>Facebook doesn’t have much consumer trust. But it does have a hell of a lot of consumers.</p>

<p>And that’s enough to make Libra, the new virtual coin that Facebook is announcing on Tuesday, the most consequential cryptocurrency effort undertaken in several years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have done a lot of research on cryptocurrencies for work, and keep coming back to my thoughts that they are a scam. Bitcoin works like a pyramid scheme, where the early adopters (the early miners) gain the lions share of wealth, once the value of the coin increases, due to the way that mining works. In the best case scenario of cryptocurrency use, some companies will do an end run around the current financial system intermediaries, and insert themselves as the <em>new</em> financial system intermediaries.

         	<p>SwiftUI is definitely the way forward for development on all Apple platforms, and I am excited about it. That said, it is only going to be supported on new OS releases going forward. My plan is to support the current version of iOS and macOS going forward for at least a year, which will make it challenging for me to switch my UI code to SwiftUI at that time. Next fall, however, when Apple&rsquo;s OS cycle turns over again, would be a great time for me to finish up SwiftUI-based rewrites and push them to production. I have a lot of prep work I can do in the meantime.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SwiftUI is not compatible with earlier versions of iOS, macOS, or any of Apple’s other operating systems. So, to start adopting it, you either need to decide that it’s acceptable for the app in which you’ll use SwiftUI to only work on the latest operating systems — or you’ll need to ”gate off” the features written in Swift UI from older versions, using Swift’s @available syntax.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found this post by <a href="https://micro.blog/johnsundell">@johnsundell</a> to be a very useful, concise explanation of what I need to know right now about Swift UI.</p>

<p>Right off the bat, it tells me that I can wait a little while to adopt it. My time this year would be better served refactoring my codebase to prepare for a SwiftUI transition next year. For example, I can already start work on getting rid of storyboards in SwiftoDo for iOS, and that will prepare me for the storyboard-free future with SwiftUI.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2019/05/13/game-of-thrones.html">Game of Thrones Season 8 has become yet another thing for everyone to be angry about</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2019/05/13/game-of-thrones.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-05-13 10:13:50 -0400">May 13, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I did not hate the latest &ldquo;Game of Thrones&rdquo; episode. I actually liked it, thought it was effective, and thought it made sense. This <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/game-of-thrones-recap-season-8-episode-5-the-bells.html">recap from Vulture</a> describes the way I feel about it pretty accurately.</p>

<p>Of course, having browsed the web since the penultimate episode aired, I now think that I am in the minority opinion. People are <em>so angry</em> about what is going on in this season that I am quite taken aback. I suppose a lot of these complainers have not seen &ldquo;Lost&rdquo; or &ldquo;Battlestar Galactica&rdquo;, and have no idea how a top-tier series can <em>really</em> go off the rails at the end.</p>

<p>I think that I have been telling myself the ending will be disappointing for so long now that I am not even disappointed by whatever weaknesses and expectation shortfalls I see in it. My theory about all stories is that they are most exciting when they are <em>beginning</em>. Great epic stories are always beginning and beginning and beginning. The world of the story keeps expanding, as do all the life and possibilities within it. At some point, though, the story has to end, and the world built for it starts to contract. This is always disappointing. Things don&rsquo;t happen that you want to happen. Narrative threads end, or simply get dropped. Questions get answered (and questions are always more interesting than answers) or, maybe, not answered. Characters don&rsquo;t always develop or act in ways that you have imagined them. The author&rsquo;s vision of the endgame may not align yours. When the story ends, it contracts down to a single point, and what is left may not be what you want. Even if it is, you are sad to leave your favorite characters and story ideas behind.</p>

<p>To sum up, there are many reasons why endings are disappointing, and there is almost nothing that can be done to help that in certain genres. &ldquo;Game of Thrones&rdquo; has been in this trap for a while now, and has thus far avoided the worst of all television series fates, for me at least: I still want to watch the ending and find out what happens.</p>

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2019/05/08/bye-bye-homebridge.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-05-08 23:19:54 -0400">May 8, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I noticed an email from Google in my Spam folder this evening (copied, by someone else, <a href="https://github.com/KraigM/homebridge-nest/issues/203">here</a>) stating that the Works with Nest API is shutting down on August 31. That&rsquo;s the API that makes my Nest work with HomeKit, via the <a href="https://github.com/KraigM/homebridge-nest">homebridge-nest</a> plugin. It is yet another mildly upsetting thing Google is doing that involves killing a product that some people use.</p>

<p>I have had a Nest thermostat for years—well before Google even owned Nest. It is the only smart thermostat that I know of that will work in my house, because I do not have a common wire (which carries low-voltage power) in my heating and air conditioning system, and have no easy access to power near the Nest itself. (The Nest handles that situation just fine, but the other products I have researched, such as the Ecobee, would not.)</p>

<p>Overall, the Nest is OK. Its most important feature for me is that can be set via Wifi. The Nest application, however, is slow to load, buggy, and, if anything, has gotten worse over the years as Nest has added support for its other, non-thermostat products. It often forces me to log in again to my Google account (which is a multi-step process), and does not integrate with Siri or the iOS Control Center. Homebridge solved all those software limitations for me, but was dependent on this developer API that is now going away.</p>

<p>I hope that Google will provide a new API that I can use with Homebridge going forward, but at this point, I doubt that they will. On the plus side, I guess I can unplug the Raspberry Pi I have been running on.</p>

         	<p>My FreeNAS server is back <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2019/05/07/freenas-server-i.html">from the dead</a>. After it stopped working and wouldn&rsquo;t boot, I needed to plug in a monitor with a VGA connector (which I didn&rsquo;t have yesterday) to see what was going on. It turns out that the boot drive, a USB stick, had failed.</p>

<p>Luckily, I have a couple other USB sticks lying around, and I had saved the FreeNAS configuration to my Mac recently. I was able to re-install FreeNAS to a new USB stick, re-upload my old configuration, and I lost no data or settings.</p>

<p>I think I will buy two identical USB sticks in the near future and mirror the boot drives. I would prefer this server to just run until the motherboard or power supply dies. This short period of downtime made me question whether I should even <em>have</em> a home server (or at least <em>this</em> home server), which is a question that I don&rsquo;t really want to spend time thinking about right now.</p>

         	<p>So&hellip;my new SwiftoDo Desktop app for the Mac would be 100% complete right now, if I hadn&rsquo;t decided, 75% of the way through writing it, to add a secondary edit mode for the todo.txt file. That mode makes the user interface comparable to the iOS version of SwiftoDo, but is also loads better in subtle ways, such as being able to reload the file (in either mode) if an external editor (such as iCloud Drive) modifies the underlying task list file. Of course, that makes everything so much harder to implement in a bug-free way. I have been discovering and trying to fix bugs over the past week or so. I have been messing with the lowest-level code in my app far more than I would normally be doing at this stage in the game. I&rsquo;m trying to finish up the version and release it soon. I will get there, but it makes me nervous to jump back into file coordination related bugs, when I thought I had perfected those features almost six months ago.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>I have found that my home server hobby is more a “moving files around” hobby. I have reached this conclusion based on the countless times I have found myself moving files from one place to another.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->

<p><h2>My FreeNAS media server</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>I have run <a href="https://www.freenas.org">FreeNAS</a> on a <a href="https://n40l.fandom.com/wiki/HP_MicroServer_N40L_Wiki">HP N54L Microserver</a> for over five years. It has been a fantastic server. I bought it, a slightly used review unit, loaded with four 500 GB drives that it would not have normally come with, for a song—less than a new one with no storage drives included. Over the years, I updated the storage (now I have 16 TB total, with 8 TB usable space, set up in a single RAIDZ2 volume), and the RAM (from 8 GB to 16 GB). Over that same time period, 8 TB went from an impressive amount of storage to something a relatively inexpensive single drive could handle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>What those single drives don’t have, however, is redundancy and data integrity features. My little FreeNAS server has that, thanks to the ZFS file system. At several times in my home media streaming career, the external hard drive I used to store my media files died, and I lost all my data. Thankfully, no important personal data, like my photos, was ever lost, but the experience was upsetting enough not to want to repeat any more. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>Hard drive failures can happen to anyone, at any time, even if you have a nice server rather than a Raspberry Pi with an external hard drive attached via USB. Less than a year after I upgraded my FreeNAS server’s drives, one of them failed. The  FreeNAS server emailed me about the error, and its UI showed that my drive array was operating in a degraded state. I quickly ordered a new drive, swapped it out the next day, and never lost a bit of data. (I returned the failed drive for a free replacement, so now I have a replacement available, in case I ever need it.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->

<p><h2>File servers fill up, if you let them</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>FreeNAS has been stable, reliable, and a joy to use. One thing I have learned from running it, however, is that its file system, ZFS, degrades in performance when a volume (a pool of drives) is more than 80% full. FreeNAS will warn you about this threshold, but I never took it too seriously, because poor performance is mostly an academic concern when all you are doing with a server is transferring a few gigabytes a day. I do like to silence warnings, however, so I normally have to prune my media collection, or move some videos I want to keep, but am unlikely to watch again soon, to external, mostly cold, storage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>Of course, where is that old, external drive with my files on it? I have no idea. So, this week, when my FreeNAS server filled up way over the 80% warning threshold, I decided, rather than continuing to free space by deleting movies and TV series that I didn’t want to delete, to add some more redundant storage to my network, and move the old files there. This decision was mostly based on having some extra hardware lying around, unused. I have a <a href="https://www.seagate.com/support/network-attached-storage/business-storage/seagate-nas/">2 TB, two-bay Seagate NAS</a>, which is a little, Linux-based server with a consumer friendly web UI for administration. Unlike FreeNAS, it is very locked down, and unlike my HP microserver, it has only two drive bays rather than four.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>At any rate, I set that up again and started moving some files to it, which sounds simpler than it really is. I am cherry picking files that are less likely to be accessed to the new server, so I have to go through everything I have, to some extent. Because the files either number in the thousands (like music files) or are multiple gigabytes in size (like video files), moving them has been very slow. Because the Seagate NAS’s filesystem (EXT4) is different than the FreeNAS filesystem (ZFS), there are other interesting problems, like file naming rules, that trip up file transfers. Because these are two different UNIX-like systems with different users configured on them, sometimes there are permissions issues that prevent files from being moved, renamed, or deleted. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>As cool as it is to stream movies and music throughout my house, making it all work requires, from time to time, a lot of low-level file transfers. It has been taking a lot more time and attention than I would like.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I listened to this <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carole_cadwalladr_facebook_s_role_in_brexit_and_the_threat_to_democracy">TED Talk</a> yesterday, via the TED podcast. Carole Cadwalladr&rsquo;s message was chilling but not at all surprising, considering just how much news there is about how Facebook (mostly) is abused to undermine trust in facts, in institutions, in each other, and, ultimately, in democratic elections.</p>

<p>Dark money flowing into ephemeral, misleading, highly-targeted advertising is rightly identified as the leading cause of these problems. Sometimes I think that if the advertising element were removed from Facebook, a lot of these problems go away. After all, isn&rsquo;t the problem that people can pay to publish whatever they want, targeted to whoever they want, and there is no tradable record of it anywhere thereafter? But after thinking about it for a little while longer, I think that the advertisements are only part of the problem. The algorithms that target content, wherever it comes from, to the most engaged (most gullible?) users, are another huge part of the problem. People will spread <em>user</em>-generated misleading nonsense almost as fast as the targeted advertisements will spread.</p>

<p>I have concluded that the human brain isn&rsquo;t well adapted to the scale, speed, and the algorithmic targeting of information that social media sites. Those are the very things that make a site like Facebook work. These kind of websites are flawed because our brains are flawed. That&rsquo;s a problem that is not possible to solve.</p>

         	<p>The burning of Notre Dame shook me to my core yesterday.</p>

<p>The images and videos made me so upset that I thought I was going crazy. After all, it is just a building, and presumably no one died, so what is the big deal? Still, the cathedral is a symbol of beauty and hope—literally of reaching to the sky to a higher power—and, to me at least, of human achievement, collective action, and indomitable spirit. To see it, a world monument, burning up (and potentially collapsing altogether, though thankfully that did not happen) deeply troubled me.</p>

<p>I have thought about it a little more now, and have realized something: When upsetting things occur, it makes sense to be upset, even if what is happening isn&rsquo;t <em>the most</em> upsetting thing that could occur. Feeling so bad wasn&rsquo;t really a bad thing for my me, and it wasn&rsquo;t an outsized emotion to something that wasn&rsquo;t really affecting me. I&rsquo;m not crazy; I&rsquo;m <em>sensitive</em>, and that&rsquo;s OK.</p>

<p><p>I was poking around my iTunes library, found an old album I loved from senior year of high school, by a local Connecticut band called Mr. Right. After some Google searches, I found a copy of a song that was one of my all-time, lost, never-had-it-on-a-proper-CD, never-could-get-it-anywhere songs: “<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/temporary/5980546?i=5980528">Temporary</a>”. It wasn’t what I expected, however. It was a different arrangement, which was entirely unexpected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>When I first heard “Temporary”, it was a power pop song, recorded by Mr. Right (or maybe just <a href="http://www.hartford.edu/hartt/about-us/faculty/music/music-industry/jim-chapdelaine.aspx">Jim Chapdelaine</a>). Apparently, he dusted the song off almost ten years later to record with his new band, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/feathermerchants/featured">Feathermerchants</a>, and reimagined it as a folk-rock (dare I say, Americana?) ballad, sung by a feather-light soprano. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>When I was seventeen, I recorded, with my high school band, an EP weeks before we all left for college. Due to dumb luck (one of our friends grew up next door to a bonafide music producer—and the knew each other), two of our four-song EP was recorded, mixed, and mastered by <a href="http://westhartfordmagazine.com/musician-husband-father-cancer-survivor/">Jim Chapdelaine</a>, who went on to become a 13-time Emmy winner, among other amazing things. We first met up with him because his band at the time (in 1995), Mr. Right, played a gig at my hometown&rsquo;s annual fall festival on the green. My friends and I pretty much idolized him for a little while after high school graduation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>Jim played a recording of the original song through his board as we were waiting for something to happen—probably while we were waiting for our gold master CD to be written, at 1/2X speed, in Jim’s basement music studio. The chorus is an ear worm, and I really enjoy the lyric. I remembered it to this day, and hearing it made me feel nostalgic.</p>

<p><p>This weekend was great.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>On Saturday, my wife and I took the kids to the Staten Island Zoo. One of my wife’s best friends is the director of education there, and she gave us (my 6-year-old daughter, mostly) a private tour. We all had a great time, and my daughter had an absolute blast. She loved everything about it, and got to touch a bunch of animals (sheet, goats, birds, snakes, lizards, an armadillo, a rabbit, and a chinchilla) that we never through she would touch. (You can’t touch most of these animals unless you’re on a field trip or you know someone who works there.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>On Sunday, my wife and I took the kids to one park in the morning and let them play a long time. My 2-year-old son, of course, only wanted to be pushed on the swing, but my daughter wanted to climb and jump and slide and dig in the same, and so on. We had a blast. I took her to another park in the afternoon, where she played for hours, blew bubbles, and made some little friends. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><p>It was great to be able to watch my kids learn and play all weekend. We didn’t go too far from home, or spend that much money, but we all had a great time together.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>For someone who is, now, only marginally interested in television and movies, I have spent a lot of time and money over the years to make my television watching experience awesome. I used to be <em>really</em> into it, and—unless you had a lot of money to burn—it used to be hard to get it working correctly, which fed into my engineering mindset and led me to tinker with hardware and software frequently, for almost a decade.</p>

<p>I started in 2008 by connecting my 13” white MacBook to my (non-HD) TV via a $30 video adapter. Even though my TV was primitive, picture quality was way better when playing video this way, and I could watch streaming videos directly from the networks’ web sites, like “Lost”, on my real TV for the first time. I loved it. After about a year of this, I got a mini-PC as a Christmas gift, which I started using, with an external hard drive, as a home media server.</p>

<p>For the front end, I bought a set-top box that Western Digital used to sell. The system worked&hellip;mostly. Streaming over WiFi was reliable for non-HD (480p) and 720p HD encoded TV shows, but anything with higher resolutions, higher bit rates, or DTS audio would usually be impossible to play.</p>

<p>I was never serious enough to buy an expensive computer to connect to my TV, because I figured, correctly it turns out, that video streaming devices would become cheaper and more capable over time. Of course, during that time, I cycled through a <em>ton</em> of set-top boxes (most of which I got for free as review units): Roku boxes, a couple Roku knock-offs, the Boxee Box, the first Amazon Fire TV, an Amazon Fire TV Stick (which was quickly returned), a couple Raspberry Pis running XMBC (which worked great for TV but stumbled on DTS audio), and eventually a number of Apple TVs (fourth generation).</p>

<p>The reason I went through so many front-ends is that they all had two limitations. First, each one left out at least one of the top video sources: either iTunes, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, or Plex. (Nothing left out Netflix.) Second, all of them choked on certain sorts of videos, depending on their audio or video encodings.</p>

<p>Eventually, I began to watch video on my iPad while I work. This led me to discover Plex in the App Store. Plex is a server that you can install on a computer, coupled with client apps that run on many different devices. Plex looks great, has server side transcoding to make video formats less of an issue, and allows you to manage a centralized library of TV, movies, music, and more. I used Plex on an Amazon Fire TV for a year or two. I started out very happy with it, but the software stability of the Amazon Fire TV decreased over time, and Plex and Amazon did not release software updates timely enough to fix it. Eventually, I was very unhappy with the Fire TV + Plex combo, but still pretty happy running Plex on my iPad.</p>

<p>When the Apple TV, 4th generation, was released, with support for iTunes, Apple Music, Netflix, YouTube, and Plex, I bought one right away. I figured, at the time, that Apple was so big that only it had any chance to get all the major video providers on a single box, and get them to stay long term. (Amazon, of course, was conspicuously absent for several years, but that was not as important to me back then as it is now.) I didn’t expect to love it for to watch baseball on MLB At Bat, but it plays games at 1080p/60fps, which looks amazing, so I <em>do</em>.</p>

<p>Over time, home media streaming went from being a niche hobby, in which nerds like me tried to hook up computers to their TVs, to a very mainstream way to consume video and audio. Thanks to cheap and nearly ubiquitous modern hardware, my home media streaming “hobby”, has basically come to an end. I still maintain a Plex library, but I no longer have to upgrade or to fiddle with hardware connected to my TV, or worry about audio and video encodings and bit rates before I watch a movie with my wife. I also stream a lot more video from outside the home (not via Plex) than I ever did before—just like everybody else these days. It’s not special any more; it’s just another entertainment product, and it deserves very little thought, because it just works. Things are much better now, but sometimes I do miss tinkering with hardware.</p>

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2019/03/27/apple-card.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-03-27 20:00:00 -0400">Mar 27, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Apple announced Apple Card at its event on Monday. Details are incomplete, but its announcement excited me more than the media-related services Apple announced at the same event. Perhaps that is because I pay for things every day, but don’t watch much TV, and my wife and I are happy with our New Yorker subscription (she reads the physical magazine; I read it online) and our New York Times subscription (which we both read via its iOS app).</p>

<p>Apple Card interests me because I use Apple Pay all the time, and Apple Card’s Apple Pay-specific cash back rewards are a 33% better than what I get from either of my two current credit cards on the things I purchase most. From a pure spending and getting rewards perspective, Apple Card seems like a winner to me.</p>

<p>I am a somewhat baffled, however, at the Apple commentators’ many takes on how Apple Card&rsquo;s rewards are mediocre. I <em>suppose</em> that may be the case for people who want travel rewards, but if you want cash back <em>and</em> can use Apple Pay at your local supermarkets and restaurants, Apple Card is a winner.</p>

<p>I base my opinion on lots of research into the best cash back cards. For the past twenty years, I have been a cash-back-rewards seeker who researches credit cards on NerdWallet and BankRate at least once a year, and occasionally jumps from one card to another. Based on my research, I already have the best credit cards <em>for me</em>, from a rewards perspective. Apple&rsquo;s credit card&rsquo;s cash back rewards system is better than all of them, again, <em>for me</em>. Two percent cash back on all Apple Pay purchases would increase the cash back I get from my largest non-mortgage monthly expense category, supermarket spending, from 1.5% to 2%.</p>

<p>I heard on <a href="https://twit.tv">TWIT</a> this week that Apple Card does not have certain protections most credit cards come from, like purchase price protection and extended warranties. That doesn&rsquo;t matter to me, though, as I have not used those benefits in the 20+ years I have had a credit card.</p>

<p>Apple Card’s announced interest rates fall within what I think is a normal range. Each customer’s interest rate will depend on their credit rating, so it is technically unknown until each person applies for it. Apple has not made it clear whether there is a monthly billing cycle with an interest-free grace period, which is common. This leads to more uncertainty about it, as better cash back rewards are not helpful if you have to pay interest on every purchase. I almost never carry a credit card balance, though, so whatever Apple&rsquo;s interest rate is for me, and provided there is a normal grace period for purchases, it does not matter.</p>

<p>All in all, Apple Card sounds like a good deal for a lot of Apple’s customers.</p>

         	<p>I have been working pretty steadily on finishing version 4.0 of SwiftoDo Desktop. I feel pretty good about the app, in general. It is coded in Swift now, as opposed to Objective C, and has a much more mature, and hopefully easy to support, architecture.</p>

<p>It will be a massive upgrade from version 3. While I would like to charge for it, even for my current customers, I feel bad enough about drastically changing an app I sold, even if it is for the better, that I am strongly considering just releasing it as a free upgrade. That&rsquo;s basically my plan for the next version of SwiftoDo on iOS, which will be based on this codebase as much as possible.</p>

<p>My day job has been super interesting lately. I have hundreds of data analysis work papers to write, and I coded some pretty sophisticated scripts to generate all the data analytics I need to run, review, and report on. If only the software I was using made it easier to generate my work papers. I still have days and days of work ahead of me writing all the work papers that document the process. I also re-learned today about VBA’s superannuated support for interfaces, polymorphism, and delegation, for another project I am working on.</p>

<p>My wife has been baking cookies for Purim this week, which is a lot of fun, but incredibly tempting to me, as I have been on a low-carb diet the past few weeks. I have to loose all the weight I gained over the past 14 months, due to stress- and grief-related overeating. I am using MyFitnessPal, once again, to track my eating. I have also been doing low-paced treadmill workouts in the evenings, though not every night. So far, my diet and exercise regime has gone really well, but sweets can still be tempting.</p>

<p>One new wrinkle in parenting that my family is dealing with is that my two-year-old son has recently developed separation anxiety, which is normal at his age. It has lead to a good deal of interrupted sleep late at night, when he wakes up and screams &ldquo;Mommy!&rdquo; My wife bears the brunt of it, though. He cries for her, but not for me. I am definitely second banana during these intermittent nighttime terrors.</p>

         	<p>I am going to try to post a journal entry now and then, because I have been neglecting my blog, and even <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me">my micro blog</a>, for a long while now.</p>

<p>Today was a good day.</p>

<p>At work, I automated a data analysis process—and, just as importantly, the work paper creation process associated with it—that I will have to run about sixty times for one of my current projects. I am hopeful that all the effort will have been worth it when I can start using it next week.</p>

<p>I <em>am</em> stressing myself out a little bit while doing this work, though, because it would look like I spent the past day or two not moving forward on actual <em>output</em> at all, even though moving forward next week will be much more efficient. I always have to compare the time it will take me to automate parts of my work with the time it will take me to simply ground it out. Of course, both time estimates are usually just guesses for me, because most of my work is one-off project work, which is never repeated (at least not in the same way) on the next project. Luckily for me, I have the weekend off to forget about time and budget pressure for a couple days.</p>

<p>My daughter passed level 50 in Reading Eggs tonight, which she does at school and at home on her Chromebook. I am very proud of her. She has recently started working much harder at learning to read. My wife and I have been pushing her a little harder lately, too, and even hired her a reading tutor (who is super nice) to help her. The best thing to happen about it this week is that we are now all on the same page about, and saying aloud to each other, that increasing her reading skills is the top priority. It helps to be able to prioritize things.</p>

<p>My son probably will never need a reading tutor, but he will need to go to preschool in the fall, and my wife and I have to figure out how to pay for it. We have already started scaling back our expenses (mainly monthly subscriptions and dining out), but have not gone into full-on budget mode just yet. We have started talking about money again, which is good. We may start using YNAB again, but I don’t care for the price of their subscription.</p>

<p>I have been working on a huge update to one of my apps,  SwiftoDo Desktop, which is a todo.txt task list manager for the Mac. The current version is super old now, and I re-wrote it from scratch, basing the model code on the iOS version I have been working on for a couple years now. At this point, the new Mac version is even better than the iOS version, but it is still not ready for release. Based on the brief time I can work on it, late at night, I imagine I have several weeks to go before I can release it.</p>

<p>Also, today, I released a bug fix update to one of my other apps, <a href="https://simplecallblockerapp.com">Simple Call Blocker</a>. I fixed a bug that made its call blocking extension not load for a lot of people. It turns out the problem had to do with calling an Apple API incorrectly—and I think the rules changed since I initially released the app, because it used to work without a problem. I had thought the bug was related to the app’s Core Data stack, which I had no way to fix, but it turned out to be something different. It feels good to fix that bug, and hopefully put a stop to all the customer emails I get about it.</p>

         	<p>As of today, my <em>second</em> 2017 iPad Pro has <em>also</em> developed backlight bleed on the bottom edge of the screen. (I have a charging stand, and use my iPad Pro almost like a desktop computer, so there is a definite &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; to it.) I got my first iPad Pro replaced for the same reason after about 11 months. The replacement&rsquo;s screen has been perfect for about nine months since then, but just started to exhibit the same problem today.</p>

<p>I wonder what is causing it. I hope it is not due to charging, pretty much exclusively, by the Smart Connector, because that&rsquo;s how I have it set up. Anyhow, I am stuck with it now for a good, long time, because it is out of warranty and was very, very expensive. Hopefully I can train myself to un-see it.</p>

<p>Hollow Knight developer Team Cherry surprised fans this morning by announcing a full sequel to 2017’s bug-filled metroidvania game, called Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hollow Knight is a cool, atmospheric, and thoughtfully crafted game. I&rsquo;m only a couple hours into it, and have just developed my skills enough to feel that it isn&rsquo;t too hard anymore. (I just beat a huge boss that I failed to default a half dozen times already.)
It is amazing to think that it was created by only two people. Hopefully the sequel will succeed and Team Cherry will continue making great games.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In 2001 I paid $14.99 for a lifetime account at <a href="https://vfemail.net">VFEmail</a>. I used it as my primary email host for a short time, as it was a pretty inexpensive IMAP email host back in the days when getting IMAP support outside of college or corporate email systems was quite rare. I stopped using it because it would go down from time to time, which is frustrating. I now use it only to get status emails sent by my home server (FreeNAS), which are relatively unimportant and anonymous. I keep thinking about using it more, because I love pure IMAP email, but now I am glad I did not.</p>

<p>I saw today that mail could not be fetched, and I found out that VFEmail was hacked, and everything for its US customers (including me, of course) has been destroyed. This is the message on the home page right now:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>!!!ALERT!!!! Update Feb 11 2019
www.vfemail.net and mail.vfemail.net are currently unavailable.
We have suffered catastrophic destruction at the hands of a hacker, last seen as aktv@94.155.49.9
This person has destroyed all data in the US, both primary and backup systems. We are working to recover what data we can.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is just devastating. Fortunately for me, I am not very much affected by the data loss, but I wonder how the other customers must feel.</p>

<p>VFEmail is a very small company. Originally it was just one guy. I feel really bad for him (or them, or whoever is running it now). I hope it can recover.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As is typical, much of that increase can be attributed to mobile gaming, which accounted for more than half of this per-device average. However, more substantial growth took place in the categories outside of gaming — including those categories where subscription-based apps tend to rule the top charts, the firm found.</p>

<p>I bet app spending is going to go up each year for the next few years, partly because people will spend less on hardware upgrades, and partly because software is becoming way more important than hardware in mobile now that the market has matured.</p>

         	<p>I will be very surprised if iOS 13 does not contain a system dark mode, and all the new system colors and colors API that debuted on the Mac last year. I think it may have a huge impact on iOS design, though, which may be a reason why the default system design is going to get an overhaul, too.</p>

         	<p>I hope that iOS 13 brings a Files app update that will add direct access to file shares. Until then, I will use a utility that I found today: <a href="https://www.skyjos.com/fileexplorer/">FE File Explorer</a>. It is a clean and polished file explorer that connects to Apple and Windows file shares, as well as some cloud services. It is a good image player, audio player, and video player as well. The Pro version integrates with the Files app as a data provider, too. I am impressed.</p>

         	<p>Sometimes, as a developer, I get stuck. This week, I have been stuck by some kind of endless loop or retain cycle that rears its head when I try to access a lazy-loaded class property within a subclass of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsdocument">NSDocument</a> by <em>two</em> child view controllers. Everything worked flawlessly until I added that second view controller. I am at my wits end, and it&rsquo;s all my fault.</p>

<p>I have tried to access that property only synchronously via a dispatch queue. I have tried making the property <em>not</em> load lazily. I have tried a bunch of other workarounds over the past half-week, but the one that is working is to delay one of the view controller&rsquo;s accesses of that property by <em>zero</em> seconds (which moves the call to the next run loop). That is a hack, but necessary right now for me to continue developing the app.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m going to stick with my workaround until the new view controller is completed. After that, I probably have to rip up a bunch of clever code and find a simpler, more straightforward way to set everything up in my NSDocument subclass and its window controller.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://www.recode.net/2019/2/1/18207198/spotify-gimlet-podcast-acquisition">Spotify&rsquo;s reported offer to buy Gimlet Media</a> for an estimated $200 milliion makes me think that the podcasting market is really <em>a lot</em> bigger than I had previously thought.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Podcasting is a small industry, with an ad model that generated an estimated $315 million in 2017. Digital video ads, by comparison, generated $11.9 billion in the same year. But it is growing quickly, which makes it attractive to some platforms and publishers (including Vox Media) who are interested in tapping new revenue streams.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the $315 million annual podcasting revenue estimate is low. I bet that advertisers are at the point where they all agree that podcasting&rsquo;s mix of old school, host-read ad reads, and new school analytics and targeting, are making it a really good deal for advertisers. I expect a lot more podcast network deals in the next year or two.</p>

<p>The most intensely focused music listening sessions of my life involved trying to learn to sing and/or play a part, which I no longer do, unfortunately.

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2018/12/19/i-am-not.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-12-19 17:49:53 -0400">Dec 19, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>If Elon Musk&rsquo;s Boring Company can somehow <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/elon-musk-unveils-travels-boring-142500567.html">bring down the costs of digging tunnels</a>, that would be fantastic. However, I am skeptical (emphasis is mine):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Tuesday, Musk put the total price tag for the finished segment at about $10 million, including the cost of excavation, internal infrastructure, lighting, ventilation, safety systems, communications and a track.</p>

<p>By comparison, he said, digging a mile of tunnel by &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; engineering methods costs up to $1 billion and takes three to six months to complete. Musk boasted of several cost-cutting innovations, including higher-power boring machines, digging narrower tunnels, speeding up dirt removal, and simultaneous excavation and reinforcement.</p>

<p><strong>However, the process he describes is how modern tunnel boring machines work. And he rented his Canadian-built boring machine from a Wisconsin tunneling company.</strong> He&rsquo;s using the Wisconsin company, Super Excavators, as consultants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is Musk just selling a wish and a dream here? I really hope not. I share his dream of solving traffic problems with underground mass-transit and personal-transit systems. We need more tunnels to route traffic away from (or at least beneath) city centers, and to open additional arteries into cities like New York City that are largely surrounded by, or bordered by, water.</p>

<p>I lived through all the cost overruns in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig">The Big Dig</a> in Boston. There were major deficiencies in planning, lots of cutting corners in terms of materials, design, and engineering that came back to bite them, and simple graft and stupidity at play. I am not sure that The Boring Company can really put a huge dent into all those things. A lot of them are <em>not</em>  technical problems that engineers can solve.</p>

<p>The Big Dig was a huge mess that was on our minds in Boston for years. The end result of that mess of a project, though, was a much nicer and more cohesive downtown Boston. This came about mostly by reclaiming land that had been used for highway overpasses, not because traffic and commute times were substantially reduced.</p>

<p>I think that if Elon Musk and his Boring Company could somehow decrease the costs fo building tunnels, it would be far more important than building <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop">a new, sci-fi method of transportation</a>. I just don&rsquo;t think that he is actually doing it, even though he is telling everyone he is.</p>

         	<p>I never knew that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/obituaries/evelyn-berezin-dead.html">Evelyn Berezin, who died on Saturday, invented the word processor</a>, but I am certainly in her debt and grateful that she did.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In an age when computers were in their infancy and few women were involved in their development, Ms. Berezin (pronounced BEAR-a-zen) not only designed the first true word processor; in 1969, she was also a founder and the president of the Redactron Corporation, a tech start-up on Long Island that was the first company exclusively engaged in manufacturing and selling the revolutionary machines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suspect that sexism is the primary reason that her name was largely forgotten.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although Ms. Berezin was inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in Los Angeles in 2011, Matthew G. Kirschenbaum noted in “Track Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing” (2016), “she remains a relatively unknown and underappreciated figure, with nowhere near the stature of other women who played significant roles in computer science and the computer industry and have since been recognized by historians.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It probably did not help that her company&rsquo;s primary product was called the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102728582">Data Secretary</a>, which sounds incredibly antiquated now. (When was the last time we used the term secretary in the office to denote an &ldquo;administrative assistant”?)</p>

<p>If my daughter gets interested in computer science when she is older, I will definitely tell her about Evelyn Berezin in addition to the far more famous <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/adalovelace/">Ada Lovelace</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Plugins and Jails backend has switched from warden to iocage and warden will no longer receive bug fixes. The new UI will automatically use iocage to create and manage Plugins and Jails. Users are encouraged to recreate any existing Plugins and Jails using the new UI to ensure that they are running the latest supported application versions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have one FreeBSD jail on my server with lots of customized software on it (most notably, a custom build of <a href="https://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a> <em>and</em> two standard FreeNAS plugins. It has run rock solid for 2-3 years, but I can&rsquo;t update it for various technical reasons, the underlying OS software is out of date, and rebuilding it will be a pain in the neck. I should probably wait until I can set aside a few hours, completely uninterrupted, to work on an upgrade—which probably won&rsquo;t happen until sometime in January. Part of my wants to just let it run, updated, until the server dies—even if the software is very out of date—because it is behind a firewall and is largely shielded from cyberattack. I just never have been able to live like that before.</p>

(<a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/electrocardiogram-app-and-irregular-heart-rhythm-notifications-available-today/">The update enabling it just came out yesterday.</a>) It worked just like in Apple&rsquo;s demo—pretty cool! I wonder how useful it is for me, or if I should set a reminder to do one periodically. My guess is that it is merely &ldquo;for entertainment purposes only&rdquo; for me at least (I don&rsquo;t have A-fib), but I will ask my cardiologist to make sure.</p>

         	<p>I&rsquo;m not a <em>huge</em> Billy Joel fan, though I do have all his albums and respect him as an artist. I wish he had written another album after <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/river-of-dreams/158619540">River of Dreams</a></em>, which I am listening to again today. I think that, as a maker of <em>albums</em>, rather than singles, he hit his stride with <em>Storm Front</em> and that, <em>as an album</em>, <em>River of Dreams</em> is his best. His earlier albums have higher highs and lower lows, and don&rsquo;t hold together as well, in my opinion. I prefer picking through his excellent <em>Greatest Hits</em> collections rather than revisit the albums the songs come from.</p>

         	<p>One of my simple kitchen techniques to spruce up skinless, boneless chicken breasts is to throw a can of beans (cannellini or garbanzo) and some chicken broth on them, after searing the first side. I then cover them and simmer the chicken (typically in the oven) until it is done. I usually throw in some flour at the end, after taking the chicken out, to make a thick and creamy sauce.</p>

         	<p>I have just about every accessory I would imagine I would need for my (still) new Olympus OM-D EM10 Mark III camera, and all of them, except for the little carrying case it came with and my AmazonBasics tripod, fit into this little box. I never expected to buy so many lenses in such a short time (over a 4-month period). I was having so much fun shooting photos and expanding my camera&rsquo;s versatility. I tracked lens prices closely for months and bought each lens on a price dip; all in all I saved hundreds of dollars, compared to what it would have cost if I bought everything up front. Still, I spent way too much money this year on the camera; but at least I&rsquo;m almost done.</p>

<p>To keep everything neat and tidy, rather than lumped together in a little box, I think want some kind of padded, hardshell case for everything (such as a Pelican case). I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s worth the expense, though, because I don&rsquo;t think I would ever take it out of the house. I would continue to use the little case that came with the camera, which I love for its small size. It easily fits the camera and an extra lens or an external flash unit.</p>

<p>Once I sort the case situation out, I will be done with camera spending&hellip;at least for a few years.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2018/11/29/kodex-an-ios.html">Kodex: An iOS code/text editor I just discovered</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2018/11/29/kodex-an-ios.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-11-29 22:22:24 -0400">Nov 29, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I just discovered a versatile code (and text) editor for iOS called <a href="https://kodex.app">Kodex</a>. It is a free app with some pretty cool features:</p>

<ul>
<li>tight integration with the Files app</li>
<li>syntax highlighting for numerous languages (including Markdown)</li>
<li>multiple tabbed interface</li>
<li>a large assortment of hardware keyboard shortcuts, which you can customize the key bindings for</li>
<li>multiple cursor support (it&rsquo;s more rudimentary than Sublime Text&rsquo;s, which works with &ldquo;next word&rdquo; selection and the mouse, but it&rsquo;s a desktop-only app)</li>
<li>find/replace</li>
<li>find/replace with regEx</li>
<li>document minimap</li>
<li>a large assortment of themes and color schemes</li>
</ul>

<p>As nice as iOS is for text editing, especially if you have a hardware keyboard, it is hard to not see just how rudimentary most of its text editors are. There certainly is nothing like BBEdit or Sublime Text available on the platform (though Kodex is definitely aiming at Sublime Text, in its functionality).</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t even think of any iOS text editor, other than Kodex (which I just discovered), that supports working with documents in multiple tabs.  (Apple should really just make a Safari-like tab bar controller a standard component. I know I would use it in my apps.) Even features that are common on the desktop, like find and replace, have only become common on iOS in the past year or so.</p>

<p>The best text editors on the platform (such as Drafts) are made with MarkDown and automation in mind, which is cool. But they are simplistic compared to what is available on the desktop. I would love it if something as fast and versatile as Sublime Text was released on iOS. I would probably pay a lot of money for it, too.</p>

I am stuck, though, trying to figure out what text (and Markdown) editor I can use on iOS that will be acceptable to me. Pretext crashes on long files, but is otherwise OK. 1Writer is OK, but had trouble opening some of my files, and I don&rsquo;t like its floating buttons. There are so many decent Dropbox-enabled text editors on iOS, but very few that integrate well with the Files app.</p>

         	<p>Most of my cooking and cleaning plans today were derailed when my kitchen sink detached from the granite countertop. I was soaking oven racks in scalding hot water, which I do every year around this time, but this time the weight and the heat were too much. The sink’s seaI failed, and the sink dropped about an inch on one side. I had to bail gallons of hot water out with a bowl. Luckily, I was able to get it repaired about an hour later, but I can’t use the sink again until sometime tomorrow. At least this didn’t happen to me on Thanksgiving!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><h2>Files integration</h2>In late August I released a version of SwiftoDo that added sync support for any cloud data provider, via integration with the Files app. I think that this integration can be improved in the future. For example, right now, you cannot <em>create</em> a todo.txt file in the Files app using SwiftoDo, and you cannot open an existing todo.txt <em>from</em> the Files app.</p>

<p>If I add those features, I may as well rewrite the app’s UI, so that you have to create or open a file upon SwiftoDo’s launch. I would also have to rewrite how preferences are stored, so users could define different preferences for different files they open.</p>

<p>Those changes would, I think, necessitate dropping the offline support features that currently exist—namely manual sync mode, and the failsafes in place for when automatic sync fails (typically due to network unavailability). I am actually not sure how other document-based apps on iOS handle things when network connectivity is lost or unavailable. I would assume they simply cannot work without a constant network connection, because they cannot access their file, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>I do know that a task list is not a typical document-based app, like a text editor. Users typically want it to be always available, rather than dependent on a constantly-available network connection. Because I would rather not remove offline features from my app, and because I currently have very little time for app development, I do not plan any big changes to the app related to Files integration in the near future. When they do happen, I would expect that the UI of the app would be changed pretty significantly.
<h2>iOS 12 Support for SwiftoDo</h2>The current version of SwiftoDo runs on iOS 12 without incident. I have, however, compiled a new version of SwiftoDo on the iOS 12 SDK. It has no new features, but the SDK is newer, so it inherits upstream bug fixes from Apple, and I updated my codebase to Swift 4.2. I am dropping support for iOS 10.x, too, because iOS 12 will be released imminently, and it honestly makes no sense for anyone with an iOS device from the past four years or so not to upgrade to it (iOS 12 performance is that good). Because of the under-the-hood changes, and the dropped compatibility with iOS 10, I am bumping the version number to 3.0.0. (Don’t get too excited!)
<h2>macOS Mojave Support for SwiftoDo Desktop</h2>I am running the MacOS Mojave beta, and have been testing out its new dark mode. I love dark mode, and it took me about two seconds to realize that dark mode support is not a nice-to-have—it is an absolute necessity. Therefore, have coded support for it in a new build of SwiftoDo Desktop. I will submit it to the App Store soon.</p>

<p>The next version of SwiftoDo Desktop will be compiled on the macOS 10.4 SDK, and will no longer support macOS versions lower than that. (If you are not going to upgrade to Mojave, you can continue to use the version of SwiftDo Desktop you are currently using, of course.)</p>

<p>Other than dark mode support, there are no new features. (Sorry!) Because of the under-the-hood changes, and the change in minimum system requirements, I am bumping the version number to 3.0.0, though. (Again, don’t get too excited, but be happy your app is being supported.)
<h2>The future of SwiftoDo Desktop</h2>It is a weird coincidence that SwiftoDo and SwiftoDo Desktop will be on the same version number for a while, but it is only a coincidence. At present, they do not share any underlying code.</p>

<p>My long term plan is for SwiftoDo to resemble, and share tons of code with, the iPad version of SwiftoDo. The approach I would prefer to take would be to use the joint iOS/macOS framework that Apple said is coming next year. I will probably continue work on improving the iOS version’s codebase in preparation for eventual macOS support as well.</p>

<p>I am not sure if every user will want the iOS version on the desktop, but I know that <em>I</em> would. I have considered releasing the next-generation version, whenever it is ready, under a new name (SwiftoDo Desktop 2, maybe) and SKU, so owners of the current SwiftoDo Desktop could continue to use it until it no longer functions on macOS. I have not decided exactly what I will do just yet.</p>

<p>I do not expect that anyone outside Apple will learn anything about Apple’s new framework until WWDC 2019, which will be held in June. What I learn at that time will have significant impact on the direction in which I take SwiftoDo Desktop.</p>

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2018/08/17/altec-lansing-m.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-08-17 23:00:00 -0400">Aug 17, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>After enjoying the Philips Revolution speaker dock for a while, I started to look for a better sounding iPod dock. I found that in the Altec Lansing M650, which is a 2.1 channel system (yes, stereo speakers plus a tiny, down-firing subwoofer!) in a compact, triangular case, with a 30-pin iPod/iPhone dock on a ledge in front.</p>

<p>I thought, and still think, that it sounds great. Its sound is warm, rich, and natural. While I wouldn’t consider the bass response to be very tight, or there to be any stereo separation at all, it does sound really nice, and can fill a small bedroom or a home office with a pleasant sound that I could listen to for hours on end.</p>

<p>I used one as my main desktop stereo system for a couple years while I worked from home. It replaced my Harmon Kardon Soundsticks, which sounded better for music, but were not as easy to connect to my iPhone. It sounds great for music, podcasts, and for TV—thanks to its line-in jack, I often plugged an iPad into it for better audio when watching baseball or Netflix. I liked this speaker so much that I bought another one for the kitchen, where it was a great base station for phone charging and playing internet radio for several years.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while this speaker sounds great, its 30-pin dock is poorly implemented. After several months, both speakers emit annoying static from the 30-pin connector unless the iPhone is seated just right. I think I’m the only one in my house who knows how to fiddle with it until the sound clears up. Plus, of course, the 30-pin connector was made obsolete by Apple’s change to the Lightning standard.</p>

<p>I still use both of my M650s in my children’s rooms to play white noise while they sleep, and occasional music while they are awake, through our old iPhone 4 and 4S. It has gotten increasingly difficult to seat an iPhone on them without getting static through the 30-pin connection, but it is still possible. However, because the 30-pin iPhones that drive them are old and barely work at this point (software-wise), these speakers’ days as iPhone docks are numbered. They have a line-in jack in the back, however, and are prime candidates to pair with an Amazon Echo Dot (or something similar) sometime in the future.</p>

         	<p>The iPod had a monumental impact on how people listened to music. Not only did it turn people onto digital music downloads, rather than CDs, better than any preceding product; it also made listening to playlists and to shuffled music simple and extremely popular. The iPod’s 30-pin connector had a huge impact on home speaker systems as well. Suddenly, it became the default connection option for a bevy of home speakers. In stores, many speaker systems were repealed by iPod speaker docks.</p>

<p>While I had iPods since the first iPod Mini was released, shortly after I got married, I got an iPod Touch. It came for for free with my wife’s first MacBook Pro, and she had no interest in it. Of course, as a non-iPhone-owner, I found the iPod Touch to be an incredible upgrade from my iPod Nano. Around the same time, I got my first iPod speaker dock for free as well, in exchange for writing a review. It was a Philips Revolution speaker dock that looked somewhat like a boombox, could be driven by a bunch of D-cells or a power cord, and had a rotating dock that could accommodate (in portrait or in landscape mode) every iPod created to date and the first generation iPhone.</p>

<p>For sound, it was perfectly adequate. I liked it a lot at the time, but I thought of it like a boombox rather than a room-filling speaker system. It lacked a subwoofer, and thus had lackluster bass, but it was small, battery powered, and brought music into places in our apartment that it previously didn’t reach. My wife and I enjoyed using it with the iPod Touch for streaming music—mainly Pandora or streaming radio from WNYC—in the dining room while we ate dinner. I really enjoyed using it for background music during meals or for news radio, for which having the richest and best audio quality was not terribly important.</p>

<p>In the same way that my computer, once I got a CD-ROM drive, supplanted the stereo system as my main music player, this speaker system solidified the iPod’s (and later the iPhone’s) prime position as <em>the</em> source for music in my house. It also got me into the habit of <em>streaming</em> audio into the house, rather than only playing previously downloaded (or ripped) music. My wife and I used it in our kitchen for years to stream WNYC news and music. When the iPhone changed from the 30-pin connector to the Lightning connector however, this speaker dock’s days were numbered. And when that original iPod Touch’s software support was dropped by Apple, this speaker dock’s days were done.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In my mid 20s, I decided to move from boring (but nice) suburban Connecticut back to the Boston area where I went to college. It was a chance to reinvent myself, which is something I really needed to do at the time.</p>

<p>In the process, I replaced a lot of my belongings—cheap things or hand-me-downs that I had since my college days—with newer, better versions. I replaced nearly everything I cooked with and ate with: dishes, pots and pans, and small appliances. I bought a new wardrobe and got rid of my ratty old T-shirts and jeans. I traded up from a slow and struggling Dell tower PC to a sleek, fast, white MacBook (my first Mac!). I also traded up from my old, busted Altec Lansing computer speakers to the cool, futuristic Harman Kardon Soundsticks II that I saw in the Apple Store.</p>

<p>The Soundsticks’ clear plastic construction made them almost invisible. Their clear, light-up subwoofer looked like a bioluminescent jellyfish floating atop the tangle of wires under my desk. Their capacitive touch volume control was futuristic, too, but really hard to control; I mainly relied on my MacBook’s volume control instead.</p>

<p>In my cool, urban apartment, I played music through these cool, stylish speakers for hours and hours each day as I worked on my new MacBook (and on my work laptop, side-by-side). They sounded much better than my prior Altec Lansing computer speakers, but mostly they just looked better. I found that, at loud volumes, they didn’t really fill the room how I would have liked them, but I rarely played them that loud anyway, considering they were sitting on the desk I was working at.</p>

<p>During this time, I stopped buying CDs and started buying music online. I got into indie rock very heavily, mainly because I could get their tracks at great prices (25 cents per track) though eMusic. I first heard Okkervil River, Spoon, The Avett Brothers, The Apples in Stereo, Bright Eyes, Rilo Kily, Rainer Maria, and many, many other artists through these speakers.</p>

<p>I happily used these speakers for five years or so—even after moving from my hip, urban apartment to the suburban house I live in now—but I eventually tired of the mess their wires made atop and beneath my desk, and moved them into basement storage. Someday I hope to find another use for them, perhaps as a bookshelf system driven by a Raspberry Pi, but I would need to figure out a way to hide all the wires, so the great looks of these speakers shine through.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Over winter break, during my sophomore year in college, I bought my first <em>new</em> computer: a beige Dell tower with an Intel 486 processor. When pricing out systems—and this was done over the phone back then, rather than over the internet, because my parents did not have internet access in 1997—I configured nearly identical systems from Gateway and Dell at the same price. The only difference between them was in the peripherals: the Gateway came with a 19-inch monitor, rather than a 17-inch monitor, and the Dell came with a USB-connected, 2.1 channel Altec Lansing speaker setup. I bought the Dell, to get the better speakers.</p>

<p>At the time, I thought the trade-off was completely worth it. The speakers were tiny, stylish, had some fancy USB connectivity (USB was brand new then!), and came with a subwoofer, which I had never had before. The subwoofer added a new dimension to my music that I had never experienced before. It could shake the room if I wanted that, or just add some sub-bass dimension to the music. Its presence inspired me to pair this speaker set with my old, 2-channel Altec Lansing computer speakers, to create a 4.1 channel setup that I used to watch DVDs in my dorm room in 1999 and 2000. I had to upgrade my sound card to a Sound Blaster Audigy to get that to work. (I think that is the last dedicated sound card I ever bought!)</p>

<p>Their USB connection was not all I had hoped for, however. It did not carry the audio signal; it only allowed you to control the volume and EQ from a Windows menu bar application. It was pretty sophisticated for the time, but it was superfluous, and, I discovered after a year or so, the drivers that made it work caused Windows to crash all the time. So I disabled the USB feature and continued to use them for about 10 years, through college, grad school, and beyond. Eventually they wore out so badly they could no longer play at a proper volume. By that point, though, I had moved onto using an iPod for most of my music playback.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I got my first computer when I was in seventh grade. It was an IBM AT/XT that we upgraded several times over the years. By the time I was in high school, my dad bought me a SoundBlaster sound card and some 6-inch computer speakers. I actually do not remember who made them: it was either JBL, Creative, or Altec Lansing. What I do remember is that they were the generic beige color of all PC hardware of the era, the right speaker had knobs for balance and volume, and, as a pair, they could go very, very loud. No one else I came across had computer speakers that large or that loud.</p>

<p>Sound quality-wise, however, they were not great. Back then, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was still rare to hear any sounds at all coming out of a computer. It was enough to be able to hear the beeps and blips coming from my DOS-based productivity software and games.</p>

<p>Due to lackluster sound quality, and the fact that CD-ROM drives were too expensive for me to buy until the mid 1990s, these computer speakers never replaced my CD system’s speakers as my main playback system. They are important to me, however, because they enabled me, for the first time, to use the computer to record and mix music.</p>

         	<p>A week before I left for college I bought a Sony boombox to use as a bookshelf stereo. It had detachable speakers, so you could actually achieve stereo separation, and, of course, “mega bass”, which was pretty much mandatory for good sound in such small speakers.</p>

<p>I chose this particular model because it had an analog 3-band equalizer, as opposed to several genre-specific settings; I relied on the EQ to pick out guitar and bass parts I would transcribe. As a bonus, it didn’t have a crazy light show like the many of the other boomboxes on sale in 1996.</p>

<p>I don’t remember very well how it sounded, to be honest, because I wasn’t able to use it that much. My freshman year roommate and I did not share musical tastes, so I had to play my music through my computer using headphones. (My computer’s CD-ROM drive actually had a dedicated “play” button and its own headphone jack.) I didn’t realize it at the time, but all those hours listening to music over headphones (the cheapest headphones possible, I’d say) in my dorm room were the very beginning of my headphone-centric music listening preferences.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>My parents bought me my first CD player at the JC Penney Outlet. It was a damaged, open-box, no-name system that resembled a single, tall unit. It contained, from top to bottom, a turntable (though the clear cover was broken off and missing), an AM/FM radio, a five band equalizer, a dual deck cassette, and a single cd player at the bottom. The only reason I asked for it, and thought my family could afford it, was because it was damaged and was being sold at a steep discount. I also told my parents I would listen to classical music on it, which was my intent, but didn’t actually happen too often.</p>

<p>It came with two bookshelf speakers with RCA inputs that plugged in the rear, that I set up about ten feet away from the receiver. I couldn’t tell you how good or bad the sound was. All I knew at the time is that it was amazing compared to what I had at the time: my mom’s 20-year-old transistor radio, and a cheap, toy-like boombox with a dual cassette deck. The most important upgrade, of course, was upgrading from records and tapes to CDs. CDs didn’t have tape hiss, had high dynamic range, and didn’t wear out over time or get eaten by the plater sometimes.</p>

<p>I blasted music through this no-name system for hundreds of hours through middle school and high school. I measured my school papers by how many album listens it took to write them. I used it to practice singing, to transcribe songs with my guitar, to play back 4-track recordings, to lie back on my bed with CD liner notes while my favorite new song played on repeat.</p>

<p>I amassed an enormous CD collection, mostly through the Columbia House and BMG Music clubs, and partly through weekly trips to my local record store (which is long gone now).</p>

<p>Now that I’m a parent, I am amazed that all my loud music playing didn’t drive my parents crazy. They never complained to me about my music blasting from 3 PM to 10 PM every day. My kids are too little to listen to music on their own, but I’m already thinking about which headphones to get them, so we can all coexist in the house.</p>

<p>I have no idea where this system went or who made it, but, based on it being my first CD player, it is probably the most important speaker system I have ever owned.</p>

         	<p>I love music, and I love headphones, but, oddly enough, I have no special love for speakers. The reason, I suppose, is that, since I was a broke teenager living with my parents, I have never had the opportunity to listen to loud, room-filling music at my home. Roommates, sleeping children, and close neighbors have always prevented it. That said, my love of music has always depended on speakers, and, as I got older, they got a little better over the years.</p>

<p>I’m going to publish a short series of posts about the various speaker systems I’ve had over the years. After that, I will post a short series of posts about all the headphones I’ve had, and loved, over the years, as well.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I took a break from SwiftoDo development to build a new app, <a href="https://simplecallblockerapp.com">Simple Call Blocker</a>, which I <a href="https://mjdescy.me/2018/07/25/introducing-simple-call-blocker/">posted about</a> earlier this week. Building it was a fun diversion, and I learned a lot in the process, too. If you’re reading this, you’re probably wondering what’s up with SwiftoDo, however. I have been working on it this summer, too.</p>

<p>Since this spring, I have been promising everyone that I’m working on iOS 11+ Files app integration. This feature will let SwiftoDo open files from any cloud service provider that ties into the iOS 11+ Files app. That includes Dropbox, Box, NextCloud, OneDrive, Google Drive, and many others. Adding additional data providers to SwiftoDo has been a long time coming.</p>

<h2>Some background on SwiftoDo data providers</h2>

<p>I designed SwiftoDo data providers to be plugins that could be swapped out, which would allow me to support numerous cloud storage providers. I have had so much trouble getting the Dropbox data provider to be solid and stable, however, that I was loath to create more data providers. My thinking was that I was liable to cause more problems for my users (and myself!) than I would solve. Therefore, I concentrated on fixing up the Dropbox data provider code, which is now, after three or four rewrites, pretty solid.</p>

<p>(The Dropbox data provider code has always <em>worked</em>, but it had a rare but nasty crashing bug for some time, and some issues related to stability, ability to handle spotty network connections, and ability to handle, <em>gracefully</em>, Dropbox “rate limit exceeded” API responses.)</p>

<p>iOS 11’s Files app, which I did not anticipate being available when I first wrote SwiftoDo, obviates the need for additional “native” data providers. I just wasn’t sure if SwiftoDo would be able to tie into it.</p>

<h2>Can Files integration be used for SwiftoDo?</h2>

<p>I have been under the impression that integrating with the Files app would require a rewrite of major sections of the app, or would simply not work well due to sandboxing limitations. I thought this because all Files-based iOS apps that I have used follow Apple’s “Document-based app” template very closely: Think “Microsoft Word” rather than “Reminders” in terms of user interaction patterns. They open to a file browser, you open a document (typically a single document), work on the document, save it (automatically), and close the app. The life cycle of a document is fairly limited: after the app is killed, your file is closed and does not reopen on load. Most of these apps don’t work offline at all, unless you’re working with local-only files, because they can’t open your file.</p>

<p>In contrast, SwiftoDo works a lot differently. It manages your task list locally and syncs it to an external file. It lets you archive completed tasks to a second external file. It keeps the opening and choosing of files down to a minimum. Most users set up their todo.txt and archive files once and never touch those settings again. It lets you work offline (primarily in “manual sync mode”, but also when the network is unavailable) and sync your changes to the cloud on demand.</p>

<p>Integrating SwiftoDo with the Files app, without giving up anything, seemed like it might be a considerable challenge.</p>

<h2>A “Files” data provider</h2>

<p>To my surprise, implementing a “Files” data provider has not been as challenging as I thought it would be. Accessing documents via the iOS document picker and restoring them after the app is killed, via secure bookmarks, is actually pretty easy. It took me only a couple hours to set up a data provider that would upload and download to iCloud Drive and even Dropbox through the Files app.</p>

<p>That is not nearly enough to ship the feature, though. There are still some issues regarding stability and error handling that I have to work through.</p>

<p>Adding this feature also prompted me to display file names in Settings (rather than 2 screens deep in Settings) and atop the task list in the main view.</p>

<h2>What is next?</h2>

<p>After I finish the Files data provider work, and the new Xcode and iOS versions are officially released, I plan to build SwiftoDo on the iOS 12 SDK and drop iOS 10 support. I’ve been thinking of bumping the version number to 3.0 at that point, to mark the change in iOS compatibility.</p>

<p>I will also consider the future of Files integration in SwiftoDo. It temping for me to remove the entire “data provider” layer and just make SwiftoDo a normal iOS document-based app. That would be a big deal, and I would not make that change unless I understood fully what that would mean for users. I also have to consider how long I will continue to support the existing Dropbox data provider, as it will be somewhat redundant.</p>

<p>After that, I will have the opportunity to simplify the codebase quite a bit. It is tempting for me to rewrite some or all of the UI layer, to incorporate the new techniques I have learned since coding version 2, over a year ago. Any changes to the UI code will probably be related to new features or a minor redesign of the sorting/filtering interface that I have been thinking about.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Recently I released a new iOS app: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-call-blocker/id1409872025?ls=1&amp;mt=8" title="Available on the App Store">Simple Call Blocker</a>.</p>

<p>It is a <em>free</em> utility that lets you block unwanted calls to your iPhone. Unlike most of the call blockers on iOS, it allows you to block whole ranges of numbers, such as your phone number’s extension, <em>for free</em>. You may also <em>whitelist</em> numbers, ranges of numbers, or all your contacts’ phone numbers, so that they will not be blocked by this app, even if they are in the blacklist.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://simplecallblockerapp.com">Simple Call Blocker website</a> explains it in more detail.</p>

<h2>Why did I write it?</h2>

<p>I wanted to write a small, relatively simple app that would allow me to explore the following things:</p>

<ol>
    <li>iOS application architecture: I have been reading books and articles on iOS application architecture, and decided to create a new app to practice new techniques, such as the use of coordinators for navigation rather than storyboard segues, that I have been learning.</li>
    <li>algorithms and operation queues: I started the app by writing some simple algorithms for creating sequential phone number ranges to load into an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/callkit">iOS CallKit directory extension</a>. The last thing I wrote was a multi-threaded operation queue for processing blacklist and whitelist rules and refreshing the iOS call directory extension that actually blocks the phone numbers.</li>
    <li>Core Data: I avoided learning Core Data for years; that changed with this app.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, the app was a lot of fun to write. It took me about a month in my after-hours “free time” to create. The overall process has made me a better iOS app developer. I’m excited to bring forward the skills and concepts I developed on this project to future work.</p>

<h2>Why a call blocker app?</h2>

<p>I started getting <a href="https://www.bbb.org/en/us/article/news-releases/16670-a-new-kind-of-phone-scam-neighbor-spoofing">neighbor spam calls</a>, so I downloaded nearly all the iOS call blocking apps I could find. There were fewer such apps than I thought there would be, all of them seemed amateurish in some way or another, and all of them (as of a month ago) required an in-app purchase or a subscription to block my neighborhood exchange. I wasn’t willing to pay for that feature in any of the apps that I tried, because all of those apps weren’t that good. Plus, blocking an exchange, or a continuous range of numbers, is pretty trivial, so I thought I could create an app that did that, and offer it for free to people.</p>

<h2>So is this just a “practice” app?</h2>

<p>No. It is well-written and works as well as iOS’s Call Directory extensions allow it to. It has a rough edge or two, though, in that it reloads its directory extension and reports success or errors back to the users, rather than trying to prevent the user from ever encountering an error from being reported by the directory extension loading process.</p>

<p>What that means is that you <em>can</em> ask Simple Call Blocker to block more numbers that iOS will allow—there is an undocumented limit—and the app has to wait for the CallKit Directory Extension’s load process to report success or failure before it can tell the user what is going on. I decided not to try to impose limits on how many numbers could be blacklisted, but instead allow the app to report the Directory Extension’s errors, if any, back to the user. I figure that the undocumented maximum number of blocked phone numbers probably is dependent on whatever hardware is in your phone, and probably is increasing in every new iPhone model.</p>

<p>The Simple Call Blocker directory extension is coded extremely conservatively, and it optimized for very low RAM and system usage. If iOS cannot load it, it is because the user put too many numbers in the blacklist, or because it is still loading numbers from a prior attempt.</p>

<p>Releasing the app for free, I think, makes it OK that it may not work exactly as users expect it to.</p>

<h2>What is the future of this app?</h2>

<p>I plan to support it through various iOS releases, but otherwise not improve it too much. After all, it is a free app.</p>

<h2>I want to know more!</h2>

<p>Go ahead and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-call-blocker/id1409872025?ls=1&amp;mt=8">download the app in the iOS App Store</a> (it’s free!), and check out the <a href="https://simplecallblockerapp.com">FAQ</a> online.</p>

         	<p>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17561768/dont-feed-the-trolls-online-harassment-abuse">DON’T FEED THE TROLLS, AND OTHER HIDEOUS LIES</a>&rdquo; is a great article by &ldquo;Film Crit Hulk&rdquo; on our collective failure to respond properly to internet trolling culture.</p>

<blockquote>
A Twitter follower reminded me of a line in the famous parable from Bion of Borysthenes: “Boys throw stones at frogs in fun, but the frogs do not die in fun, but in earnest.” Defenders of trolling insist it’s all just a joke, but if trolling is inherently designed to get a rise out of someone, then that’s what it really is. In many cases, it is designed to look and feel indistinguishable from a genuine attack. Whether you believe what you are saying or not is often immaterial because the impact is the same — and you are responsible for it, regardless of how funny you think it is.
</blockquote>

<p>I think that there is a fundamental misunderstanding of trolling. It isn&rsquo;t a joke. It isn&rsquo;t done <em>for the lulz</em>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a joke&rdquo; is an <em>obvious cover</em> for bad behavior.</p>

<p>It reminds me of an episode from my youth. In high school I had a friend who had a stash of <em>Playboy</em> magazines that he got (I think) from an older brother. Somehow we found out about them, demanded to see them, and teased him about them as we thumbed through them together. &ldquo;Why do you have these&rdquo; we would ask, teasingly, knowing full well why he had them. My friend&rsquo;s face would grow bright red and we would stammer: &ldquo;because they&rsquo;re so funny&rdquo;. When pressed, he would double down on it: he would swear, up and down, that he had them because they were <em>hilarious</em>. Sure they were.</p>

<p>It puzzles me, why we act as if it&rsquo;s even possible that verbal abuse on the internet is &ldquo;just a joke&rdquo;. A decent response to &ldquo;it was just a joke&rdquo; is &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
The biggest mistake we ever made with trolls was making the question of abuse about how to placate and fix them instead of how to empower the people they hurt or manage your own well-being in the face of them. Like so many abused people, we thought the solutions involved walking on eggshells and not provoking them back. But instead, we must acknowledge “that we are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about who we pretend to be.” And that means acknowledging the awful, terrifying power of jokes and the immunity we seek in “not being serious.” This is exactly why people troll in the first place. Because deep down, they know it’s serious, and that’s exactly why it makes them feel powerful.

By law, they might not be legally responsible for the content of their site, but they are ethically and morally responsible for it, regardless. Owning and running a site where terrible things happen should be a black mark on a company’s or a person’s reputation—and that should matter.</p>

<p>It would be nice if people started to care about reputation again, and if bad reputations led to lower profits and lower stature in the global community. Sadly, we are in a time, right now, where that does not seem to be the case.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I’m re-committing to <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>, after a year or more away from it. I’m happy with what I am doing now, and thought I would document it in case anyone else wanted help understanding how to use the Pinboard effectively, especially if their usage lapsed, as mine did.</p>

<h2>What is Pinboard?</h2>

<p>Pinboard is an “antisocial” cloud bookmarking service. You can keep all your bookmarks there and use its barebones website or third party apps and browser extensions, all using an open API, to access them. It’s a paid service, run by a single person, with a clear and straightforward business model. When I signed up, I pre-paid for ten years of service. Part of my impetus for using it again now, after having abandoned it for, well, nothing, is the sunk-cost fallacy. The other, more important part of that impetus is that I really like the simplicity and speed of Pinboard, and I like the Pinboard iOS client I use, <a href="http://pinnerapp.net">Pinner</a>.</p>

<h2>What do I use it for?</h2>

<p>I use it for three things:</p>

<ol>
    <li>To host my bookmarks in a cross-platform, always accessible way. I can get to the same bookmarks in Safari on my Mac and iOS, and in Chrome on Windows.</li>
    <li>For research and archival purposes, especially for programming projects I am working on. I can search these bookmarks on keywords, title, or description to review <em>the best</em> of the web pages I previously read on a topic of interest.</li>
    <li>As part of a homegrown “read it later” service. I can send article URLs to Pinboard from various apps, and read them later using Pinboard’s website, an app or browser extension on my Mac, and an app on iOS or Andriod.</li>
</ol>

<p>Number 3 used to be the <em>primary</em> purpose of Pinboard to me. I had signed up as part of an effort to get replace Pocket with something more privacy focused. After many years of using <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> (formerly “Read It Later”) to collect articles I was interested in from the huge stream of RSS feeds I parsed every day, I wanted a change. Primarily, this was because I became uncomfortable with Pocket’s business model: Why was it free? How did they really make money? What were they doing will all the data they collected on me?</p>

<p>I also wasn’t crazy about some of the UI changes made to Pocket over the years. I wanted more control over the reading experience, too, which is something that using a web service with an open API would give me. It helps that, at the time, <a href="https://www.imore.com/how-use-reader-view-safari-iphone-and-ipad">Safari’s Reader View</a> debuted, and I thought it was fantastic.</p>

<p>I was pretty obsessive about channeling all the articles I read through Pinboard, so I had a one-way workflow from discovery to reading to marking read. I never deleted anything from Pinboard, either. I thought I wanted a history of all the articles I ever read, in case I wanted to search through that history later. (Of course, I never did that.)</p>

<h2>Why did I stop using it?</h2>

<p>I stopped using Pinboard for three main reasons:</p>

<ol>
    <li>I started reading Twitter <em>more</em> than actual articles linked to from it. The constantly updating timeline was incredibly addictive, and less mentally taxing to follow than reading complex articles from actual publications. (I have since given up Twitter because it was <em>too</em> addictive for me to handle responsibly.)</li>
    <li>My wife and I had kids, meaning that I no longer had a bunch of downtime after dinner to catch up on all the articles I had bookmarked to read later. I would still send stuff to Pinboard to read later, but I would never actually read the articles.</li>
    <li>My wife and I subscribed to <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>The New York Times</em>, and <em>The Washington Post</em>. I started reading from those publications, from their apps, a lot more than scouring RSS feeds for articles from a dozen sources. Reading from their apps did not fit very well with my Pinboard workflow.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, Pinboard became a graveyard for links I didn’t actually want to read. Instead of a useful resource, it was a junk pile full of stale content.</p>

<h2>Digging out of a mess</h2>

<p>I took the following steps to return Pinboard to a useful utility for me:</p>

<ol>
    <li>I deleted <em>everything</em> I had in Pinboard—over 3,000 bookmarks that were doing me no good. Most of these were articles I imported from my RSS reader (Reeder) or Twitter (via Tweetbot), read once, and then just left in Pinboard.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>I installed <a href="https://aki-null.net/shiori/">Shiori</a> on my MacBook Pro. Shiori is a Pinboard bookmark launcher and editor. It's like <a href="https://qsapp.com">QuickSilver</a> for Pinboard—hidden until you need it, only a keypress away, and accessible from anywhere. I set it up so that Control+Option+Command+P brings up the bookmark search window (from anywhere), and Control+Option+Command+B brings up the bookmark editor.</li>
    <li>I set up <a href="http://pinnerapp.net">Pinner</a> on iOS. Pinner is a full-featured Pinboard client. It will open Pinboard bookmarks in Safari or within Pinner, via Safari View Controller. It has two app extensions for creating bookmarks. The first extension, “Quick Pin”, has no UI, and is for quickly adding bookmarks to read later. The second extension lets you edit, interactively, all the metadata associated with the bookmark prior to saving it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My workflow</h2>

<p>I developed a new workflow to work with Pinboard, so I don’t end up with a mess of useless bookmarks again. Honestly, though, calling it a <em>workflow</em> is an exaggeration. I basically decided to manage Pinboard with a simple set of rules.</p>

<p>I will continue to use Pinboard both for permanent bookmarks, which mostly involve specific technical documentation about Swift and iOS development, and for a read-it-later service, which are bookmarks I want to keep around temporarily, some of which I plan to keep long term.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Bookmarks I would keep in Safari, for sites I would log into (banking websites, personal websites, blogs, GitHub, BitBucket, etc.), are stored as private bookmarks with tags. All of these bookmarks are also tagged “Safari” so I can pull them all, as a group, with a Pinboard search.</li>
    <li>Bookmarks for articles to read later, and everything else, are saved with the “read later” flag set to “true”, primarily by using Pinner’s “Quick Pin” extension or the “send to Pinboard” command within <a href="http://reederapp.com/ios/">Reeder</a> (my RSS reader app of choice).</li>
    <li>I regularly use Pinner or Shiori to browse my “read later” list. Basically, I had to kick the Twitter habit.</li>
    <li>After I read articles marked “read later”, I delete the bookmark, or choose to save it. I am pretty ruthless about deleting bookmarks now, which is the opposite of how I used to be. If I don’t read something after a few days, I will just delete it.</li>
    <li>Rarely, I will choose to save the bookmark. If I do so, I edit the bookmark’s metadata to remove the “read later” flag and to add keywords and a description. I open copy the first paragraph of the article to the bookmark’s description field, so it’s clear to me later on why I saved it.</li>
</ol>

<p>So far this workflow has been working well for me. I collect “read later” bookmarks throughout the day, read through them in the evening, and delete almost all of them at the end of the day. My Pinboard bookmarks list is much smaller than before, but contains only good stuff that I want to act on, either now or later.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2018/06/11/a-hardware-keyboard.html">A Hardware Keyboard Shortcuts Tip for Drafts 5</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2018/06/11/a-hardware-keyboard.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-06-11 23:00:00 -0400">Jun 11, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a href="http://getdrafts.com">Drafts 5</a> is a great app for capturing thoughts, drafting notes, and capturing tasks, and quickly sending them, via <em>Actions</em>, to other apps or services for further processing. The typical workflow is:
<ol>
    <li>Launch Drafts</li>
    <li>Type a draft</li>
    <li>Launch an Action to process the draft</li>
</ol>On iPhone, swiping left from anywhere to pick an Action is right at your fingertips, since you are typing on screen. On iPad, if you type with an external keyboard (which I highly recommend), launching an Action is a little more cumbersome. By default, you have to move your fingers off the keyboard and reach up to the screen to get to your Actions list. There is another way to launch Actions, however, that doesn&rsquo;t require you to move your fingers off the keyboard.
<h2>Custom hardware keyboard shortcuts</h2>Drafts 5 lets you assign custom hardware keyboard shortcuts to any Action. This is an extremely rare, and extremely powerful, feature. You can configure hardware keyboard shortcuts for text formatting commands and to insert text snippets (such as today&rsquo;s date) into your draft. You can also define a set of hardware keyboard shortcuts to use to complete your drafts.</p>

<p>I use Drafts 5 throughout the day to write microblog posts, notes, and tasks and send them to where they need to go: Dropbox, Ulysses, my to-do app <a href="https://swiftodoapp.com">SwiftoDo</a>, and so on. For all my most-used Actions that process drafts, I use an easy-to-mash but hard to accidentally type accelerator, <code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>, plus one letter, when I complete my draft and want to send it on its way.</p>

<p>I use the <code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code> accelerator <em>only</em> for Actions that complete drafts, so it&rsquo;s always clear to me when I type it that I am ending my draft and sending it somewhere else.</p>

<p>Here is my list of hardware keyboard shortcuts, each of which I find incredibly useful:
<ul>
    <li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>D</code>: save draft to a Dropbox folder</li>
    <li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>U</code>: save draft to a Ulysses Inbox folder</li>
    <li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>T</code>: send tasks in draft to my todo.txt file via SwiftoDo</li>
    <li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>M</code>: post draft directly to Micro.blog</li>
    <li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>G</code>: search for draft text in Google</li>
    <li><code>Control</code>+<code>Option</code>+<code>Command</code>+<code>A</code>: search for draft text in App Store</li>
</ul>Each shortcut is easily mapped to its Action via the &ldquo;Edit Action&rdquo; dialog. (See the photo that accompanies this blog post.) If you forget what custom shortcuts you created, hold down <code>Command</code> while editing your draft, and all the custom shortcuts you defined will appear in the standard iOS hardware keyboard shortcut pop-up display.</p>

<p>These hardware keyboard shortcuts don&rsquo;t necessarily save me a <em>lot</em> of time and trouble, but they make my Drafts workflow on iOS feel fast and comfortable. I highly recommend setting some up for your own iPad Drafts workflow.</p>

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2018/06/06/what-would-make.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-06-06 23:00:00 -0400">Jun 6, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I love the Apple Watch. I didn&rsquo;t always, though. When I first tried on a Series 0, a couple weeks before it was released, I quickly made the decision not to buy one. I thought it was too expensive and that it was not immersive enough. I had been expecting an iPhone for the wrist; what it was instead was a wristwatch with some extras. Six months later, however, I relented and bought one, mostly because Target was offering the Space Gray Sport model at a deep discount, and I wanted to pick a holiday gift for myself that my family members could chip in for.</p>

<p>I quickly grew to love the Apple Watch, despite its slow speed and lack of viable third-party applications. The first-party Apple Watch applications alone—such as Messages, Workouts, and Weather—pleased me very much. Caller ID on my watch was great for avoiding telemarketing calls at dinner. Something as simple as having the temperature always available on my watch face far more useful than I had anticipated.</p>

<p>I have a Series 1 now because my Series 0&rsquo;s screen popped off due to battery swelling after almost two years. Apple covered it under an extended warranty and sent me a Series 1 for free. The Series 1 is much faster than the Series 0, and is not going to be obsoleted by Watch OS 5 in the fall. Still, it isn&rsquo;t as fast, and consequently as useful, as the Series 3. I fully expect a new Apple Watch model to be released later this year, which will be even faster.</p>

<p>If I still had the Series 0, I had planned to upgrade this year, for increased performance alone. Now that I have the Series 1, I am not so sure. My Series 1 has great battery life, but is starting to show performance problems. Workouts, for example, take a long time to start. Third party apps are still, largely, useless for me, for the same reason. Despite these problems, most of the features of the Apple Watch are still working just fine for me.</p>

<p>The main feature that would tempt me to upgrade, at this point, would be new or better health monitoring features. The idea that the watch could save my life, by monitoring for irregular heartbeats, is very compelling to me. I would welcome and pay for any additional features in that area. If they are confined to newer hardware, I would definitely upgrade to get them. I care more about that sort of thing than I do about increased speed, cellular or GPS connectivity, or (if the rumors are true) a larger display area.</p>

         	<h2>There’s more beauty in this world than you can guess</h2>

<p>Recently, with the help of someone on <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> and Apple Music, I have turned my family on to the music of Justin Roberts. His band plays children’s music in a power pop style. His music is really catchy, and his lyrics are wry, funny, very kid-friendly (my daughter sings them all the time), and sometimes also play to the parents on emotional level as well.</p>

<p>My favorite Justin Roberts song, by far, is “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNb5SPOYLCQ">Recess</a>”. Like the best power pop songs, this song has more hooks and ideas in it than most albums do. The lyrics are cleverly and consistently written from the point of view of a bored kid stuck in a classroom, waiting for the recess bell to ring:</p>

<blockquote>
Can’t you hear the blacktop callin’?
Classroom clock is stuck or stallin’
There is nothing that will pass the test 
Unless it’s recess
</blockquote>

<p>In the second and third pre-chorus endings, the lyrics expand out beyond the tedium of the elementary school classroom to the wonder of the outside world:</p>

<blockquote>
One more dotted I
One more crossed T 
Then we’ll be runnin’ free
There is more beauty in this world than you can guess
</blockquote>

<p>That last line resonates powerfully with me. Seeing the beauty in this world is something children do naturally. I think we forget how to, as we get older, and our knowledge of history and current events expands, and our experience of life evolves from dreaming of what our lives might be to actually living them day-to-day. Our dreams get smaller and more finite as time passes. As we get older still, we relearn to see the beauty, in a different way—with a wonder that is tinged with sadness. As an adult, I see that the splendor and joy of the world is counterbalanced by its disappointments and horrors.</p>

<h2>The world is at least fifty percent terrible, and that’s a conservative estimate, though I keep this from my children</h2>

<p>The line “There is more beauty in this world than you can guess” always makes me think of the contrasting sentiment expressed in the poem <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/89897/good-bones">“Good Bones” by Maggie Smith</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Good Bones
BY MAGGIE SMITH

Life is short, though I keep this from my children.
Life is short, and I’ve shortened mine
in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,
a thousand deliciously ill-advised ways
I’ll keep from my children. The world is at least
fifty percent terrible, and that’s a conservative
estimate, though I keep this from my children.
For every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.
For every loved child, a child broken, bagged,
sunk in a lake. Life is short and the world
is at least half terrible, and for every kind
stranger, there is one who would break you,
though I keep this from my children. I am trying
to sell them the world. Any decent realtor,
walking you through a real shithole, chirps on
about good bones: This place could be beautiful,
right? You could make this place beautiful.
</blockquote>

<p>This is a profoundly powerful poem that I read in college and have never forgotten. As an adult and a parent, I return to it often. It has always made me feel, in some way, like a teenager who concludes, upon first entering the adult world, that I have been sold a bill of goods: nothing is as nice or easy or fair as my parents and mentors (and, let’s face it, TV and movies) told me it would be. This poem distills all the disappointment and disillusionment that experience and maturity bring into seventeen simple and somewhat humorous lines. I love how it ends on a note that is somehow both cynical and hopeful: “You could make this place beautiful.”</p>

<h2>Selling the world to my children</h2>

<p>It’s my job, as a parent, to sell the world to my children. I want to tell them the good—now, while they are young—and the bad—later, when they are older. In both times, now and later, I have to remember that Justin Roberts and Maggie Smith are both right about the world. It contains all the beauty that has any meaning. It also contains all the horrors that have ever befell anyone. The most important thing I have to teach my children is that they can make it better—they just have to try, even after the veil of childhood innocence has fallen, and they see the world for what it really is.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>WWDC is in a little more than two weeks. As a hobbyist developer, I don’t go to big, expensive conferences 3,000 miles from my home. But I do eagerly await it each year. Last year I was so excited about it that I went as far as calling it “nerd Christmas”. This year, though, I’m <em>not</em> looking forward to the keynote, the new APIs, the betas, and so on.</p>

<p>There have been no substantive leaks about what will be announced, and no one’s predictions so far have been that compelling. That’s in stark contrast to last year, when I practically knew what iOS 11 would bring to the iPad, based on rumors and speculation. This year, the most exciting leak we got is that a cross-platform macOS/iOS development framework <em>will not</em> be announced this year.</p>

<p>As a user and a fan, I basically want Apple to announce a rebuilding year. iOS 12 should be a maintenance release. They can make their software faster and more stable. They can make Siri <em>a lot</em> better. They can fix bugs. Other than that, I don’t want a radical UI overhauls of any of their operating systems (as if the latter would ever happen). On the hardware side, I’d love to see them refresh the MacBook Pro and iPhone SE sometime this year, but my expectations for an announcement at WWDC are very low.</p>

<p>As a developer, I don’t really want to worry about having to support new frameworks or features. Just upgrading from one iOS framework to the next one can sometimes take days of work before all the kinks are worked out. Even upgrading Xcode to a new major version is, as a Swift developer at least, a little scary. New versions of Xcode have not been stable or bug-free for me since Xcode 8 was released. The recently released Xcode 9.3.1 has been working really well for me, though, and I’m loath to give it up anytime soon. I’d love WWDC to be about Apple fixing the numerous, relatively minor, UIKit bugs that I’ve had to work around, but past history leads me to believe that iOS 12 will just have another set of odd bugs to work around.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In programming, there has long been a warning in computer science to avoid <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization">premature optimization</a>. Donald Knuth called it “the root of all evil”. I find myself thinking about this all the time—not so much while programming, but when I’m thinking of spending money on myself, or telling people how to spend their money on me, as for birthday or Father’s Day gifts.</p>

<p>I’m at an age now where I have everything I would ever want. But…everything I have could still be a little bit better. To wit:</p>

<ul>
    <li>I have awesome headphones that I love. I want better ones. And different ones.</li>
    <li>I have a home server that is underpowered, but quiet and extremely reliable. I would love one with enough power to could run virtual machines, but I don’t really need it. </li>
    <li>I have a clicky mechanical keyboard that I love. I want a better one—that lights up, unnecessarily, or has colorful keycaps.</li>
    <li>I have an Apple wireless keyboard for my Mac. I want to replace it with the Apple Magic keyboard, even though I already have an Apple Magic keyboard for my iPad.</li>
    <li>I have a Series 1 Apple Watch that I love. I would love, even more, a Faster Series 3. </li>
    <li>Let’s not even talk about iPads and Macs.</li>
</ul>

<p>These few things are some of my material obsessions. What they have in common, for me, is that they have all been satisfied by things I already own, upgrading to newer or better versions would cost a lot of money (way more than anyone would spend in a gift for me), and the upgrade would be only marginally better than what I have, so I’m not sure if it would even make me happy.</p>

<p>Despite knowing all this, I can’t stop thinking about upgrading what I have to something better. I always want to <em>optimize</em> my experience with the things I enjoy. But, until the things I have break down and are no longer useful, it is <em>too early</em> to upgrade them. Doing so would be indulging in <em>premature optimization</em>, which be wasteful, which is “the root of all evil” to me.</p>

<p>Someday, my headphones will break, my keyboards won’t be compatible with my computers, my server won’t support the OS I want to run, and Apple won’t support my hardware anymore. That’s when I will upgrade these things—after I have extracted every bit of their value. Until then, I will just daydream about, and feel a little guilty about obsessing about, premature optimization.</p>

This is the third in a series of posts about my realization that I have become an audiophile. <a href="https://mjdescy.me/2018/03/10/my-slide-into-audiophile-territory-part-2/">The prior post</a> examined what it means to me to be an audiophile.
</blockquote>

<h2>It’s about spending money, right?</h2>

<p>Calling yourself an audiophile is a little like calling yourself a rube and not realizing it. That’s because being an audiophile is a hobby marked far more by spending large amounts of money on speakers (I include headphones here, of course)—speakers that sound only a tiny bit better than much less expensive speakers, than on anything else. At worst, it’s conspicuous consumption wrapped in a superiority complex, or an obsession that has gotten embarrassingly expensive. At best, however, it’s about finding new ways to enjoy the music you love, enjoying that music an awful lot with the equipment you have, while keeping a level head about your budget and equipment’s price-to-performance ratio.</p>

<p>I, of course, include myself in the latter camp. I’ve spent a good amount of money on headphones at this point, but I am mostly interested in extracting as much value out of them—as many listening hours and as much enjoyment as possible—rather than on what the next better set of headphones will be.</p>

<h2>But why spend a lot more money on a tiny improvement in sound quality?</h2>

<p>I care an awful lot about music. I’ve found, quite accidentally, that there is more detail to be heard in the recordings I love, provided I have better speakers or headphones to listen to them with.</p>

<p>I never thought I was missing anything when I listened to everything through $10 Sony earbuds that I would have to replace every three months or so. When I got my first pair of over-ear headphones, though, it opened a new world for me. I heard details in the music I had never noticed before. The soundstage sounded wider. Instruments sounded more distinct, realistic, and separate from each other than I had ever heard before. Drumbeats had a more visceral impact, due to headphone drivers being much larger than those I was used to. On a more basic level, the over-ear headphones had better isolation than the earbuds did, blocking out outside noise, allowing me hear my music even better. Listening to music, something I loved already, became more fun and more exciting than ever before.</p>

<p>Those first over-ear headphones, which I credit for opening my eyes to the benefits of higher-end gear, were nothing special. They were a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056VMBOG">SteelSeries 7H</a> gaming headset, which I received for free in exchange for writing a review. At the time, it was a $130 headset; today they are being sold for $21, proving that you don’t have to spend outrageous amounts of money to get better audio quality. I’m not saying they are the best headphone ever. Compared to Apple and Sony earbuds, though, they sound fantastic. I never would have realized it, if I hadn’t picked them up.</p>

<p>The headphones I’m wearing right now cost a lot more than those SteelSeries cans, and they reveal details in the music that the SteelSeries cannot. They are objectively better. But the much cheaper headphones are still <em>just fine</em>, and sound way better than whatever free pack-ins you got with your smartphone. I enjoyed them and would probably still be using them to this day if they had not broken. (Headphone durability is a separate issue from sound quality, and can be worth spending more money on.)</p>

<p>The jump from $10 headphones to $130 headphones was definitely worth it to me. Each jump up in price I have made since then was worth it, too. (I didn’t get <em>all</em> my headphones for free!) If I hadn’t tried headphones better than the ones I was used to, I never would have known that better sound was even possible.</p>

<h2>What about the law of diminishing marginal returns?</h2>

<p>After a certain dollar amount, each additional dollar spent on audio equipment buys you less and less of an improvement in quality. This is the law of diminishing marginal returns, and it’s a very real thing.</p>

<p>Audiophiles can spend stupid amounts of money on headphones and speakers. (To me, the “stupid” threshold is over $400; it may be way higher or  way lower to you.) Some headphones cost well over a thousand dollars. Still other models, designed, I think, for for people with more money than sense, retail for three thousand dollars or more. Some speakers cost tens of thousands of dollars. In addition, some people spend hundreds or thousands on receivers, amps, DACs, and whatever other signal processing they want to use to drive their headphones or speakers. The audiophile hobby can get extremely expensive, if you have the money and are never satisfied with what you have. It doesn’t have to be, though.</p>

<p>In my opinion, you have to stop spending money on audio equipment at some point. If you are never satisfied with what you have, the problem may be something other than not having spent enough to buy decent hardware. You can still be an audiophile without buying new equipment all the time or going broke (or merely being ripped off) on over-expensive gear. It’s about the love of the game—the love of music and the gear it plays on—not the love of spending or the fear of missing out on an even better thing.</p>

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2018/04/27/swiftodo-development-notes.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-04-27 23:00:00 -0400">Apr 27, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Weekly updates to <a href="https://swiftodoapp.com">SwiftoDo</a> came to an end in early April, but work on SwiftoDo has continued apace.</p>

<h2>What’s next?</h2>

<p>I am working on an update, version 2.12.0, that includes a couple minor, but long-requested features: (1) a setting to preserve priority on completed tasks and (2) a default priority setting for new tasks. Implementing these features required lots of behind-the-scenes effort. Consequently, neither could be completed in less than a week.</p>

<p>I am currently working on improving the Dropbox code that (1) checks whether SwiftoDo is authorized to access Dropbox, and (2) reports this to the user in a clear and actionable way. This is necessary because Dropbox can de-authorize SwiftoDo for various reasons, including when I upgrade the Dropbox library I am using, which is exactly what the version I am working on does. When this happens, SwiftoDo will alert the user after an upload or a download fails. Based on user reports, however, this notification doesn’t always happen, which can lead to data loss if the user does not realize you are working offline.</p>

<p>Once I finish my work on the Dropbox-related code, I can release this version.</p>

<h2>What’s after that?</h2>

<p>After I complete version 2.12.0, I plan to focus my efforts on implementing iOS 11 Files integration. Everything else, other than fixing critical bugs, will be put on hold.</p>

<p>The basic mechanics of Files integration are not hard, but they are not really meant for a to-do app—especially one that manages two files. I am unsure if it would require uses to re-open their todo.txt and archive files periodically, after the app is killed, or every time you wish to archive, which may be annoying to users. I am not yet sure how it will affect archiving, manual sync mode, and whether offline access would be possible.</p>

<p>In a best-case scenario, Files integration will eventually allow me to get rid of the Dropbox-related code within SwiftoDo, and rely on Apple’s and Dropbox’s native integration.</p>

<p>In a worst-case scenario, I won’t be able to get Files integration working without giving up too many features or conveniences of the current app.</p>

<p>So, after version 2.12.0 is released, you may not hear from me for some time about development, but I will be hard at work nonetheless.</p>

<h2>What does it mean, to me, to be an audiophile?</h2>

<p>So, <a href="https://mjdescy.me/2018/02/14/my-slide-into-audiophile-territory-part-1/">I’m an audiophile now</a>. What does that even mean? Am I just an overexcited consumer with enough disposable income to blow a lot of money on headphones? Hopefully there is more to it than that.</p>

<p>A lot of people, when talking about speakers or headphones, preface their comments with “I’m not an audiophile, but…” They do so out of humility, to admit their own limitations of hearing, and their own lack of experience discerning good sounding speakers from mediocre ones. What it is really about, however, is saying that you are not a snob. I used to do that, too. But I’ve given myself leeway to put myself in the audiophile camp, despite my lack of ear training and my lack of sophisticated acoustical measuring equipment. I want to take the term “audiophile” back from the snobs.</p>

<p>I call myself an audiophile now because I <em>love</em> sound. I love sound so much that I listen to music hours and hours each day. I love sound so much that I will listen to types of music I didn’t like before—EDM, hip-hop, country, standards, soundtracks—just because they <em>sound</em> good. I love sound so much I will spend large—but not obscene or unlimited—amounts of money on decent equipment.</p>

<p>My love of sound itself is a relatively new development. While I have loved music as long as I can remember, what  drove that love was always the melody, the song structure, the lyrics, and the performance—all the normal things people enjoy about music. The production, on the other hand, was not important to me. In fact, over-produced recordings turned me off, because studio slickness betrayed, in my opinion, the authenticity of the music.</p>

<p>Now, I think differently. I admire the craft of studio engineers in a way I never appreciate before. Some recordings just <em>sound</em> great, and that is part of the pleasure of listening to them. Similarly, some singers have have beautiful voices, and it doesn’t matter if they are singing the same old songs (<em>ahem</em>, standards): the sound of their voices brings life to the music and helps make it worthwhile to listen to.</p>

<p>To me, being an audiophile is about appreciating the  distinction between the <em>sound</em> and the <em>music</em>, and deriving pleasure from it, far more than it is about spending vast amounts of money on expensive equipment, or believing the hokum perpetrated by high-end audio equipment manufacturers and sellers.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Today I released the ninth update to <a href="https://swiftodoapp.com">SwiftoDo</a> in about ten weeks. What is driving all these small (but good!) releases? Two main things:</p>

<ol>
    <li>I want the app to get better</li>
    <li>I want to have fun</li>
</ol>

<h3>I want it to get better</h3>

<p>SwiftoDo is a good app, but it is by no means perfect. There are a lot of things that can be improved. My development task list for the app is a mile long. For a long time, the most important items on that list were also the most difficult for me to implement. To be honest, some of those “most important” improvements <em>feel like</em> they are beyond my current capabilities as a developer—but that doesn’t mean that I can’t make improvements somewhere. The app can still get better.</p>

<p>Sometimes, small things can make the app a lot better. Based on many emails with customers, I have learned that, a lot of times, a simple-to-implement feature, rather than a broad reimagining of a portion of the app, will make a big difference to their enjoyment of the app and the productivity they gain from it. That’s why I have been working on “small” features, such as the full file editor, that merely build on what was already there, but end up making the app more powerful and flexible for users. That is also my rationale behind improving application performance, which has become a much higher priority for me this year. Better performance benefits <em>everybody</em>.</p>

<p>I also decided to release features and fixes regularly and frequently. Every week I ask myself, “How can you make the app better for your customers?” And, on another day each week, I ask myself, “Is my latest commit better than what my customers have?” Once I’m sure the new version is better than the last version, I release it.</p>

<p>I figure that adding small features and fixing small bugs eventually accumulates, and my <em>good</em> app can eventually become a <em>great</em> app.</p>

<h3>I want to have fun</h3>

<p>I’m working on SwiftoDo because it the app is useful to me and because it is <em>fun</em>.</p>

<p>Coding is fun for me, but certainly not every minute of it. Sometimes I have to fight with UIKit’s quirks or work around its bugs, which can take hours of frustrating work. Sometimes I fail to get a feature working without introducing a crash or breaking something else in the app. Sometimes things just don’t work, and it’s really hard to figure out why. Sometimes I’m stuck, and that’s no fun.</p>

<p>I have decided not to remain stuck for more than a day or two anymore. If something isn’t working, I table the work and move onto smaller, solvable problems for a while. This philosophy has led me to work on features that seem simple, useful, and fun to code, but maybe not as important as the larger, more difficult things that have been blocking my progress. That explains why I’ve been pushing forward on improvements to the task text editor, for example, rather than adding new data providers. As a side benefit, working on those smaller things sometimes clears a way, either in the codebase or in my mind, to tackle those larger, more important items.</p>

<p>So, what’s fun? Racking up win after win, week after week, by pushing a better version of my app out to my users. And knowing, every day, that no matter what is <em>not</em> in the app yet, what <em>is</em> in the app keeps getting better.</p>

<h2>Version numbers</h2>

<p>SwiftoDo’s version number, currently at 2.9.2, is heading into the weird-looking, double-digit-minor-version-number terrority. The next version I release will be 2.10.0.</p>

<p>As Apple suggests, I’m using a 3-number <a href="https://semver.org">semantic version numbering</a> system, with my own rules for what increments each component. Architectural changes to the app (such as a total rewrite) will bump the first number. Adding new user facing features will bump the second number. Fixing bugs or enhancing existing features, in minor ways, will bump the third number.</p>

<p>Because I am releasing so often now, and batching fewer new user-facing features together, the minor version number has been increasing rapidly. No one should care what the version number is, as long as it goes up. I don’t really care if it is, eventually, version 2.50.0. I does look a little funny to me, though.</p>

<h2>What about the Mac version?</h2>

<p>I have not been releasing updates to <a href="https://swiftodoapp.com/desktop">SwiftoDo Desktop</a> recently. The main reason for that is that SwiftoDo Desktop is, basically, feature complete. Unfortunately, because it is coded in Objective C and relies on cell-based table views (mainly for the inline editing to work), it sits at a technological dead end. A total rewrite is in order.</p>

<p>I have prepared for this scenario. My todo.txt-related code is in a framework that can be ported over to the Mac easily. In fact, I have started and stopped a total rewrite of the Mac version a couple times now, but have never gotten that far into it. The things holding me back are:</p>

<ol>
    <li>I have to update my knowledge of AppKit, which is the Mac’s UI framework.</li>
    <li>The desktop app uses a different filtering system, which is a little harder to use than the iOS version’s filtering system, but it is much more powerful. I don’t really want to kill it off.</li>
    <li>SwiftoDo on iOS could always use more work, and it represents 70% of my user base.</li>
</ol>

<p>In June, Apple <em>may</em> announce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/01/31/apple-still-plans-combined-ios-mac-apps-in-2018/">a new framework</a> that would allow me to port my iOS code to the Mac much more easily. If that happens, my ability to provide an updated Mac version would be greatly improved.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I&rsquo;m listening tonight to a &ldquo;hi-res&rdquo; 24-bit, 96kHz lossless version of &ldquo;August and Everything After” through my good headphones, DAC, and amp tonight. I <em>love</em> this album. It helps that I was 15 when it came out, of course. But still, I think it is an emotionally rich artistic achievement. It surprised me when such an earnest, heartfelt record became wildly popular; only in the 1990s would that happen, I guess.</p>

<p>I compared this hi-res version, track by track, with two other versions I have on hand:
<ol>
    <li>my 16-bit, 44.1kHz ALAC rip from my original CD from 1992, and</li>
    <li>the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/august-and-everything-after/364936">256kbps AAC version</a> available through Apple Music.</li>
</ol>
Overall, all three versions sound almost identical, which is kind of what I would expect, actually, given that Apple Music&rsquo;s lossy AAC encodings are of a very high quality, and that the bit rates and bit depths for CD-quality recording and iTunes AAC encodings were chosen very carefully. We are <em>far</em> from the world of mushy, sizzly 128kbps MP3 files now. That said, the lossless versions <em>do</em> sound a tiny bit better. They reveal more detail than the lossy version, notably in the snap of the bass guitar and in the attack of the snare drum. The difference is slight: you have to listen very carefully to hear it, and you need equipment sensitive enough to reproduce the sounds accurately.</p>

<p>The main improvement the hi-res version brings over the CD-quality rip, to my ears, is a lower noise floor. Otherwise, it sounds the same as the CD version. You gain about 1-2% in fidelity at the price of lot of extra bits on the hard drive, and, perhaps, more dollars out of your wallet. This is true even though the 24-bit version was mastered to be a little quieter than the original CD and iTunes versions. You have to turn it up a notch to match the others&rsquo; volume. Even with more amplification, the hi-res version&rsquo;s noise floor is incredibly low, and everything sounds fantastic.</p>

<p>Overall, I would prefer to listen to all my music in lossless quality, in as high fidelity as possible. It can sound better than lossy rips, and, even if I can’t hear the difference on a particular track, why not listen to the best version available? That said, I subscribe to Apple Music, which serves AAC files, rather than Tidal, which has a lossless streaming plan, primarily for <em>convenience</em>. Fortunately, for me, Apple’s 256kbps AAC files are completely adequate substitutes for lossless rips. I do think, though, that if Apple offered a lossless plan at a slight up-charge, I would subscribe to it.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<blockquote>
This is the first in a series of posts about my realization that I have become an audiophile.
</blockquote>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I have realized recently that I have slowly but surely slipped from the category of “normal person” to the category of “audiophile”. I <em>never</em> would call myself an audiophile before, so this is somewhat shocking to me.</p>

<p>I always thought that audiophiles were people who threw away thousands of dollars, unnecessarily, on audio equipment&ndash;speakers, headphones, DACs, and so on—to “hear” “something” that I could never, ever hear myself, and was probably not even there. After realizing that I spent, probably, $1,000 or more on audio equipment last year, I think I need to brand myself with the “audiophile” label. I am listening to lots of music and enjoying it immensely, but there is something clearly wrong with me. (Just kidding—I think.)</p>

<p>A princely four-figure sum over the course of 2017 netted me some great equipment:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods/">Apple AirPods</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.oppodigital.com/headphones-pm-3/">Oppo PM3</a> headphones</li>
    <li>an <a href="https://www.oppodigital.com/headphone-amplifier-ha-2SE/">Oppo HA-2SE</a> DAC/headphone amp combo, and </li>
    <li>a <a href="https://www.beoplay.com/en/products/beoplaym3">BeoPlay M3</a> wireless speaker. </li>
</ol>

<p>Even with all that great stuff at my listening desk, I am <em>still</em> dying to buy a <a href="https://www.apple.com/homepod/">HomePod</a> (<a href="http://mjdescy.micro.blog/2018/02/06/after-reading-all.html">or two, even</a>), <a href="https://hifiman.com/products/detail/178">open-back headphones from HifiMan</a>, <a href="https://www.beoplay.com/en/landingpages/headphones#headphones">B&amp;O Play headphones</a> of some kind (did they just discontinue all their wired models?), and maybe a <a href="https://www.hifiberry.com">HifiBerry</a> or a piece of <a href="http://www.schiit.com">Schiit</a> to turn one of my old Raspberry Pis back into an AirPlay receiver.</p>

<p>I have no idea why this is. All I know is that the good audio equipment I have now has made all the other speakers in the house sound like garbage to me. In a way, I am <em>glad</em> I don’t have the money right now to buy any of this stuff. I certainly don’t need any of it, and it won’t make my life any better.</p>

<h2>What the hell happened?</h2>

<p>How did I slip from being a normal music listener to an audiophile or audiophile wannabe? I have a very good excuse—or, more likely, a series of somewhat poor excuses that snowballed into $1,000+ of spending on audio equipment in one year:</p>

<ol>
    <li>I adore listening to music, and spend a lot of time doing so. </li>
    <li>I got, for free a couple times, better headphones than the ones I had before.</li>
    <li>I started to hear “something” that these better headphones brought out of my music that I never had heard before. The <em>sound</em> of the music became as important to me as the content of the music.</li>
    <li>And then, those headphones broke, and I had to get new ones. This has happened multiple times to me over the past five years, which is a bummer <em>and</em> encouraged me to try to buy higher quality headphones each time. </li>
</ol>

<h2>So what?</h2>

<p>I thought it would be fun to write about all my gear from one the years, from the first crappy boombox to the amazing headphones and DAV/amp combo I am rocking these days. This is the first post in that series.</p>

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2018/02/09/strategies-to-increase.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-02-09 18:00:00 -0400">Feb 9, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a href="https://micro.blog/macgenie">Jean McDonald</a>, Community Manager of <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>, posted an essay today entitled &ldquo;<a href="http://micro.welltempered.net/2018/02/09/diversity-and-inclusion.html">Diversity and Inclusion at Micro.blog: Where We Are, Where We Want to Go</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
The question comes up regularly: to what extent is there diversity in the Micro.blog community? We only ask for a name and an email address to register, so we don’t have any demographics on the users in our community. But I do know, based on skimming the names of those who register, that the percentage of users with typically female names is very small. When I look at users whose avatars are photos of themselves, I suspect the percentage of people of color is also very small.
</blockquote>

<p>I have been thinking about diversity on the platform since I started using it, the day it opened to the public in December 2017. Jean&rsquo;s essay inspired me to publish some of my thoughts.</p>

<h2>What do we expect?</h2>

<p>The Micro.blog service has not been a publicly available for long. At this point, it is understandable that the first wave of users would be primarily composed of fans of its founder, Manton Reece. Manton is an iOS and macOS developer who blogs and podcasts about his development work and the indie web. If you have come across his work online, you are probably very much like him: an iOS or macOS developer, or at least a passionate user; a tech podcast listener; or a passionate blogger or IndieWeb aficionado. This core group is, for reasons related to historical and cultural biases, <em>not</em> a particularly diverse one.</p>

<p>This core group describes <em>me</em>, and certainly does not describe <em>everyone</em> on Micro.blog, but it does describe a lot of the users I found on the service&rsquo;s <a href="https://micro.blog/discover">Discover</a> page. Manton and Jean have expressed, from the very beginning, an earnest desire to create a safe community of independent micro blogs—&rdquo;safe&rdquo; from the abuse that silences disempowered people, women, and minorities on dominant social media platforms. They, along with the users of the platform, have openly discussed how to increase diversity, and the challenges inherent in doing so. I have learned a lot from reading these blog posts and discussions. Like them, I wish for Micro.blog to attract and retain a more diverse user base. The question we all face now is: how?</p>

<p>Here are a few ideas.</p>

<h2>Recognize and publicize that community guidelines are intrinsic to the product</h2>

<p><a href="https://micro.blog/macgenie/325883">Jean McDonald</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
No one should feel unwelcome here.
</blockquote>

<p>This should be one of the public-facing mantras that applies to the entire project, much like &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be evil&rdquo; was to Google for many years. Jean&rsquo;s quote should be atop the &ldquo;Community Guidelines&rdquo; page, and a link to that page should be near the top of the &ldquo;help.micro.blog&rdquo; page.</p>

<p>I think Micro.blog should put a lot more focus on the community guidelines and whatever technology or processes are used to enforce them. It&rsquo;s a key feature of the platform. People behaving <em>well</em> together is the core of the product for me, and a key differentiator between it and Twitter.</p>

<h2>Refine the marketing message</h2>

<p>What is Micro.blog, anyway? To <a href="https://indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a> people, it&rsquo;s kind of obvious. To everybody else, maybe not.</p>

<p>If asked, today, to sell it to someone, I might say: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the good parts of Twitter, with none of the bad parts.&rdquo; I might explain that microblogging is simply sharing something about yourself in public, and that Micro.blog is a <em>safe</em>, <em>respectful</em> place to do so, because it has protections against abuse, and strict community guidelines. If they are unsure why they should share thing in public, I would explain that it is <em>empowering</em> to do so. It is putting your best foot forward online.</p>

<h2>Promote on podcasts</h2>

<p>Having a simple, concise marketing message is essential, but that message needs to be spread somehow. One of the best ways to market these days is on podcasts.</p>

<p>Manton has a <a href="https://coreint.org">podcast</a> and a <a href="http://timetable.manton.org">microcast</a>, which have brought a lot of people to Micro.blog thus far. I think podcasts are a great opportunity to promote the open, inclusive, but safe nature of Micro.blog. While podcast audiences may, as a whole, skew white, male, and wealthy, there <em>are</em> tons of podcasts out there that are hosted by, feature as panelists, and cater to women and minorities. I&rsquo;m sure that Manton is adjacent enough to other tech podcasters to get some guest spots on tech podcasts that feature or cater to these groups.</p>

<h2>Ask users for help</h2>

<p>Micro.blog users are all, at this point, early adopters, and most of us are especially committed to the platform and want it to succeed. Ask us to publicize the service. Give us some ideas how to do that effectively, and in ways that will increase diversity. Provide incentives for us to sign up new people, such as additional badges (which are free to provide) or free months of Micro.blog hosting (which of course incurs a cost). I&rsquo;m sure something will come of it.</p>

<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>

<p>My list of suggestions is by no means exhaustive, and Manton and Jean are likely in a better position than I am to understand what they need to do, and what they can do. I do want to express that diversity is important for all of us, even white, male, Americans such as myself. If all people are treated with dignity and are allowed to participate in something (work, society, etc.), outcomes will be better, and life will be richer, for all of us. I have seen that firsthand at a small scale, and wish to see it at a much larger scale. Micro.blog is a good place to start.</p>

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2018/02/08/swiftodo-developer-notes.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-02-09 00:00:00 -0400">Feb 9, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a href="https://swiftodoapp.com">SwiftoDo</a> is a passion project for me. I love working on it, but, due to work and family obligations, I have very little time to do so. Consequently, I am <em>way</em> behind schedule in adopting features introduced in iOS 11. I also learned, the hard way, that <em>lots</em> of minor UI-related bugs popped up when I changed the app’s target iOS framework from 9.0 to 11.0. I have been slowly discovering and cleaning up those bugs, and adding minor features here and there, for the past two and a half months.</p>

<h2>Release cadence</h2>

<p>I have decided to release working code as soon as possible, rather than trying to batch features and bug fixes into larger releases. Therefore, I have been issuing new releases about once per week, the past few weeks. I will not be keeping up that release cadence, but I do want to reflect to my customers that the app is actively developed. More importantly, I want bugs to be fixed for all my users. I would much rather have a rock-solid, very simple app than an unstable one with lots of bells and whistles.</p>

<h2>Features </h2>

<p>That said, I do want to keep adding bells and whistles. I am working on adding drag-and-drop support at this point, and plan to look into adding clickable URLs and Siri support. I have a long list of other ideas and concepts drafted, too.</p>

<p>I would like to add additional data providers, other than Dropbox, but I have little exposure to coding networking code, and the third party libraries I’ve looked at look like more trouble than they are worth. For some perspective, Dropbox’s SwiftyDropbox library, which powers file sync now, is a great library, but is also the source of most of the mysterious crashes on startup that a small number of people have reported. What is frustrating to me, as a developer, is that I can’t really fix those crashes, because I don’t fully understand what causes them, and the code is in a library. I don’t want to open my app up to more instability just to add a data provider. Also, I have been loath to support iOS 11’s Files app integration, up to this point, because I don’t see how the todo.txt “Archive” function, which moves completed tasks to another file, would be able to work with it.</p>

<h2>Current focus</h2>

<p>I have way more ideas for features and improvements than time to complete them. My focus in the near term will be on stability and satisfying user requests that seem like they would be useful for a majority of my users. Hopefully that is good enough for now. It’s amazing how much work my simple, text-based task list app has been!</p>

         	<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>At my local grocery store, eye round roasts are relatively cheap and plentiful in the cold weather months. They are all cut to just over 2 lbs, as well, so this recipe works pretty well for me. If your roast is larger, set the oven&rsquo;s &ldquo;on&rdquo; time to 5 minutes per pound.</p>

<p>The exact measurements of the spice rub are not important, but it should consist of mostly salt. It is important to heavily salt the roast and to let it sit at room temperature for at least an hour prior to putting it in the oven. If the roast is too cold, it will not cook through properly.</p>

<p>I have found that these roasts leave enough fat in the pan to allow me to make a pan gravy with just a bit of flour (about 1 tbsp) and 1 cup of liquid (often just beef broth). (It there isn’t enough fat left over to make a roux, add butter to the flour.)</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1 eye round roast, 2 1/4 lbs</li>
    <li>4 tbsp kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 tsp onion powder, 2 tsp</li>
    <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<p>Dry off roast with paper towels.</p>

<p>Create a spice rub by mixing the kosher salt, black pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. Coat the roast on all sides with the spice rub. (You will likely not use all the spice rub.) Let it sit at room temperature for 1 hour.</p>

<p>Set an oven rack to the middle or upper middle position. Heat the oven to 500º F.</p>

<p>Coat the roast with a thin layer of olive oil and place it on a pan. A 12-inch cast iron or stainless steel skillet works fine. A rack is optional.</p>

<p>Put the pan in the oven and roast it for 10 minutes, or about 5 minutes per pound. Then, shut off the oven, and do not open it for 2 hours.</p>

<p>After 2 hours, the internal temperature of the roast should be about 145° F. Set the roast aside and, optionally, <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-an-easy-pan-sauce-in-minutes-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-211220">make a pan sauce from the drippings</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2018/01/15/chicken-sausage-and.html">Chicken Sausage and Escarole Soup Recipe</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2018/01/15/chicken-sausage-and.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-01-16 00:00:00 -0400">Jan 16, 2018</time></a>

         	<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>This is a hearty, pasta-free soup, fit for a winter meal. Lots of vegetables, sausage (either chicken or pork sausage can be used), and cooking liquid from cannellini beans (canned or homemade) lead to a chunky, filling soup with a rich mouth feel.</p>

<p>Developing a fond while cooking the sausage will add an important foundation to the soup&rsquo;s flavor. Deglazing this fond early, before cooking the vegetables in the same pot, will prevent it from burning.</p>

<p>Ideally, the vegetables should be soft but not browned; if they are not softening sufficiently during the sauté, simmer them longer in the broth, rather than extending the sauté.</p>

<p>You can substitute your preferred herbs for the Italian seasoning that I use. If using fresh herbs, add them at the very end, or just before serving.</p>

<p>If you wish to add pasta, ditalini works well. Cook the pasta separately, and add it just before serving, to avoid the pasta absorbing too much of the broth during cooking or storage.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1 12 oz package chicken sausage</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water or chicken broth, for deglazing</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped carrots</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped celery</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped yellow onion</li>
    <li>1 7 oz bag fresh chopped escarole</li>
    <li>2 15 oz cans cannellini beans, not rinsed or drained</li>
    <li>8 cups low sodium chicken broth</li>
    <li>1 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>(Optional) Fresh squeezed lemon juice, to taste</li>
    <li>(Garnish) Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<p>In a large pot or Dutch oven, brown the sausage in 1 tbsp of olive oil for 4 minutes per side over medium heat. This will likely not cook it through, which is fine; it will cook through later in the soup. Remove the sausage and set it aside.</p>

<p>Deglaze the pot with &frac12; cup water or chicken broth. Retain this liquid in a cup or bowl; it will be added back to the soup later. If the retained liquid contains any solids, strain it to remove them.</p>

<p>Once the par-cooked sausage is cool enough, cut it into coins and set it aside, to be added back to the pot later.</p>

<p>Dry out the pot and add 1 tbsp olive oil. Sauté the onion, carrots, and celery over medium heat until they are soft but not browned, about 10 minutes. If the vegetables are not completely soft after the sauté, that is OK; they can be softened after the liquid is added. Add the escarole and Italian seasoning and stir everything to combine.</p>

<p>Add the chicken broth, and add back the retained liquid from deglazing. Raise the temperature to high until the broth starts to boil; then lower the temperature to medium or medium low, to maintain a low simmer. Simmer until the vegetables are soft, which can take 5 to 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Add the cannellini beans, including their cooking liquid, and the sausage. (These ingredients are added later to avoid overcooking them, which would lead to split beans and tough sausage.) Continue to simmer until the sausage is cooked through, which will take only a few minutes.</p>

<p>Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste. If, at this point, the soup tastes dull, add some fresh squeezed lemon juice, little by little, until the broth tastes as bright as you want it to.</p>

<p>Serve topped with finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</p>

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2018/01/08/plaintext-productivity-still.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-01-09 00:00:00 -0400">Jan 9, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I am still using the <a href="http://plaintext-productivity.net">Plaintext Productivity</a> system that I wrote about in 2013. It is a productivity system, based primarily on plaintext files, for Microsoft Windows users. Since I published a few people have asked me to write an update to <a href="http://plaintext-productivity.net">Plaintext Productivity</a>. The fact is, the system has held up so well for me that I really don’t have any updates to report.</p>

<p>One reason my system remains pretty much the same as it was in 2013 is that the operating system it is based on, <em><a href="http://plaintext-productivity.net/index.html#why-is-windows-important-">Windows</a></em>, despite some cosmetic changes, remains pretty much the same as it was in 2013. Sure, it got a better UI when Windows 10 supplanted Windows 7 and 8, but Windows still <em>works</em> just as well and just as poorly. Another pillar of the system, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>, also had a design change recently, to display more crisply on high-DPI screens, but it, too, works pretty much the same as it did in 2013.
<h2>A little bit of history</h2>
I developed my <a href="http://plaintext-productivity.net">Plaintext Productivity</a> system slowly over the years, as a result of the limitations I faced on my relatively locked down work computers, and my frustration with third party productivity apps going out of business and disappearing over the years. Gradually, I stripped down my productivity system to <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">a great text editor</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt">todo.txt-format</a> task list (with <a href="http://benrhughes.github.io/todotxt.net/">a good client</a>), with some clever ideas about using a <a href="http://plaintext-productivity.net/2-09-work-journal.html">journal</a> for planning, and for <a href="http://plaintext-productivity.net/3-00-files-introduction.html">managing files</a>.</p>

<p>Because I was stuck on Windows, an operating system I did not particular like, I had to make do with built-in functionality, portable apps that I could sneak onto my system, and a universal file format: plaintext. Even this was challenging. Windows, for all it’s ubiquity, has a dearth of good <em>third party</em> (non-Microsoft) software for it. There is a lot of crapware in the Windows Store, several world class apps from Adobe that everyone knows about, and not that much in between. Macintosh, iOS, and to a far lesser extent, Android, have attracted the attention on small, boutique publishers and indie developers who have contributed great plaintext-based apps. <a href="https://swiftodoapp.com">Like me</a>.
<h2>Notes and drafts</h2>
I still firmly believe in <a href="http://plaintext-productivity.net/2-00-notes-and-drafts-introduction.html">writing lots of notes and drafts</a> to help document thoughts as well as meetings. I draft emails, write planning documents, write out procedures for work I have to repeat, and so on. I also keep a <a href="http://plaintext-productivity.net/2-09-work-journal.html">work journal</a> every day (well, I’m not perfect about writing it <em>every</em> single day, but I try). At the start of each workday, I write a short journal post to plan my top activities for the day. At the end of each workday, I wrote an even shorter journal entry to help remind me where I left things, which sets me up for the next day. I set up calendar entries to remind me to do these journal entries. These activities help keep me, a person who works remotely and alone, organized, engaged with my work, and on task throughout the day.
<h2>My text editor</h2>
<a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> is still my favorite Windows text editor. It is even better than when I first bought it, over five years ago, and it was worth every penny. I love that it is lean, fast, flexible, and handles both my short notes and huge data files with aplomb. Its plugin system makes it a serviceable Markdown editor. I have syntax highlighting for Markdown, HTML, todo.txt, TaskPaper, and the various programming languages I use at work: ACL scripts (which I created myself), SQL, C#, VBScript, and Python (and there are far more available).</p>

<p>Best of all, in my opinion, are its numerous, well-defined keyboard shortcuts for shifting lines around, selecting words, selecting whole lines, deleting whole lines, and so on. Its support for multiple text selection and multiple cursors makes certain quick edits, like making a bunch of lines a bullet list in Markdown, a snap; it’s actually kind of mind blowing when you get used to it. Lastly, I=its find and replace functionality is incredibly powerful as well, considering it supports regular expressions.</p>

<p>I have found no compelling reason to switch it out for a newer, shiner app—which is the whole point of having a simple productivity system in the first place.</p>

<p>I should say, though, that I do use Editorial or Ulysses on my iPad as a sidekick text editor quite frequently. I started to do so for a non-software related reason: my work machine’s mechanical keyboard is so loud that it bothers people on conference calls, while my iPad’s keyboard—the Apple Magic Keyboard—is so quiet that my phone does not pick it up. Those iOS apps are fantastic, but they are not vital to my Plaintext Productivity system.
<h2>My task list</h2>
I still <a href="http://plaintext-productivity.net/1-00-tasks-introduction.html">use todo.txt for my work task list</a>. Since I wrote Plaintext Productivity, I contributed a ton of patches to my favorite Windows todo.txt app: todotxt.net. I contributed multiple task selection and editing, and a lot of other things. I went on to write Mac and iOS todo.txt apps, <a href="https://swiftodoapp.com/desktop">SwiftoDo Desktop</a> and <a href="https://swiftodoapp.com">SwiftoDo for iOS</a>. I tend to use SwiftoDo for iOS most of the time, and revert to todotxt.net only when I don’t want to context-switch away from my PC to my iPad or iPhone. My todo.txt file is synced via Dropbox between all these apps, so it doesn’t really matter which app I use at any given moment.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt">Todo.txt</a> is the best system for me because my work, and my GTD-inspired way of looking at my work, tends to present itself as a large number of tasks that get picked up, dropped, and re-prioritized frequently. I have started to dabble with <a href="https://www.taskpaper.com">TaskPaper</a> for some of my planning needs, either in my daily work journaling, or when I have a self-directed project to plan, such as drafting a proposal or creating a software-based audit tool. TaskPaper is interesting, but I do too much sorting and filtering of tasks throughout the day for it to supplant todo.txt as my main task list system.</p>

<p>I don’t keep track of every task in my life in todo.txt, however. I prefer to keep my personal tasks separate from my work ones, mainly because I find having them commingled with work tasks distracts me from my work. Therefore, I keep my personal tasks in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205890">Reminders</a>, which has had solid Siri support and cross-Apple-device syncing since 2011, and has only gotten better since then. I <em>have</em> changed a lot about how I managed non-work tasks since 2013, but those fall outside my Plaintext Productivity system.
<h2>Filing and searching</h2>
I still use the same <a href="http://plaintext-productivity.net/3-00-files-introduction.html">filing system</a>, too, and have been consistently happy with it. While I believe that you should rely on search rather than elaborate folder structures for finding what you need to, Windows Search <em>still</em> is not great. Despite its weaknesses, and the frustrations those weaknesses sometimes cause, I still get by with it.
<h2>Hardware and other things</h2>
I also wrote about <a href="http://plaintext-productivity.net/4-05-hardware.html">hardware</a> and <a href="http://plaintext-productivity.net/4-00-other-tips.html">other things</a> in Plaintext Productivity. Since 2013, I have had the fortune to upgrade my keyboard to a 87-key mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Blue switches. I really like the clicky-clacky keyboard switches and the keyboard’s smaller size, which I credit with helping eliminate repetitive stress injuries in my wrists. I also made things easier on my eyes by upgrading my display from two 1080p monitors to one, much bigger, 4K display. Crisper text has reduced eyestrain and has made me much happier, though Windows has had, and <em>still has</em>, awful and inconsistent high-DPI support. I don’t miss having two screens at all, actually. I can tile two to four windows on screen, and use the virtual desktop feature that premiered in Windows 10, to get most of the benefits that multiple monitors afforded me in the past.
<h2>The future of plaintext productivity</h2>
I have never used the same productivity system for so long. It has been solid and reliable for me for years now, and required no real tweaks worth mentioning when upgrading from Windows XP to Windows 7 to Windows 10. I see no obvious need to replace or upgrade my system in the near future, either. Maybe someday, when everything is in virtual reality or something—but maybe not even then.</p>

         	<p>I&rsquo;m posting this for the benefit of <a href="https://micro.blog/traci">Traci</a> on <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>.</p>

<p>This is a simple, lazy recipe for the Instant Pot. It isn&rsquo;t entirely original, but it is extremely <em>useful</em>, and produces a result that everyone in my family will eat, which is no small feat.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t measure anything.  If I don&rsquo;t have salsa, I dump in tomato sauce or even just water; the result is more bland, but still edible, and it can be shredded and mixed with barbecue sauce if desired. I make this in the morning or at lunchtime and let it stay on Warm for hours and hours until dinnertime. I find the taste of chicken thighs improves after a couple hours on the Instant Pot&rsquo;s Warm setting.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>6 chicken thighs</li>
    <li>1 cup mild or medium salsa (eyeballed)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup water (eyeballed)</li>
    <li>2 large pinches kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Oil bottom of Instant Pot. </li>
    <li>Coat bottom of Instant Pot with 1 pinch of kosher salt.</li>
    <li>Add chicken thighs in one layer</li>
    <li>Season top of chicken thighs with 1 pinch of kosher salt.</li>
    <li>Cover with salsa. Add water if salsa is not very liquid. </li>
    <li>Lid the Instant Pot and cook under high pressure for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Allow pressure to release naturally. The Instant Pot will automatically switch to its Warm setting. Keep the chicken thighs on the Warm setting as long as you would like. The chicken tastes better after several hours on Warm.</li>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>One thing to do when you’re supposed to be writing is to fuss about your writing environment.</p>

<h2>Not wasting time</h2>

<p>Choosing the perfect writing font is a classic way to procrastinate—but it is not a waste of time. Fonts are important. A good font is not only highly legible, it also conveys a subliminal emotional effect on the reader. Naturally, it follows that it will also have similar effects on the writer. A good font will make you feel better while you are writing—maybe because you can read it more easily, or because you find elements of it, its curves or serifs, aesthetically pleasing. Whatever the reason, picking a font that is pleasing can have a profound effect on your writing.</p>

<h2>What makes a good writing font?</h2>

<p>For me, as a writer and programmer who began typing text on a computer in the 1980s, I gravitate toward <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font">monospaced fonts</a>. Every character in a monospaced font has the same width. This is useful in programming or for data files, because, in those uses, you often want to align columns of text. It is not useful at all in typesetting books, of course; text laid out in monospace fonts looks primitive and wide-open. Primitive and wide-open, however, are perfect attributes for text that I am writing, breaking apart, moving around, and recombining. Writing in monospaced fonts is, on a subconscious level, freeing. It helps me feel like nothing in my text is set in stone.</p>

<h2>Considerations</h2>

<p>Whether the font is monospaced or proportional is only part of what is important. Other things matter, too: the shapes of the characters; whether they have serifs or not; whether some look identical to others (l vs. 1, or O vs. 0, for example); and so on.</p>

<p>Beyond that, some fonts <em>render</em> better on screen than others. For example, Verdana and Georgia were commissioned by Microsoft specifically to be look good, clear, and legible <em>on screens</em>, rather than on paper. This was revolutionary at the time, as was their free-to-use licensing. Consequently, these two fonts were adopted almost everywhere on the web for a while. Georgia is still one of the eight font options in Apple’s iBooks ebook reader.</p>

<p>Your particular display and operating system have a lot to do with what font looks good. In general, displays are much higher resolution and much higher quality now than when Verdana and Consolas were invented. As you might expect, this means that all all scalable fonts look better on modern, high-resolution displays. Still, some fonts will look much sharper than others on some displays. For example, on my Dell 27” 4K display for my work machine, a Windows 10 laptop, Consolas looks the best for the terminal and any coding I am doing, and Sax Mono looks better for writing actual documents. These fonts don’t offer similar advantages to me on my Mac or on iOS, however. They look fine, but they really pop for me on my work machine.</p>

<h2>My favorite writing fonts over the years</h2>

<p>There are tons of monospaced fonts available. Here are a handful that I have used over the years, with the platform I used them on in parentheses. I recommend trying them in your text editor, especially the newer ones listed at the bottom.</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_(typeface)">Monaco</a> (Mac)</li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_(typeface)">Menlo</a> (Mac)</li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolas">Consolas</a> (Windows)</li>
    <li><a href="https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/">Source Code Pro</a> (Windows)</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/droid-sans-mono">Droid Sans Mono</a> (Windows, Android)</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/chrissimpkins/codeface/tree/master/fonts/sax-mono">Sax Mono</a> (Windows)</li>
    <li>IBM’s <a href="https://ibm.github.io/type/">Plex</a> (Mac, iOS, Windows)</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/tree/master/iA%20Writer%20Duospace">iA Writer Duospace</a> (Mac, iOS)</li>
</ol>

<p>These are listed in the order in which I have adopted them. I tend to use only a few at a time, depending on which one looks best on my hardware and software at the moment. Below, I highlight two of my favorite, very much related, fonts for writing these days: Plex and iA Writer Duospace.</p>

<h2>IBM’s Plex</h2>

<p>IBM released <a href="https://ibm.github.io/type/">Plex</a>, an open source font that will be used in all of IBM’s published materials going forward, in late 2017. It isn’t the only open source font that’s free for anyone to download and use, but it is a really good one. Plex Mono, its monospaced variant, looks fantastic on my iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Its edges are crisp, and the stroke has a consistent width; it looks like the lines fit just right in the pixel grid that makes up the screen.</p>

<h2>iA Writer Duospace</h2>

<p>The iOS development company iA took IBM’s Plex Mono and tweaked it a little bit to make it even better, in their opinion, for writing. They kept the font monospaced <em>except for M’s and W’s</em>. It’s a pretty simple change, but a lot of thought went into it. <a href="https://ia.net/topics/in-search-of-the-perfect-writing-font/">iA Writer’s article about this process</a> is absolutely fascinating—I highly recommend reading the whole thing.</p>

<p>The resultant font, iA Writer Duospace, looks great on my MacBook Pro. I prefer Plex Mono on my iPad and iPhone, though. There is something about the wider W and M that looks different in the two platforms. It could just be that my iOS screens are a lot smaller, and width is at a greater premium. It could also just be that I prefer my letters to line up vertically, especially when my text is constrained to a narrow column.</p>

<h2>Perfect, for now</h2>

<p>For now, I am very happy writing in Plex and iA Writer Duo on my Apple devices. I still happily use SaxMono and Consolas on the PC for writing notes and coding, though Plex Mono is starting to creep into use for my todo.txt file and in other places. Every year or two I look for something better, but I probably won’t change from these four main fonts until I get new hardware, which could change how everything is rendered, but that is probably a long way off.</p>

         	<p>I started this blog in the summer, and since then I have published 30 posts, including this one. As far as output goes, I have met my goal, and I am happy with that.</p>

<h2>Most popular posts</h2>

<p>In the spirit of publishing year-end best-of lists, here are my top five most popular posts from 2017:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="https://mjdescy.me/2017/11/06/ulysses-a-peerless-writing-tool/">Ulysses, a peerless writing tool</a>, a short essay about my favorite writing software. I love good software, and think <em>way too much</em> about what makes productivity software, well, more productive.</li>
    <li><a href="https://mjdescy.me/2017/08/03/choosing-an-ipad-pro-keyboard/">Choosing an iPad Pro Keyboard</a>, in which I compare three of the main keyboards iPad users like me might be considering.</li>
    <li><a href="https://mjdescy.me/2017/09/27/comparing-todotxt-and-taskpaper-formats/">Comparing todo.txt and TaskPaper formats</a>, which are two plaintext task list formats. I love plaintext, love productivity software, and love not having lock-in with proprietary software vendors. I have been using both formats for different planning and task management tasks at work all year.</li>
    <li><a href="https://mjdescy.me/2017/10/06/three-ways-to-create-nested-projects-in-todotxt-2/">Three ways to create nested projects in todo.txt</a>, which addresses a common problem with the todo.txt format.</li>
    <li><a href="https://mjdescy.me/2017/10/10/contexts-in-getting-things-done-and-todotxt/">Contexts in Getting Things Done</a>, in which I describe the challenges I faced dealing with contexts in the GTD system.</li>
</ol>

<p>These posts reflect some of my main interests: productivity software and systems, and Apple hardware. I have also written a little bit about Android, the Essential Phone, and  parts of the free and open web that interest me.</p>

<h2>Thoughts on the writing process</h2>

<p>One thing that I have learned this year, from writing regularly again, is how much work it can be to complete a blog post. I have a half-dozen incomplete blog post drafts in my Ulysses library at any given moment. Shaping them into something worth reading is a lot of work—work that I don’t often complete as quickly as I would like. Even a simple 500-word post has to be written and re-written three or four times before I think it is worth publishing.</p>

<p>The writing process is valuable to me, though. Writing is a lot different than analyzing data (my day job) or writing code (my nighttime hobby). Writing, re-writing, and revising help me <em>think</em> and help me <em>focus</em> in ways that my more mathematically-focused activities do not. Plus, it feels good to communicate to the world, and to own all the content I produce and publish it on my own platform, under my own name.</p>

<h2>The future</h2>

<p>I plan to blog regularly in 2018, both on this site and on <a href="https://mjdescy.micro.blog">mjdescy.micro.blog</a>. I have even set up regularly scheduled reminders (Apple Reminders, naturally) to help keep me on track. Thanks for reading.</p>

         	<p>I started a micro blog at <a href="https://mjdescy.micro.blog">mjdescy.micro.blog</a> this week. It is not to replace this blog, but to supplement it with a more frequently updated stream of short comments and asides about my life, or about news items that directly affect my life in some way. I want it to be like Twitter was for me back when I first joined it: a stream of consciousness, and a window into my life. My plan is to keep this blog (my <em>macro</em>-blog?)  free of micro blog posts and life blogging, and more focused on longer articles, bigger ideas, and more complete thoughts—as it has been from the very start.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/12/05/drafts-for-ios.html">Drafts for iOS</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/12/05/drafts-for-ios.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-12-06 00:00:00 -0400">Dec 6, 2017</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a href="https://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> is a tinkerer’s DIY dream of a text editor. It nails the basics, and allows you to customize its editor and its tag and folder system to fit your specific needs—it just takes a little time (and, maybe, some JavaScript skills, for some things) to do so.</p>

<h2>Drafts is where text begins</h2>

<p>Drafts, by Agile Tortoise, isn’t exactly an unknown app. On the contrary, it is one of the crown jewels of the iOS platform. It is one of the few apps with an in-app purchase tip jar that I actually threw money in—a few times, actually. Drafts makes my life simpler, in little ways, every day. Like one of my other favorite writing apps, Ulysses, it is a pleasure to use.</p>

<p>Drafts is primarily meant for quick text entry, and then pushing that text to another app for processing or storage. For example, I type most calendar entries and Google searches in Drafts (which is in my home screen toolbar) and, in two taps, open them for processing in Fantastical or Safari (which are not in my toolbar). Drafts 4, which has been out quite a while now, expands on that basic idea, and delivers a very useful utility and a top-notch text editor.</p>

<h2>Not just for automation—for writing!</h2>

<p>Drafts is already well known for its automation capabilities. It is great for drafting a tweet and posting it to Twitter (either natively or via another app), or for writing out a calendar entry and pushing it to <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical-ipad">Fantastical</a> or <a href="https://readdle.com/products/calendars5">Calendars 5</a> for parsing. What it is not well known for—but should be—is that it is the most customizable text editor on iOS. <a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">Editorial</a> has long held that crown, thanks to its its support of snippets and extensibility with Python scripts. Drafts, however, outdoes Editorial when it comes to customizing the editor itself, which has a profound effect on  <em>writing</em> experience.</p>

<p>In Drafts, <em>actions</em> can change the text your are writing, send some or all of it to another app, turn on/off night mode within the app, and so on. You can download actions from <a href="https://drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com">the developer’s extensive library</a>, of, if you are a bit of a programmer, you can them yourself in JavaScript, from within the app. You can assign these actions to the main menu, which is accessible from the top-right icon, or from a swipe to the left. That’s the basic stuff. You can <em>also</em> assign these actions to a custom toolbar that is displayed over the keyboard. Even better, for hardware keyboard users, you can assign your own hardware keyboard shortcuts to these actions, too. No other iOS app that I use does this!</p>

<p>I use Drafts on my iPad primarily for writing notes, such as when I get a phone call or am in a meeting. I use my custom toolbar buttons to input today’s date, paste text, format headings and lists in Markdown, send various lines (text selections) to my todo.txt file (via Dropbox), and so on. At the end of my writing session, I send the entire note to Dropbox for storage.</p>

<p>Notes don’t have to be exported, however. They can stay in Drafts and sync to all your other iOS devices via iCloud. You can also organize them there. There are three basic folders—Inbox, Archive, and Trash—to put notes into. You can flag notes for future retrieval, and filter them them by folder, flag status, and keywords (search terms within the note text) into custom “folders” or saved searches as well. I have not switched over to using Drafts as a full-fledged notes app (most of my drafts get automatically deleted after 30 days in the Trash folder), but I am thinking about it.</p>

<h2>Drafts in the future</h2>

<p>Drafts 4 has been around for a while now. Drafts 5 is coming, someday, with even more features: TaskPaper editing is a feature that I am looking forward to. I expect the pricing model to change from paid upfront to a subscription; I will be happy to pay for it, as a valuable companion to <a href="https://ulyssesapp.com">Ulysses</a> for writing, and a valuable sidekick to practically every other app in the iOS ecosystem.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I love Twitter. So much information and commentary is shared there, so quickly, that it is a vital source for “what is going on on the Internet today”. At the same time, I hate Twitter, for all the bad behavior performed on the platform that Twitter, the company, tolerates. I’m not alone. A lot of people I follow feel the same way. I see tweets like this almost every day:
<blockquote>Brad DeLong: “I wish there was a network like twitter, but not, you know, actually Twitter”</blockquote>
&nbsp;
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The folks at <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@twitter</a> are spineless cowards.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I wish there was a network like twitter, but not, you know, actually twitter</p>

<p>— Dave DeLong (@davedelong) <a href="https://twitter.com/davedelong/status/936365347615137793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>The thing is, practically since Twitter’s inception, alternatives <em>did</em> exist. I know. I used them: Identi.ca, StatusNet (the successor to Identi.ca), Pump.io (the successor to StatusNet), and App.net (a for-fee Twitter that got a lot of press but not so many users). And, I abandoned them and went back to Twitter, despite its flaws. So did everybody else.
<h2>Why is Twitter so sticky, and nothing else is?</h2>
What makes Twitter is valuable not what it does—microblogging is relatively easy to implement these days—but <em>who is on it</em>: Famous people! Intellectuals! Politicians! Journalists! These people and many more are not only publishing there, but reading there, too. Communication with, and between, influential people there can be two-way, and is usually in public, which is fascinating to read and unlike any other communications platform that had come before it. Twitter can amplify the voice of the non-famous and non-published people, too—the under-represented—which is often great.
<h2>Why is Twitter described as a cesspool?</h2>
Sometimes, though, amplifying under-represented voices is <em>not</em> great. Some voices are under-represented because they are malicious: Racists! Nazis! Liars! Sexist doxxers! Spammers! Russian bots! Malicious people have unique incentives to exploit and abuse a communications platform like Twitter. First, simply <em>having</em> a medium and a platform to spread their message is unique to them, because these people have been barred or banned elsewhere from spreading their message. Second, access to this new platform may be fleeting, because they could be banned there, too, for the same reasons they have been banned elsewhere. Third, people who want to spread malice are not the type of people who are concerned with preserving the health of the platform’s community, or the platform’s reputation in the wider world. Therefore, they can destroy the platform in the process of spreading their message.
<h2>Why can’t Twitter fix this?</h2>
The world is too complex to separate people, or Twitter users, into good and bad actors. What is unpopular or under-represented today may be celebrated tomorrow; it may be true and worth spreading today. Understandably, Twitter doesn’t want to choose who gets to speak on their platform. Therefore, they tolerate hate speech on their platform to a degree that makes some of their users angry. It puts the company in a difficult position when hate speech is broadcast (retweeted) by the President of the United States, as it was this week.</p>

<p>I understand Twitter’s problems as a company. It needs eyeballs on it to sell ads. Controversy on the platform, and the sheer number of active users (whether they are real people or bots), lead to greater traffic, greater revenue, and greater return on investment for their investors—at least in the short run. In the long run, however, poisonous speech on the platform poisons the platform.
<h2>What to do about it, as a Twitter user?</h2>
Basically, it is hard to see how, as users, we can improve Twitter. Twitter, the company, owns the platform. Consequently, it has the sole power to fix its flaws. Improvements to blocking and reporting abuse that Twitter has implemented have not satisfied the users who need them the most.</p>

<p>Moving away from Twitter entirely, onto another, similar platform, can work for small communities who primarily wish to communicate amongst themselves. It is unlikely, however, that a critical mass of influential users—the celebrities, journalists, etc., who make the platform valuable—will move to a different platform at this point. Without those users, another platform, however superior from a technical or community management standpoint, would not have as much value.</p>

<p>As a Twitter user, you really have two choices now: live with the abusive users, and report and block them as well as you can; or, if Twitter abuse is bothering you enough (or worse, threatening to your safety), stop using Twitter entirely. That is a sad conclusion to make, but I think it is realistic. Twitter’s ad-based model, need to generate both traffic and return on investment to satisfy its shareholders are, in the short run, at odds with its stated goal to improve safety, and therefore community, on its platform.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are other ways to write content on the internet for free, such as <a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress</a>. The problem is, you may never achieve the same reach with these other platforms as you would with Twitter. That is why I am sticking with Twitter myself. From a moralistic point of view, I would love to ditch it for something else. Despite that feeling, I get enough value from Twitter to keep using it, despite the sick-to-my-stomach feeling the Twitterverse gives me some days.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I learned about the <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a> blogging platform today. It looks awesome, especially with its simplified feature set (just what I need, nothing else), strict adherence to Markdown for writing, well-designed multi-platform front-end applications, and so on.</p>

<p>Mostly, Ghost’s <em>speed</em> impresses me. I <em>hate</em> how slow WordPress (the software that powers this blog) is compared to, say, a static website or a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jeckyll</a> blog. I love fast-loading websites, and went out of my way to create static sites for <a href="http://1000umbrellas.com">1000umbrellas.com</a> and <a href="http://plaintext-productivity.net">plaintext-productivity.net</a> for that very reason.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I doubt I will ever use Ghost. I am very dedicated to <a href="https://ulyssesapp.com">Ulysses</a> as a writing tool, and Ulysses does not publish directly to Ghost. It publishes directly to <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, which is the main reason why I use WordPress. (Sure, there are <a href="https://ulyssesapp.com/blog/2016/10/eline-explains/">workarounds</a> for publishing from Ulysses to Ghost, but nothing beats a one-step solution.) WordPress is also ubiquitous, making it <em>very</em> cheap and easy to self-host.</p>

<p>I could pay more for faster WordPress hosting, but, considering how few readers I have, I can’t justify the additional expense. So, for the foreseeable future, I will enjoy easy publishing to WordPress via Ulysses, extremely cheap hosting expenses, and my readers will have to wait a second or two for my blog to load. I hope nobody else minds.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/11/29/back-to-rss.html">Back to RSS and the Indie Web</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/11/29/back-to-rss.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-11-30 00:00:00 -0400">Nov 30, 2017</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>At the end of last year, I quit using RSS. It was a big step for me. I had been using RSS practically since it first became available. My first <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> reader was the <a href="http://sagerss.com">Sage</a> plugin for FireFox, which I started using in 2004. I subscribed to <a href="www.slate.com">Slate</a>, <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com">LifeHacker</a>, a couple other professional publications, and a fairly large number of personal blogs, covering topics ranging from technology, economics, and personal finance to cooking and television shows. I was obsessive about skimming my feed many times a day, reading every headline, and often every article, of Slate and my favorite blogs.</p>

<p>I eventually dropped Sage for <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader">Google Reader</a>, and used it, and later Feedly, as a back-end to whatever smartphone RSS reader I was using. For years I checked my feeds a dozen times a day, read a ton of articles (though not all of them, as I used to), and generally felt pretty happy with the experience.
<h2>Why I quit using RSS</h2>I stuck with RSS <em>long</em> after I became a habitual Twitter user, long after I started to see articles linked to from Twitter before they hit my RSS reader, and long after most technology writers and podcasters started disparaging RSS as some antiquated technology that, like dial-up internet service, was hopelessly out of date.</p>

<p>Eventually, though, I quit using RSS—not because it was uncool, but because it was no longer making me happy. Like those writers and podcasters said, the basic need RSS fulfilled for me—keeping current, and entertained with fresh reading material—<em>was</em> being fulfilled by other services. Twitter did so more timely, and with more commentary from the writers. News aggregators, such as Apple News, did so with a slicker visual style. (I am emphatically <em>not</em> a regular Facebook user, so I miss out on whatever is going on there.)</p>

<p>I thought these services were more hip, modern, and fun than RSS. Most importantly, I thought they were keeping me <em>more current</em>. After all, for a long time, my RSS reader (the wonderful <a href="#">Reeder app for iOS</a>) fed me the same articles that I had already seen on Twitter. Worse, it fed me five or six different publications’ takes on the same subject every day, which was interesting a few days of the year (such as when reviews of new Apple devices hit the streets), but was otherwise completely redundant.
<h2>What I missed without RSS</h2>After a year RSS-free, I started to think something was missing. I was literally missing articles that I would like to read, especially those from bloggers I liked, such as <a href="http://ericasadun.com">Erica Sadun</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net">John Gruber</a>, because they would pass by in the timeline before I would see them. I was missing bloggers’ voices in general, because most of my Twitter list (like everybody’s, I’m sure) is heavily <em>news</em> related. I could keep up with what the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com">Washington Post</a> are publishing each day pretty well; but what about what <a href="http://www.manton.org">Manton Reece</a> and <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com">Tyler Cowlin</a> are publishing? Their voices were being buried in my Twitter feed by the daily (hourly?) news cycle.</p>

<p>Without RSS, I missed the spirit of the independent web: all those individuals and small publications who are sharing knowledge and expressing opinions that don’t fit into 140 characters, or even 280.
<h2>Back to RSS (and Atom, and JSON Feed)</h2>After many months away from it, I realized that RSS wasn’t the problem—I was. I wasn’t using RSS in a way that made me happy. Worse, I supplanted it with Twitter, which both sucked up all my attention every day, and reduced my attention span for content to 140 characters (a length perfect for snipes and jabs and headlines, but insufficient for most cogent thoughts). Fortunately, RSS has not died since the rise of Twitter and Facebook. It has quietly remained a fundamental internet technology, undergirding nearly every online publishing platform. Many, many sites support it without advertising it the way they used to ten years ago. Luckily, any good client can find feeds using just the site URL.</p>

<p>Not only RSS is still there: my longstanding RSS software is still there, too. Like in 2013, I am using <a href="http://reederapp.com/ios/">Reeder</a> on iOS as a front end, and <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> as a back end. Reeder has been around almost as long as the App Store. It is rarely updated, but it just works. It’s simplicity, elegance, and stability make it one of the finest apps on the platform. Feedly, the back end service that actually checks my feeds, is a free service that I basically never look at. I don’t use their website. I don’t use their app. I don’t really know or care how they make money off of me. It, like Reeder, is solid, stable, and just works.
<h2>Using RSS with a different perspective</h2>After returning to my RSS reader after such a long break, I had thousands of unread items and dozens of subscriptions. I decided to start over, so I unsubscribed to all my feeds, and started thinking about what I really wanted to get out of RSS, and, in general, out of the Internet.</p>

<p>I decided to use RSS differently now. I no longer need it to drink the content firehose and keep current with the minute-by-minute news cycle; Twitter is available for that, for good or ill. Instead, RSS enables me to follow a few interesting voices on the Internet, read their actual, in-depth thoughts, and not miss anything they have to say.</p>

<p>To these ends, I no longer follow big media sites. Primarily, I follow blogs: <em>real</em> blogs, written by actual people, rather than published by massive organizations. I’m mostly following Apple-focused tech bloggers and Swift programmers, which reflects my favorite hobbies—but that’s just what I’m doing for now. Lastly, I’m not checking my RSS feeds a hundred times per day. I am checking only a one or two times per day, and often I don’t have any updates. Instead of adding more feeds, I just accept it now. Sometimes there’s nothing new to read, and that’s OK.</p>

<p>I’m happy with RSS again. All it took was figuring out what I really needed to get out of it, and taking control of how I used it. It’s a really great technology, no matter how passé or uncool it seems to be.</p>

It eschews common word processing features (such as rich text formatting) and some high-end “writing app” features (storyboarding, a character name generator, etc.) in favor of a stark, clean interface and generalized organizational tools (a unified library of “sheets” that can be organized in folders or with keywords).</p>

<p>In a way, its <em>lack</em> of features is its greatest feature. It focuses on the text, both from a writing standpoint and a publishing standpoint. That’s what writers should do—and <em>want</em> to do (really!). But writing is hard work. It requires incredible focus, and achieving and maintaining that focus is really hard. Just about anything is easier than writing most of the time. That’s why writers, famously, procrastinate. Sometimes, though, writers get into a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/concept-flow-help-get-in-zone-work-brad-stulberg-2017-9">flow state</a>, just like software developers do, and any distraction will break that flow. App-induced distractions are particularly unwelcome. The worst offenders, ironically, tend to be features that promise to help make your writing process easier—especially if those features don’t exactly gel with what you are doing.</p>

<p>Ulysses gets that. Its feature set is intentionally uncomplicated and applicable to a broad base of writers. It hides some of its most powerful functionality, such as its awesome publishing features, until you actually need it. It doesn’t impose any system, workflow, or rules on you. Its simple system of sheets, folders, and keywords allows you to build your own organizational system that is specific to your projects—or, alternatively, to ignore organization until you absolutely need it. Most importantly, it puts the focus on the text, right where it needs to be.</p>

         	<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Phone-Unlocked-Display-Camera/dp/B074BWGRKH/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;linkId=a240e9da453bf8ed853a813662ed6cc7">Essential Phone</a> has been making some interesting moves in the market lately.</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="https://www.essential.com">Essential</a> dropped its asking price by $200.</li>
    <li>Essential released their second monthly software update, which improved performance (smoother scrolling! faster camera app!) and added some gesture support to the fingerprint sensor on the back.</li>
    <li>Essential is releasing new colors, starting with Pure White, which looks really good.</li>
</ol>

<p>It has had a reputation amongst tech writers and podcasters as a market failure. This reputation was somewhat deserved. At launch, it had its share of problems. Its camera app was slow, unstable, and took inferior pictures. Some people (not me) experienced lag in the user interface, mostly micro-stutter while scrolling (a common Android defect). The speaker grill had a tendency to fall out. Reports circulated that only an embarrassingly low 5,000 units had been sold in the first few weeks.</p>

<p>Essential has almost completely fixed these problems. The camera app is faster and takes better photos. The user interface runs more smoothly than ever; micro-stutter is gone. I had the misfortune to have the speaker grill defect on my phone, but they RMA’d it within three days, and the new phone has a different grill design. I think the recent drop in sales price by $200, to a more reasonable $499, will probably make a huge difference in sales volume.</p>

<p>I feel heartened that they are working hard to solve their problems, and get their phone (which is pretty great) into more people’s hands. People <em>are</em> coming around—case in point, these articles:</p>

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/10/29/what-makes-you.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-10-29 23:00:00 -0400">Oct 29, 2017</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I wonder this, as smartphones are maturing into what may be their final form: bezel-less slabs of glass with high-res screens, microphones, and sensors, that all look pretty much the same. The iPhone 8, for example, is the fourth generation of iPhone with the same basic form factor. A few years back, this would have been unheard of. A few years from now, though, I wouldn’t be surprised if there still is a “legacy” iPhone out there with this form factor, discounted several hundred dollars below what the iPhone X form-factor phone of the day will cost.</p>

<p>If all smartphones have the same basic shape, does it even matter which one you have? I think it does. You can still hate one phone and love another with the same case design. There are other things that matter, beyond the obvious distinction in operating system and/or Android skin. My experience with the iPhone 6S vs. the iPhone 7 is a case in point.</p>

<h2>Nearly identical phones can be vastly different</h2>

<p>Last September, I traded in my one-year-old iPhone 6S Plus for an iPhone 7 Plus, though Apple’s iPhone upgrade program. I hadn’t originally intended to do this. I had always kept my phones for two full years, and I chose the iPhone upgrade plan to get a nice monthly payment that also included AppleCare+.</p>

<p>The reason why I upgraded last year is that, after a year with it, I decided that I <em>hated</em> the iPhone 6S Plus. My 6S Plus was <em>fine</em>, and I never had any problems with the hardware or software, but I never really liked it, for several reasons. First, it was big, and I wasn’t used to big phones at that point. Second, it was ugly: the space gray aluminum finish was dull and drab. Third, it was ungainly: not only was it a large phone that strained my hand and my pockets, but its edges were smooth and slippery. Its Apple leather case was awful, too: it had mushy, hard to distinguish buttons, and its patina became slick and unpleasant after only a few months of wear. (Yes, I know the leather case is <em>not</em> the phone, but as it was an Apple product released alongside the phone, I think it is fair to include it in my assessment here.) The phone’s camera and software ecosystem were great, but it didn’t feel good in my hand, and that is crucial to how attached you can get to a handheld device.</p>

<p>While I grew to hate the iPhone 6S Plus, I quickly grew to love the iPhone 7 Plus. This surprised me, because the 7 Plus is <em>basically the same phone</em>. Sure, it has several major improvements—most notably, dual rear cameras and a much faster processor. Its minor improvements, however, contribute a lot more to my love for it. First, it looks great: the black finish is gorgeous and even blends seamlessly with Apple’s black leather case. Second, it feels great: I like the feel of the back much better, and the Apple leather case that came out with it has better quality leather, and clicky buttons on the sides. Its Taptic Engine, which provides force feedback for 3D Touch, the home button, and various user interface interactions, is absolutely amazing. It makes certain interactions, like scrolling picker views, 3D touching app icons, or pressing the home button, feel like you are interacting with actual, three-dimensional objects. It doesn’t vibrate as much as tap you with a reassuring, nearly soundless thud. The force feedback feels so good that it is almost addicting. It’s the kind of thing you would never think is important before you have it, but you don’t want to live without it once you do—like having heated seats in your car, for instance, or even the Apple Watch.</p>

<h2>It isn’t just about the iPhone</h2>

<p>I have the Essential Phone, now, too, which runs Android. I love it, too, though not as much as the iPhone. Why I love it, however, is a similar story to the one above, but it takes into account other manufacturers’ phones as well.</p>

<p>The Essential is one of a new breed of “bezel-less” phones. (These phones all still have bezels or notches or cutouts somewhere.) It is a smaller phone with a larger screen, much like the iPhone X, Pixel 2 XL, and Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Its lack of bezels make it smaller, and therefore easier to hold and pocket, than my iPhone 7 Plus, and other flagship phones of yesteryear.</p>

<p>Its glass screen and ceramic back make it like an impossibly smooth and cool piece of jet black soap. Its flat sides and smooth edges make it just grippy enough to feel secure in the hand, as opposed to slippery and droppable. <em>Holding it</em>, rather than using it, is the luxurious part of the experience. It feels just fantastic in the hand.</p>

<p>It doesn’t hurt that it has snappy performance as well—but you could get that from other phones as well. In fact, I vastly prefer it to the Samsung Galaxy phones and Pixel phones (the last generation, alas) that I’ve held. While those are the top Android phones in performance, hardware design, and features, I just don’t like them. It’s hard to put my finger on <em>exactly</em> why, but the materials and case design do not suit my tastes at all. They feel icky to me, in a way the Essential Phone never did.</p>

<h2>The emotional connection</h2>

<p>It isn’t 100% rational what makes a piece of technology suit you. It’s <em>emotional</em>. And sometimes the most subtle things—such as the color and feel of the materials, or the quality of the haptic feedback—can make you love a phone, or hate it.</p>

<p>Great haptic feedback is a major contributor to why the iPhone 7 Plus is my favorite phone. It feels great, and it feels <em>alive</em> when I touch it. I didn’t expect that feature to even matter to me, let along <em>bind</em> me to that particular model of phone. But it did. I don’t think most handset manufactures get that. After all, <em>feeling</em> is not a checklist feature.</p>

<p>I think Apple <em>does</em> get it, and little things like the Taptic Engine feeling so different than anything else are intentional parts of their industrial design and marketing strategies. Their industrial design and marketing teams have started (first, in my opinion, with the Apple Watch, and then with the iPhone 7), to really concentrate on what makes personal technology <em>personal</em>—that emotional connection you can have to your devices. And what they are doing is certainly working on me.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/10/27/thoughts-on-android.html">Thoughts on Android and iOS UI evolution</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/10/27/thoughts-on-android.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-10-27 23:00:00 -0400">Oct 27, 2017</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>One of <a href="https://mjdescy.me/2017/10/21/the-essential-phone/">the Essential Phone</a>’s core features is that it runs stock Android, rather than a flashy but slow and heavyweight skin like Samsung’s TouchWiz. Using this phone has been my chance to reacquaint myself with Android after a six year break, which was, in many ways, more interesting to me than testing out a phone with a cutting-edge, “bezel-less” design.</p>

<p>My last Android device was a Motorola Droid, running CyanogenMod’s version of Android Froyo. By the time I was able to upgrade to an iPhone 4S, in 2011, I wanted to throw the Droid against the wall. While it had lots of cool apps and was packed with features, it was so unreliable that I could barely make calls or take pictures with it any more. The iPhone, in comparison, seemed restrained and tasteful in design, fast and efficient in processing, and 100% reliable. What it lacked in customizability, it gained in simplicity and stability.</p>

<h2>What happened to Android in the past six years?</h2>

<p>Stock Android has changed less than I expected since my days running CyanogenMod on my Droid. When I unboxed the Essential phone, I was surprised right away that Google’s phone setup process was essentially unchanged since 2011. It worked well then, though, and it worked just as well today.</p>

<p>That same “it if ain’t broke, don’t fix it” attitude has been applied to be base Android OS features, too: the home screen, notification shade, app drawer, and so on were pretty much unchanged as well. Again, they are functional, and, unlike on iOS, <em>replaceable</em> by third party software; understandably, improving them must be a low priority for Google.</p>

<p>Android’s largest transformation since 2011, at least from a user’s perspective, is the introduction of Material Design. Google introduced Material Design in 2014 as the default design language on Android. It is, undoubtedly, an improvement over what had come before, but its principles are not universally applied, and don’t necessarily make apps easier to use in every case.</p>

<p>I don’t think Material Design has had a big effect on how Android apps are designed or used. Some indie developers never bothered to adopt it. Even on apps from big companies with large, talented, and nimble development teams, screen layouts are still dominated by hamburger buttons and slide-out menus, which leads to tedious navigation between parts of an app, and low discovery of key features. Also, sharing information between apps is still run through the same kind of share sheets used in 2011, which, ironically enough, can’t be customized as much as iOS share sheets can.</p>

<p>After a month or so of Android use, I concluded that Android runs more smoothly on high-end hardware than it did five years ago, but it is practically unchanged from a user experience perspective. As an iOS user, this is shocking, because iOS is <em>completely</em> different than it was in 2011.</p>

<h2>Where has iOS been all this time?</h2>

<p>Back when I used the Droid, Android was <em>way ahead</em> of Apple for many software features: the notification shade, quick settings on the notification shade, text selection, voice input, customizability, and, most of all, app extensibility (data sharing between apps, mostly) were <em>way better</em> on Android than on iOS. It would be fair to say that, in terms of user-facing features, iOS had a lot more ground to cover than Android did to improve <em>certain aspects</em> of user experience. My assessment now, with an Essential Phone and an iPhone 7 Plus at my disposal, is that Apple’s slow and steady advancement of iOS has allowed it to catch up to Android in all these areas, and exceed it in many of them.</p>

<p>The overall user interface design on iOS changed significantly in iOS 7, and has been refined and expanded upon in each iOS release since. Apple stole good user interface ideas from Android, such as the notification shade and the control center, but designed them differently and refined them each year, and implemented its own means of app extensibility in iOS 8, which has been slowly expanding in capabilities and usefulness year by year. An extensive number of indie developers’ embrace of x-callback-url for app extensibility has been a huge driver of inter-app communication and automation. App extensions, introduced by Apple in iOS 8, have matured into a cohesive ecosystem that does wonders for various workflows, especially those involving text and images. Apple’s Files app in iOS 11 allows third party storage providers, such as Dropbox, to have first-party-level integration with the OS and any apps that support the Files API. It is actually simple and seamless to use Dropbox with all sorts of iOS apps that were not written to support it. In this regard, Android is stuck in the same world as iOS 11 and earlier, where file service can be integrated, but each integration feels looser, more like a bolt-on feature or an afterthought.</p>

<p>It’s easy to think that iOS has been stagnant for many years because you still can’t arrange your app icons in arbitrary patterns on the screen, or change your default email app. If you can look beyond those customization points, you will see an enormous evolution in design and functionality on iOS, which is unmatched on the Android side.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>As an iOS developer, my job is never done, even though my app, <a href="http://swiftodoapp.com">SwiftoDo</a>, is internally simple and focused. There are always more features to add. There is competition in the App Store to worry about. There are third party libraries that deal with that break from time to time or have APIs change. Most of all, there is the regular drumbeat of regular iOS updates, which, frustratingly, can break standard UI controls and behaviors, and new hardware to support.</p>

<p>What I like about having my own iOS app is the act of creating something unique, something I actually use every day, and supporting other people who want to use it to. It is a lot of work, but it is also a lot of fun—except for migrating between Swift versions every year; that part I could do without, and hopefully the changes will be more minor as time goes on.</p>

<p>Right now I am trying to knock out several features that have been in development since this summer, and get it all done before Apple no longer supports builds from Xcode 8.3.3. I think, when I finally upgrade to Xcode 9 and do yet another Swift version upgrade of my code, I will drop support for iOS 9, and bump the minimum supported iOS version up to iOS 10.3, or maybe even iOS 11.0. I hate to do that, but support for the older SDK is probably causing me more trouble than it is worth at this point. Still, I don’t want to leave my iOS 9 users with an app that is broken or unstable in any way. That is why I have delayed dropping support so long now.</p>

         	<p>Early last month, I had the opportunity to acquire my first Android phone since the 2009 Motorola Droid: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Phone-Unlocked-Display-Camera/dp/B074BWGRKH/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;linkId=a240e9da453bf8ed853a813662ed6cc7">the Essential Phone</a>.

I am impressed with the hardware, disappointed with the camera, and, honestly, not impressed enough with the Android ecosystem to switch from my iPhone 7.</p>

<p>I am making it a point to use it every day, though, mostly to satisfy my curiosity about Android, and partly because it’s a beautiful peace of hardware that feels great in the hand. While no one needs two smartphones, getting this one has satisfied my curiosity about modern Android software and “bezel-less” phone hardware.</p>

<p>I plan to write more about my thoughts on Android, and about what I learned from my experience with the Essential Phone, in the near future.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/10/09/contexts-in-getting.html">Contexts in Getting Things Done and todo.txt</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/10/09/contexts-in-getting.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-10-09 23:00:00 -0400">Oct 9, 2017</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>One of the great insights of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a> (GTD) system is that tasks not only have projects, but contexts as well. A context is, basically, a thing or place or situation you need in order to do a task. Examples include: @home, @work, @phone, @computer, @errands, and so on. With projects and tasks, you can visualize your task list as a two-dimensional grid, with one row per project, and one column per context. This helps you determine what your next action should be. You can only do the tasks that are in the context you are currently in. That’s great, right?</p>

<h2>What good is a context when I have everything at hand at all times?</h2>

<p>Well&hellip;what I have found is that the typical set of contexts outlined in the “Getting Things Done” book are not really that useful to me. I only use my task list for work, so I’m always “@work”. I do all my work on a computer, which is portable, so I’m always “@computer”. I always have my mobile phone on me, so I’m always “@phone”. After diligently typing out these contexts in my todo.txt file and later ignoring them, for a long, long time, I realized that doing so was pointless. I only work in one context, so why bother to track it?</p>

<h2>A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds</h2>

<p>This was not immediately obvious to me because I was trying really hard to be a faithful GTD practitioner, and do everything that entails completely and correctly. When I realized that one of GTD’s key tools, the context, was useless to me, I felt lost. After rereading the “Getting Things Done” book, and trying even harder to commit to the system, I finally threw in the towel on contexts: I stopped using them entirely, for several years.</p>

<p>Doing so felt weird at first, and then liberating, like removing a little stumbling block from every task I wrote. I realized that following the system is not the important thing: getting my work done efficiently is the important thing. There was no point to keep adding contexts to tasks that did not need them.</p>

<h2>Not using contexts in GTD</h2>

<p>What I learned, obviously enough, is that not using contexts in GTD is <em>fine</em>. It doesn’t matter that it isn’t “pure” GTD. The system doesn’t matter; the results matter. If using contexts is just a minor drag on productivity, drop them and don’t give it a second thought.</p>

<h2>Using contexts again, differently than before</h2>

<p>After not using contexts for a few years, the nature of my work changed, and, as a consequence, I discovered new uses for them. My prior job entailed leading rather lengthy one-off audits, start to finish, with little commonality between them. My current job had me working mainly on data analytics procedures within over fifty similar audits, all performed over a several year period. Because of the highly structured nature of this work, and the tighter timeframes for producing deliverables, I sought to add more structure to my task list system. Contexts helped me do that.</p>

<p>The breakthrough for me was when I started using contexts to indicate phases of work (@planning, @development, @analysis, @reporting), and people I was working with (@Jo, @Susan, @Craig). These contexts had nothing to do with time, place, or equipment. Instead, they had to do with mental state (the type of <em>thinking</em> I had to do) and relationships with my coworkers. I am not always in the right mindset to perform a particular type of work (say, rigorous data analysis), and the people I am working with have different availability and expectations, so it is useful for me to keep track of those things in my task list.</p>

<h2>Using projects and contexts with todo.txt</h2>

<p>Todo.txt lets you manage your tasks using several axes: project and context, which tie directly to GTD concepts; and priority, which does not (though it is helpful to consider priority “A” your GTD “next action” indicator). While I have not come across any software that outputs your todo.txt file as a two-dimensional grid, pretty much all todo.txt apps have effective sorting and filtering capabilities. I filter and sort by todo.txt list on project and context numerous times throughout the day (mainly using <a href="http://swiftodoapp.com" title="My todo.txt app">SwiftoDo</a> on my iPad), as I complete tasks and try to identify my next actions. Sorting and filtering on project and context, and diligently setting and resetting priorities, helps me stay productive and avoid letting things fall through the cracks every day.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The <a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todotxt/">todo.txt format</a> does not support nested projects, which is something <a href="/2017/09/27/comparing-todotxt-and-taskpaper-formats/">outline-based formats such as TaskPaper do very well</a>. Fortunately, nested projects can be faked in todo.txt in a few different ways:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Use two project tags, as in: <code>write blog post +Blog +Plaintext</code></li>
    <li>Use one project and one context tag, as in: <code>write blog post +Blog @Plaintext</code></li>
    <li>Combine the project and sub-project in the project tag, as in: <code>write blog post +Blog-Plaintext</code></li>
</ol>

<p>I have found option 3 to work best for me, for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Multiple project tags can confound todo.txt applications’ sorting and filtering algorithms. It defeats the point of having nested-projects if you can't filter properly on them. </li>
    <li>I use contexts either for broad, overarching categories of work (@planning, @coding, @testing) or people (@Dave, @Greg, @Dom), so they are off limits for other uses. </li>
</ol>

<p>While the todo.txt format is not the best for planning hierarchical projects, it can be done with a simple workaround. Concatenation of the project and sub-project names is the best method for me.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I am a huge fan of managing my tasks using <a href="http://plaintext-productivity.net" title="I even wrote a guide about it!">plaintext</a> files. I mostly use todo.txt, but I have recently learned about the TaskPaper format. This is what I have learned about both formats.</p>

<h2>Both formats</h2>

<p>Both todo.txt and TaskPaper formats are, of course, plaintext files. You can open them in any text editor on any platform. There are several clients available on each of the major computing platforms specifically built to handle them. None of the clients controls your data or is able to lock you in. You are free to organize your task list any way you wish, and even to have multiple task list files. Both formats offer different ways to define projects and tasks, and both have some kind of tagging support, which helps in filtering tasks. You can also have multiple task list files, though most clients work with only one file at a time. Last, but not least, you are on your own when it comes to syncing your task list across systems. Dropbox is the most common third-party file sync service.</p>

<h2>Todo.txt</h2>

<h3>File format</h3>

<p>Todo.txt is a simple flat-file format—just a list of tasks, <a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todotxt/">in a particular format</a>—that was initially built for command-line querying. It acts as a junk drawer that you can throw stuff into and easily get out later through sorting, filtering, and searching. It is for the sort of person who, for example, archives all their email into one folder, figuring it can be found later with search, rather than those who file every message into an elaborate folder tree. It works for me because I tend to have dozens, and sometimes hundreds, of tasks at a time, spread across a variety of projects, with only minor dependencies between them.</p>

<h3>App ecosystem</h3>

<p>There are many todo.txt compatible apps on all the major platforms. I created <a href="http://swiftodoapp.com">SwiftoDo</a> (iOS) <a href="http://swiftodoapp.com/desktop/">SwiftoDo Desktop</a> (macOS), which are todo.txt apps highly focused on filtering and sorting tasks, and allowing for easy updating and reprioritizing. On Windows, <a href="https://github.com/benrhughes/todotxt.net">todotxt.net</a> is my favorite client. I sync them all via <a href="https://db.tt/CKgdD5kQ" title="My Dropbox affiliate link">Dropbox</a>. As long as you have a good client, like the ones I mention above, the todo.txt format is especially good for entering and managing large amounts of tasks, and rapidly reprioritizing them.</p>

<h2>TaskPaper</h2>

<h3>File format</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://support.hogbaysoftware.com/t/where-is-taskpapers-file-format-defined/2098?u=jessegrosjean">TaskPaper format</a> is much simpler than todo.txt’s format. It is a multi-level outline that includes support for tags and notes&hellip;and that’s it. It uses tags for just about everything: project, context, priority, due date, completed status, etc.</p>

<p>Because it is an outline, I find that the TaskPaper format is superior to todo.txt for <em>planning</em>—either project planning or simple day planning in my work journal. Having different outline levels makes it easy to see how tasks are grouped, ordered, and inter-dependent.</p>

<p>These strengths as an outliner are weaknesses, for me at least, when it comes to working through my task list, finding my next actions, and adjusting priorities to reflect what I need to work on next. The outline and order of tasks feels fixed in TaskPaper files, and it feels somewhat unnatural to sort and filter them. It is possible to flag all of the tasks to do today with a <code>@today</code> tag and filter the file to show them. I prefer to work with one very short TaskPaper file for the day, containing only the few tasks I plan to do that day, and mark tasks complete as the day progresses.</p>

<h3>App ecosystem</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.taskpaper.com">TaskPaper’s</a> macOS app is, as you would expect from the creator of the file format, the gold standard TaskPaper editor. It is clean, well thought-out, and deceptively simple. It has powerful outlining and filtering features that I admire, and extensive keyboard shortcuts that cover everything.</p>

<p>Because I have to work on Windows, I mostly use a bastardized version of TaskPaper format in <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>, using the <a href="https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks">PlainTasks</a> plugin. <a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">Editorial</a> on iOS is the best mobile app I have found that supports the format. It looks like the next version of <a href="https://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> will do so in the near future, as well. In my opinion, outside macOS, you are best off using a text editor for TaskPaper files.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Both todo.txt and TaskPaper are useful tools in the plaintext toolbox. I use todo.txt to manage all my tasks, but I use TaskPaper to plan new projects or to outline priorities for my workday.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/09/15/deciding-whether-to.html">Deciding Whether to Upgrade to the iPhone X</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/09/15/deciding-whether-to.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-09-15 23:00:00 -0400">Sep 15, 2017</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Last year, prior to Apple’s announcement of the iPhone 7, I had hoped for the “all-screen” design that was announced last week for the iPhone X. I was sure that would be my next phone. Now that it is here, one year later, I am not sure if I want it—at least not yet.</p>

<p>As an iPhone Upgrade Plan customer, I have three options at my disposal:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Do nothing, upgrade to something new next year, keep my iPhone 7, and give it to one of my kids, put it in a drawer, or sell it for peanuts in 2018.</li>
    <li>Pre-order the iPhone 8 Plus, which would presumably be available soon, as the most rabid Apple fans will prefer to skip it and get the X. I would have to turn in the iPhone 7 around month 12 or 13 of my 24-month payment plan.</li>
    <li>Wait until next month and pre-order the iPhone X via the iPhone Upgrade Plan. I would likely have to wait a couple months for the phone to be available (probably January). I would have to turn in the iPhone 7 around month 15 of my 24-month payment plan.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Cost: the main reason to skip the iPhone X for me</h2>

<p>The iPhone X starts at $999. The model with more storage that I would buy is $150 more, and AppleCare Plus costs about $200 on top of that. That represents a huge outlay for the phone. I don’t begrudge Apple for pricing the iPhone X so high, or other people for buying it without worrying about its cost. The high price is, however, a hint that the X may not be for me—at least not this year.</p>

<h2>Additional switching costs of an early upgrade</h2>

<p>While I love the idea of “renting” a smartphone with a fixed monthly cost (hardware as a service), it doesn’t really work that way. You actually have to buy the phone, and deal with the downsides that entails.</p>

<p>When I upgraded to the iPhone 7, I was surprised that I would have to pay 100% of the taxes on the new phone (about $100), plus a fee to activate it on my Verizon account (about $20). I had been thinking only about the difference in the monthly phone payment I would make, which was minuscule, and the expected cost to buy a new, compatible case. I was out over $100 for the new phone, and realized that I had already paid those costs one year earlier for the 7, and was giving up that hardware completely. On top of that, the case cost a lot, too (about $50). It is easy to forget about these costs when (1) the cost of the phone dwarfs them, and (2) the main cost of the phone is a relatively small monthly payment.</p>

<p>This year, wiser about the switching costs, I am just not sure if it is worth it to go from the 7 to the 8 Plus or X.</p>

<h2>Other reasons why I am iffy on the X</h2>

<p>Coming from the Plus, the iPhone X actually represents a step down in screen size (though it has a higher native resolution), lacks Touch ID, and has a smaller battery. I am not sure how my apps will look on the iPhone X screen. I bet developers will have to figure out how best to handle the notch and curved corners. (I am a little worried about my iOS app, <a href="http://swiftodoapp.com">SwiftoDo</a>, too.) Face ID might be slower or less convenient than Touch ID. Battery life might not be as good as on my one-year old, heavily used iPhone 7 Plus, or even the new iPhone 8 Plus.</p>

<p>Considering these minor drawbacks and unknowns, it might be nice to sit out the period in which users and developers figure out the new hardware, and Apple fixes any iPhone X-related software bugs.</p>

<h2>What about the iPhone 8 Plus?</h2>

<p>The iPhone 8 Plus is actually pretty attractive, despite having the same old (but good!) case design as the iPhone 6, 6S, and 7. I’m sure demand for it will be rather low, by iPhone standards. I would actually be able to get one soon. It is at least $300 cheaper than the iPhone X. The model I want costs $949, which is really expensive, but my monthly iPhone Upgrade Plan payment would not change.</p>

<h2>What to do?</h2>

<p>If money were no object, I would buy the X outright sometime soon and never use the iPhone Upgrade Plan again. Because that is not the case, I am leaning most heavily towards skipping an upgrade this year. I will deal with decreasing battery life and knowing I don’t have the best camera or performance anymore, but I will not suffer much. Or, I may just order the iPhone 8 Plus and not worry about the X until next year. I will go to an Apple Store in the next few weeks to test my resolve.</p>

         	<p>Sublime Text, my text editor of choice on Windows, Linux, and sometimes on the Mac, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-3-point-0">released version 3.0 tonight</a>.</p>

<p>I was surprised to learn the news, because I have been using Sublime Text 3 since 2013. Those were betas, of course, but were more solid and stable than most production software I used. I have been using beta versions for so long, I basically forgot that a final release would ever be forthcoming. There was, famously, about a year over which there were no beta updates, but the developer pulled through more recently with more frequent updates and meaningful new features (like High DPI support). Now, after several years of development, the release is marked complete.</p>

<p>I am a huge fan of this text editor. I use it constantly for many things. I even wrote popular articles about it in my <a href="http://plaintext-productivity.net">Plaintext Productivity</a> guide. Congratulations to the developer for wrapping up the release.</p>

<p>Now is a good time to buy a license, or pursue an upgrade. My 2013 Sublime Text 2 purchase qualified me for a free upgrade, so I am a very happy customer now.</p>

         	<p>I am a fan of the open web, and also a fan of people asking their audiences directly to pay to support content they find worthwhile. <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/new-a-list-apart-wants-you">A List Apart announced yesterday</a> that they are pulling away from their advertising-based funding model, which apparently was not working well for them anymore, toward a volunteering and patronage model, which will draw from the community that reads and loves the site. I think this reflects a trend that is starting to separate &ldquo;the open web&rdquo; (community-based sites) from the big commercial sites (Google and Facebook, mostly), based on funding models and even content types.</p>

<p>I learned <em>so much</em> from A List Apart over the years. As a publication, it means an awful lot to me and my professional career. I am somewhat sad to admit that I stopped reading it after I shifted away from its core topics, web design and development, and moved toward finance, data analytics, and audit. I am not longer part of its core audience or community, but I wholeheartedly wish them, and the site&rsquo;s readers, writers, and editors, well.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/08/30/the-iphone-home.html">The iPhone home button</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://micro.mjdescy.me/2017/08/30/the-iphone-home.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-08-30 23:00:00 -0400">Aug 30, 2017</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>There is news today that Apple&rsquo;s next-generation iPhone—the rumored high-end one—is not only going to remove the physical home button (everyone has assumed that for a while), but it will also not replace it with an on-screen simulacrum (people like me have expected a circle icon to act as the home button). The plan, apparently, is to kill the home button entirely, and replace it with a dock of icons, like the iOS 11 betas have on the iPad. That is a bit surprising to me. Whether it is true or not, this news made me want to pause a minute and reflect on how brilliant Apple&rsquo;s home button was.</p>

<h2>Simplicity</h2>

<p>As the one, single button on the front of the phone, it was the ultimate escape key. Can&rsquo;t find an exit app button onscreen? Did an app hang? Does an app confuse you? Is the screen black for no reason? Just press the <em>only physical button on the front of the phone</em> and return to the home screen.</p>

<p>It sounds so simple and obvious, but no one else had anything quite like it. (OK, Samsung copied it soon afterward, but that barely counts.) Most Android phones came with &ldquo;soft buttons&rdquo;, onscreen buttons or tap-able areas below the screen. But there were more of them–remember back, home, menu, and search?–or they had weird, almost meaningless icons-square, circle, triangle-that you had to figure out.</p>

<h2>Physical orientation</h2>

<p>A side benefit of a physical home button was that you could feel it with your thumb, and always know which way you were holding the phone by touch alone. When it inevitably goes away, I will miss the familiar sensation of finding it when the phone is in my pocket, to orient my hand and to use as a pivot as I swing the phone around to use it.</p>

<h2>Consistency</h2>

<p>Over time, the home button was overloaded to do multitasking and Touch ID, but it always served its original purpose, and Apple never screwed it up, even with its non-moving, Taptic Engine-driven style in the iPhone 7. (That phone&rsquo;s haptic feedback feels incredible.)</p>

<p>Obviously, Android&rsquo;s early move from physical buttons to soft-buttons approach worked out all right, but, to me, Apple&rsquo;s stalwart refusal to ditch the physical home button over many generations of iPhone reflected, in my opinion, a design ethic centered upon simplicity and humanism, which I really respected.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sorry to see (presumably) the home button go, but it was definitely one of the reasons I admired the design of the iPhone, and ditched my Android phone for one years ago.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>It seems that many programmers who are actually <em>programming</em> on iPads are writing code that runs elsewhere, either on a web server, or on a remote system they SSH into. That doesn&rsquo;t describe what I do anymore. My non-work programming has shifted almost entirely to Swift, due to my obvious love of Apple platforms and my love of the language. This makes the iPad Pro less than useful for my programming needs.</p>

<p>I code in Xcode. Developers have been awaiting Xcode for iPad for years now, despite nearly nothing coming out of Cupertino to indicate that this will ever happen. Xcode on iPad would be great, I guess, but it seems too big and too complicated for me to even contemplate on iOS. I don&rsquo;t think I would even want to develop full apps on the iPad, but I would love to work on models, custom subclasses to iOS controls, and creating unit tests, even when I&rsquo;m away from my MacBook.</p>

<p>I know Swift Playgrounds exists, but I really wish there was something more fully-featured than it available. It doesn&rsquo;t let me export my work to anywhere I can use it, which is the largest problem. I know I could code Swift on an simple text editor on the iPad, but what I really want is a compiler. Coding in Xcode is like having a conversation with the compiler, and seeing what it will allow you to do. I like that. I wish I could do that on the iPad, perhaps in a multi-file playground and export it to a Git client like Working Copy. I could get a ton of work done that way, without even trying to build and test a full app.</p>

<p>Perhaps Apple will make me happy this fall, when iOS 11 is finalized, or next year with iOS 12.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Setting up a new iPad is an opportunity to start over with a clean slate, and fix whatever problems you have on your old device&rsquo;s setup. Fortunately, operating stability tends not to be a problem these days. What is a problem, however, is the sheer number of apps you can end up having installed, and the many notifications that come with them.</p>

<h2>An app strategy</h2>

<p>The App Store started out with a Unix-like philosophy about software. Remember the phrase “there’s an app for that?” Most apps did one thing. Most people do a lot of things, so we end up with a whole lot of apps. Not much has changed over time. Springboard, the launcher on iOS, is deliberately primitive. All your apps are spread out across various home screen pages. Once you have more than two or three pages, it is really hard to remember where all your apps are. Apps can be grouped into folders, but once in folders they are harder to find, unless you have a good organizational strategy.</p>

<p>With a new device, such as my new iPad Pro, I simply don’t install apps unless I need them right then. For those apps that get installed, I reduce their notifications to a bare minimum. If you get notifications on your phone, and you always have your phone with you, do you really need them on your iPad? Probably not.</p>

<p>Even after doing these smart-sounding things, I have 72 applications on my iPad Pro (and this is a machine with zero games on it!). Because of this, I often use Spotlight search to launch apps. I do this on my iPhone, too, where it feels inferior to tapping an icon. I’m learning, however, that on the iPad, just as on my Mac, it’s the right way to do it.</p>

<p>(I probably use about ten productivity apps most of the time, and those apps will likely be in the Dock once I install iOS 11, but I still use at least 20 of those other apps on a daily basis for reading, scanning, and videos.)</p>

<h2>How do you launch an app on an iPad?</h2>

<p>With the keyboard, just like on a Mac. Simply hit Command+Space to launch Spotlight, type the first few letters of an app&rsquo;s name, and hit Enter. Without a hardware keyboard, pull down on the home screen to launch Spotlight, and type with the onscreen keyboard.</p>

<p>This behavior is fast and efficient. As a side benefit, it <em>drastically</em> reduces the need to organize apps efficiently on the SpringBoard.</p>

<h2>Home screen organization with activity-based folders</h2>

<p>I tried briefly to <em>not</em> organize the Springboard at all, but I ended up with several pages of apps and it looked like a jumbled mess. So I went into the other direction: I put <em>everything</em> into folders, all of which fit on one screen. The folder names are all verbs, based on activities:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Configure (iOS Settings, IoT device settings, and apps related to fixing things on my home server)</li>
    <li>Secure (VPN, and password and other authentication-related apps)</li>
    <li>Plan (Calendar, Reminders, Maps, brainstorming apps, etc.)</li>
    <li>File (cloud data providers)</li>
    <li>Communicate (Mail, Messages, FaceTime, etc.)</li>
    <li>Scan</li>
    <li>Photo (“photo” is stretching it as a verb, I admit)</li>
    <li>Draw</li>
    <li>Eat (MyFitnessPal, recipe apps)</li>
    <li>Program (my BitBucket app and Pythonista, for now)</li>
    <li>Shop</li>
    <li>Read</li>
    <li>Write</li>
    <li>Watch</li>
    <li>Play (this one <em>would</em> be there if I had games on my iPad Pro)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other verbs, such as “research” and “listen”, may be useful for folder names in the future, if my hobbies and/or media diet increase.</p>

<p>The apps within the folders are not organized. Unless I have more than 16 apps in a folder, all the icons are visible at once, and their order does not matter to me.</p>

<p>My Dock contains the six apps I use all the time throughout my work day: Safari, Overcast, Music, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swiftodo-desktop-task-list-for-todo-txt/id1143641091?ls=1&amp;mt=12">SwiftoDo</a> (my todo.txt task list), Drafts, and Ulysses. When I put iOS 11 on this machine, my use of the Dock will change somewhat, mostly by allowing me to put more apps in it.</p>

<p>(I don’t have a junk or “Apple” folder for unused and unloved default apps anymore. Since iOS 10, you can remove (hide, really) Apple’s default apps that you don&rsquo;t use. I just do that.)</p>

<h2>After a couple weeks of this</h2>

<p>This organization scheme is working out very well for me. It helps keep me focused on what I’m doing and what I intend to do, and kind of forces me to use Spotlight to both launch and switch between apps, which is the behavior I want to reinforce. (It is still ingrained in me, based on how iOS worked prior to multitasking, to close an app and go to the home screen to switch apps, but it is not necessary to do so, and it is faster not to.)</p>

         	<p>Having given up on a keyboard case, I felt adrift in subpar options for an iPad stand and case. I admit, it is not that hard to get something decent; most people would just buy an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071JNCDSN/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B071JNCDSN&amp;linkId=18e43bde2b382e5972069112e934f266">Apple Smart Cover</a> (or a decent knockoff) and be done with it. I, however, wanted something very specific, something I had in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012VOP2QO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B012VOP2QO&amp;linkId=c89ff7b8355ddaf1ea8315de933294ad">my old iPad Air 2 case</a>, which is apparently rare: a kickstand.</p>

<p>The reason is that the kickstand made my iPad feel rock solid. It never moved or wobbled on a table. It never fell down because the folded up case collapsed beneath it. It felt real and solid, like a high quality tool rather than a fragile slice of glass and metal.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HIS30OY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01HIS30OY&amp;linkId=e7e97bd9bf7377f3fa85da4e0954bdd7">Logitech Create</a> keyboard case (which I didn&rsquo;t like) had a kickstand, but nothing else I could find at the Apple Store or on Amazon did. Apple&rsquo;s Smart Cover seemed expensive and far worse as a stand than what I had for my old iPad. There was a charging stand, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1LTI3L/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01M1LTI3L&amp;linkId=40e05b6371265d10c8f40d9fe4ef40c3">Logi Base</a>, that looked like a good, sturdy platform, but was overpriced, had a number of unfavorable user reviews, and was not a case at all, so it was an incomplete solution. I basically didn&rsquo;t want to spend so much on either case or stand, but after lots of thinking and comparison shopping, I bit the bullet and bought them both. I am very happy I did.</p>

<h2>An extravagance, but a nice one</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1LTI3L/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01M1LTI3L&amp;linkId=40e05b6371265d10c8f40d9fe4ef40c3">Logi Base</a>, once you get over the initial cost of it, is unexpectedly great. It&rsquo;s a stand that charges the iPad through the Smart Connector. Unlike a folded-up Smart Cover, it is rock solid. It basically sticks to the desk, and provides the iPad a secure backing. You can bang the screen with your fingers and it would not move. That, for me, is key. A wobbly iPad feels like a toy. A secure one feels like the future of computing.</p>

<p>Docking and undocking are simple: a strong magnet helps keep everything in place. Charging through the Smart Connector works just fine. Numerous product reviewers complained that charging is slow and doesn&rsquo;t support fast charging. Perhaps that is true, but charging is fast enough to keep up with battery use, and then some, which is all I actually need.</p>

<p>The final thing that delights me about the Base is that it actually gives me a place for the Pencil. It has a tiny amount of ledge space in front of the iPad that is just big enough for the Pencil to rest on its side. There is just enough magnetism there (it is near the Smart Connector) to keep the Pencil there rather safely.</p>

<h2>Necessary protection</h2>

<p>While a stand is nice for desktop use, you still should have something to protect the iPad&rsquo;s screen sometimes. I bought the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071JNCDSN/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B071JNCDSN&amp;linkId=18e43bde2b382e5972069112e934f266">Apple Smart Cover</a> for travel, whether around town or around the house. I actually take it off (you have to) and store it in a desk drawer when the iPad Pro is on the Logi stand. I did spend more on it than it is worth to me, but when I ordered it, cheaper third party cases were not widely available yet. I find that I take the Smart Cover off when actually using the iPad, and put it back on when I put the iPad away. That&rsquo;s different than how I&rsquo;ve treated every other iPad/case combination I&rsquo;ve owned, largely due to the difference in size and weight between the 9.7&rdquo; and 12.9&rdquo; iPads.</p>

<p>All in all, I am happier using the iPad with no case, and it stays on the Logi Base at my desk most of the time anyway.</p>

         	<p>I just spent $30 on an annual subscription to Ulysses, my favorite writing app (it is not <em>quite</em> a &quot;text editor&quot;) on macOS and iOS. It was a relatively expensive macOS and iOS app for years, and I thought of it as the best buy I ever made on the platform, because I always bought it on steep discount the day it was released, and upgrades have been free ever since. As much as I love it, I have never used it enough, mostly because I spend time programming rather than writing. That may change now, however, because I am paying now a lot more for the privilege to use it. Overall, I decided it is worth my money to continually support the software I love. That said, the much higher cost of Ulysses and other apps I rely on probably means I will be trying and buying far fewer alternatives. </p><p>There is a limit on how much I want to pay each year, total, for software. I am not sure what that limit is, however. It is over $100, I guess, based on my spending history. But it&apos;s not that much higher than that&#x2014;and I am a person who <em>loves</em> software. I will have to choose my apps with way more discipline and effort now that many will be an ongoing cost to me. I will be choosing just one text editor for $30 per year, rather than buying the top six of them for $5 apiece and maybe upgrading one or two of them to new versions, for another $5 apiece, after a couple of years.</p><p>I hope this arrangement will lead to better software, and more well-supported software, overall. It looks like it will have the side effect of reducing the number of apps on my home screen to an essential, more costly, more sophisticated few. That&apos;s not necessarily a bad thing. But it further raises the bar for new indie developers&#x2014;those without venture backing&#x2014;who are working on the next new thing.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>iPads are great for writing, but if you are a touch typist, you need an external keyboard to have a top-notch experience.</p>

<p>I am a touch typist, and used to be a very fast touch typist as well, until RSI (repetitive stress injury) slowed me down to more reasonable speeds. Due to RSI, and the fact that using an ill-suited keyboard physically <em>hurts</em>, I am very picky about keyboards. I prefer a keyboard that is clicky and gives me a precise feeling when the key is activated. Mushy keyboards, by contrast, are awful for me; my accuracy decreases, and retyping increases. Key spacing basically has to be as close to a full-size key board as possible for me, because my hands cramp up when typing on anything smaller than a standard MacBook keyboard. Travel distance is important, too. Too little throw on a keyboard, such as on the first generation 12&rdquo; MacBook, makes my fingers hurt.</p>

<p>As I said, I am hard to please when it comes to keyboards.
<h2>Smart Connector Keyboards</h2>
The iPad Pro comes with a special connector, mostly useful for keyboards, called the Smart Connector. It promises rock solid communication between the iPad and the keyboard, meaning no dropped keypresses, which are my chief complaint about using Bluetooth keyboards. Unfortunately, there are only two keyboards that pair with the Smart Connector on the iPad Pro: Apple&rsquo;s Smart Keyboard and Logitech&rsquo;s Create Backlit Keyboard.</p>

<p>Trying out these two keyboards, however, quickly led to disappointment. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0186RZAWQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0186RZAWQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;linkId=4c9ddcd7c23e99d9251ddb4e71643801">Apple Smart Keyboard</a> just felt awkward to type on. It has very little tactile feedback, and almost no throw. It is floppy enough to be poorly suited for use on the lap (which, admittedly, would be rare). The case it comes attached to is slim, versatile, lightweight (for what it is, not overall), andstylish. But, alas, it is not for me.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KG0X7P8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B01KG0X7P8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;linkId=10161348aa4edd1d8e01e26ae9045672">Logitech Create Backlit Keyboard</a>, at first, appears to correct all of the Apple Smart Keyboard&rsquo;s shortcomings. It has real keys! It has decent key travel! It has a sturdy kickstand case instead of a floppy folding case! While it has real keys, and more features plus a lower price than the Apple Smart Keyboard, typing on one for a while felt awful to me. It started to feel mushy to me. It is also much heavier than the Smart Keyboard. I loved the kickstand, but I wanted something I could remove more easily, because the 12.9&rdquo; iPad Pro is heavy enough on its own when used handheld.</p>

<p>So, after lots of time trying them out, both Smart Connector keyboards were out of the running for me.
<h2>What about Bluetooth keyboards?</h2>
While there are hundreds of Bluetooth keyboards you can pair with any iPad, they have a couple drawbacks. The main one for me is dropped keystrokes, due either to flaky Bluetooth connections, low quality components, or the keyboard requiring a keypress to wake from sleep. A secondary one is that they require batteries or recharging of their internal battery periodically, but that period is a few months long. Lastly, Bluetooth pairing can be tricky, especially if you try to use the same keyboard with multiple devices.</p>

<p>After trying out and being disappointed by the typing experience on the Apple and Logitech Smart Connector keyboards, I went back to my favorite keyboard of recent years, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016QO64FI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B016QO64FI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mjdescy-20&amp;linkId=fe064dbc2ef2450d6b735c756c6c8912">Apple Magic Keyboard</a>. It&rsquo;s a full-size keyboard, which is comfortable to type on. It has a shallow keyfall distance, but it is not as shallow as the 12&rdquo; MacBook. Keypresses feel solid and clicky. The battery lasts for months. Build quality is top notch.</p>

<p>I have not had any problems with dropped keystrokes when waking up the Magic Keyboard, but that is likely because my new iPad Pro itself goes to sleep, which is an option I had disabled on my old iPad. Whatever the reason, a single keypress wakes up the iPad Pro and I go on to typing without thinking about it. That&rsquo;s good enough for me.</p>

<p>So, after an honest effort to upgrade to on of the Smart Connector keyboards, I passed on both of them, and settled for the Apple Magic Keyboard, because it offers the best typing experience for me. I am actually surprised about that, and a little disappointed that I did not like the other two options. Because I went with a detached keyboard, I had to consider different case and stand options, which I will go into in a later post.</p>

         	<h2>Choosing between iPad Pro sizes</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a definite trade-off between size and portability when choosing between the two sizes of iPad Pro. The 10.5&rdquo; version is lighter and more portable—it&rsquo;s essentially the same as the familiar 9.7&rdquo; model. The 12.9&rdquo; version is heavier and has a larger screen, and, unfortunately, has larger bezels as well (it is the same size as the prior 12.9&rdquo; model).</p>

<h2>Smaller</h2>

<p>The smaller iPad Pro <em>is</em> nicer to hold in your hands for long periods of time. Even more importantly, if you read books on it in bed, where the screen is only about 12&rdquo; away from your eyes, as I do, it <em>is</em> easier to read on. Because you can focus on the whole screen at once, you don&rsquo;t need to move your eyes as much. It is small, but it is perfectly usable for productivity as well as videos and reading.</p>

<h2>Larger</h2>

<p>The larger iPad Pro is, in my opinion, an even better size for getting work done. The 12.9&rdquo; screen, when paired with a hardware keyboard, feels like a computer screen for productivity apps. It&rsquo;s barely smaller than my old 13.3&rdquo; MacBook. There is plenty of room for multitasking and slide-over. It also feels even better for handwriting and drawing, because the usable screen area is basically the same size as a standard piece of paper (i.e., A4 or Letter size), which feels natural.</p>

<h2>Trade-offs</h2>

<p>Does the additional size and weight make it less useful as a tablet? In short: yes, but only a little.</p>

<p>The 12.9&rdquo; iPad Pro (2017 model) weighs about as much as the iPad 4th generation (about 1.5 lbs), so weight is not really a problem for handheld use, at least when held without a case. Apple&rsquo;s Smart Cover comes off easily, so you could just take it off to read with for long periods of time, and put it back on when you want to protect the screen. Also, the weight is very well balanced, so you can hold it in one hand comfortably despite its size.</p>

<p>As for reading in bed or in an easy chair, the larger model is slightly worse. It&rsquo;s more natural to read such a large screen at an arm&rsquo;s length away, rather than perched on your stomach or thereabouts. The large screen has the same DPI as the smaller iPad Pro, so crispness at that distance is not a problem. It&rsquo;s just too big to focus on the whole thing evenly, unless it&rsquo;s about as far from your eyes as your laptop screen normally would be. (This is, obviously, a very small problem in the grand scheme of things.)</p>

<h2>It's easy to have no trade-offs when you can just have both</h2>

<p>One reason behind my purchase of a <em>12.9&rdquo;</em> iPad Pro was that I realized that I didn&rsquo;t <em>necessarily</em> have to give up my old 9.7&rdquo; iPad Air after doing so. Sure, it might be the smart thing to get back $100 or so by selling it, or it might be nice to give it to someone else in my family, but it is still worth a lot more to me than it is to somebody else. (I admit, it does help that my kids are too young to care about electronic devices.) This decision made it much easier to go for the larger-sized tablet.</p>

<p>So, if you already have a smaller-than-12.9&rdquo; iPad, like I do? Honestly, if you can get away with it, keep the old iPad around for reading and use the new, larger one for desktop use.</p>

         	<p>Why did I start a blog in 2017, <em>when nobody reads blogs anymore</em>?</p>

<p>Simple: I want to own my content.</p>

<p>I want to write posts, and to have something that reflects myself and my work on the Internet. Plus, it&rsquo;s nice when <a href="https://www.google.com/search?query=Michael%20Descy" title="Search for me!">Google Searches for my name</a> turn up something more interesting than my LinkedIn profile.</p>

<p>I care more about writing right now than reaching the largest audience. I&rsquo;ve found from blogging in the past that people eventually find your best content; you just have to put it out there.

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>When iOS 11 and the new iPad Pro were announced at this year&rsquo;s WWDC, I was very excited and more than a little confused. I was excited because the hardware looked fantastic, and I knew I was going to buy one. I was confused because iOS 11 made me no longer know what the iPad was for.</p>

<h2>Excitement</h2>

<p>Long before WWDC 2017, I decided I would use some of the earnings from my <a href="http://swiftodoapp.com" title="SwiftoDo">iOS app</a> and <a href="http://swiftodoapp.com/desktop" title="SwiftoDo Desktop">Mac app</a> (todo.txt task lists, under the name SwiftoDo) to upgrade my iPad Air 2 to the newest model—whatever Apple would release next. I had hopes for a larger-screen, smaller bezel iPad, which ended up being the 10.5&rdquo; iPad Pro.</p>

<p>Even though the tech press has decried slow iPad sales for years now, I absolutely <em>love</em> the iPad. I use one for music, podcasts, videos, writing, Twitter, web browsing, and reading at least 8 hours every day. (It helps that I work from home.) I love the screen. I love the touch interface. I love driving it with a Bluetooth keyboard. I love how native apps can deliver a superior experience to web pages. I even love <em>developing</em> apps for the platform.</p>

<p>Since I purchased my 2013 MacBook Pro, I have bought three iPads (not counting the Pro model I was considering) and zero MacBook Pros. This year I was not really due for an upgrade, but I use the iPad so much, I decided it was worth it.</p>

<h2>Confusion</h2>

<p>Despite my general iPad Pro excitement, I was also confused, because iOS 11 looked to me like a <em>computer</em> operating system, rather than a <em>tablet</em> operating system. iOS 11&rsquo;s new app launching dock, file-oriented architecture, and extensive drag-and-drop support gave me the impression that it made the iPad more like the next generation of Mac, rather than a tablet.</p>

<p>This is important because, to me, and iPad is way more intimate a product than a computer. I read on it at the breakfast table and in bed. I listen to music all day at work, and sometimes just have it display a big clock or the blank text area of a note-taking app. These are things I would never dedicate an entire laptop to. But a tablet is small, low power, and low stress.</p>

<p>I installed a developer beta of iOS 11 on my iPad Air 2 to get an idea of how the new UI worked. I also visited my local Apple Store to look at the 10.5&rdquo; iPad Pros the day they were released. I actually walked right right past them; the store had replaced all the 9.7&rdquo; models with 10.5&rdquo; models, and I could barely tell the difference. After a minute I found the 2017 9.7&rdquo; iPad (the new budget/consumer model) and a new 2017 10.5&rdquo; iPad Pro side by side. The difference in size was more slight than I had imagined. The larger size was obviously an improvement over my iPad Air 2 screen, but it didn&rsquo;t feel like a big enough difference to warrant an upgrade. I was actually a little upset, because I really wanted to upgrade to the newest iPad, but the 10.5&rdquo; model did not seem much better than the iPad Air 2.</p>

<h1>A surprising decision (at least to me)</h1>

<p>What dawned on me at the Apple Store was that iOS 11 would make the 12.9&rdquo; iPad Pro, which I had previously thought was ridiculously oversized, very attractive. With a keyboard, it would be a much better <em>desktop computer</em> than the 10.5&rdquo; model. Without a keyboard, and indeed without a case, it would light enough to hold while reading in bed, and not really too large for that either. It would have better software and require less maintenance than my MacBook Pro, and would be a lot more fun to use. So I played with one for a while and decided to buy it.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m writing this blog post on it, and plan to write more about the other hardware I bought to go along with it, and the changes I made to its software. It&rsquo;s a wonderful device, and is clearly, with iOS 11 on the horizon, the next iteration of the Mac.</p>
